mortgage documents into certain categories(type of documents) and extracting some entities from this documents.\n\nNow some underliers of their current solution:\n1. Documents are received in format of tif/pdf. OCR of a 3rd party is run to convert them into text. \n2. The documents are then being indexed by using direct communication with database using Python. There is no ML model here but a header logic where the names of the documents against the OCR texts are stored in a table and communicated. Also a jaccard logic where sometimes documents have no header names but a similarity comparison logic against the information in the database. \n(This works about 90% of the time but is very slow because of db communication). \n3. For extraction of entities there is no ML logic but regex queries in .NET. As a result most of the information gets missed and about 10% - 15% of information is extracted. \n\nNow obviously management is looking for some better time management and output. \n\nThe solution I have implemented:\n1. Taking the indexing logic in a SVM model. Getting the desired output for indexing in a very minimal time rate. \n2. For extraction I am looking at spaCy EntityRecognizer. I am annotating using doccano and then using arcgis spacy NER for the training. \n\nNow my question, is have you guys used spaCy EntityRecognizer in a similar manner for a project?

Documents are received in format of tif/pdf. OCR of a 3rd party is run to convert them into text. \n2. The documents are then being indexed by using direct communication with database using Python. There is no ML model here but a header logic where the names of the documents against the OCR texts are stored in a table and communicated. Also a jaccard logic where sometimes documents have no header names but a similarity comparison logic against the information in the database. \n(This works about 90% of the time but is very slow because of db communication). \n3. For extraction of entities there is no ML logic but regex queries in .NET. As a result most of the information gets missed and about 10% - 15% of information is extracted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now obviously management is looking for some better time management and output. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution I have implemented:\n1. Taking the indexing logic in a SVM model. Getting the desired output for indexing in a very minimal time rate. \n2. For extraction I am looking at spaCy EntityRecognizer.
