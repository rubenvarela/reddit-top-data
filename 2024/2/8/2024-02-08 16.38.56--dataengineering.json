In my experience it&amp;#39;s not a good idea, because sometimes, in job interviews they ask in-depth questions about a particular language, for example how the GC works in the JVM, you may even be given some code and asked if it compiles... etc. You may have to write some stuff in Java or Scala using functional programming, and if you have been focusing on Python for a few months, you literally forget certain details of the syntax and tell the interviewer &amp;quot;Sorry, I forgot how to do this one little thing in Scala, I need to google, because I&amp;#39;ve been doing some python recently&amp;quot; and they may think that you are not the right fit for this job, you know?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your opinion on all this? As you can see I lean towards sticking with Scala, but I know almost nothing about Python, so maybe you guys can convince me that I should switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "1alffov", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Outrageous-Heat-6353", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 52, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/1alffov/is_switching_to_python_from_scalajava_in_big_data/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1alffov/is_switching_to_python_from_scalajava_in_big_data/", "subreddit_subscribers": 159237, "created_utc": 1707344385.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Hello Data Enthusiasts!\n\nI've been exploring a fascinating aspect of data quality and integrity that's crucial for anyone working with historical data, especially in the context of dbt (Data Build Tool): **Drift Testing**. This method is not just about identifying issues; it's about proactively ensuring our data's reliability over time, particularly through dbt's snapshotting capabilities.\n\n**What is Drift Testing with dbt?**\n\nDrift testing in the realm of dbt involves analyzing and monitoring changes in your data over time to ensure consistency and accuracy. It's particularly relevant when using dbt's snapshot feature, which captures and stores historical data changes. By applying drift testing to these snapshots, we can detect any unintended alterations in our data's behavior or structure, ensuring our historical records remain a reliable foundation for analysis and decision-making.\n\n**Implementing Drift Testing in dbt**\n\nImplementing drift testing with dbt involves a few key steps:\n\n* **Snapshotting Your Data**: Utilize dbt's snapshot feature to capture the state of your data at regular intervals. This forms the basis of your historical dataset for drift testing.\n* **Defining Drift Tests**: \n\n1. Create a *\\*.datadrift.py*  tests file that define what constitutes an acceptable change in your data. This could involve statistical measures or specific business rules relevant to your data's context. [Follow this doc](https://github.com/data-drift/data-drift/blob/main/tools/driftdb/dbt-snapshot-testing-docs/dbt-snapshot-testing.md)\n2. Then run `driftdb snapshot check`  \n\n* **Automating Tests**: \n\n1. Configure an alert transport to create github issues or slack message\n2. Incorporate these tests into your dbt workflows to run automatically, ensuring continuous monitoring of your data's quality and consistency.\n\n* **Troubleshoot:**\n\n1. Within the alert you have the context of the drift and a command `driftdb snaphsot show` to understand the lineage change, or the code change that introduce the drift.  \n\n\nIf you like the subject please star us: [https://github.com/data-drift/data-drift](https://github.com/data-drift/data-drift) and [join the waitlist](https://www.data-drift.io/).\n\nThanks for reading \ud83d\udc9a", "author_fullname": "t2_10uv2n", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Unveiling Drift Testing: The Unsung Hero in Maintaining Historical Data Integrity", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1alszxs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Open Source", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1707389279.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Data Enthusiasts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been exploring a fascinating aspect of data quality and integrity that&amp;#39;s crucial for anyone working with historical data, especially in the context of dbt (Data Build Tool): &lt;strong&gt;Drift Testing&lt;/strong&gt;.

I would also love some advices about getting into Data Engineering as a beginner :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your help&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "92b74b58-aaca-11eb-b160-0e6181e3773f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "id": "1alrme0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chediras", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/1alrme0/is_masters_necessary/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1alrme0/is_masters_necessary/", "subreddit_subscribers": 159237, "created_utc": 1707383345.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI am a data engineer and I was wondering if there is any information security certification (like CISSP, etc) I can take to boost my career in DE field.\n\nRegards,", "author_fullname": "t2_dcnhwe2o", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Information Security skills for Data Engineer", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1ale3kb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1707341055.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a data engineer and I was wondering if there is any information security certification (like CISSP, etc) I can take to boost my career in DE field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "1ale3kb", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MediumCat4064", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/1ale3kb/information_security_skills_for_data_engineer/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ale3kb/information_security_skills_for_data_engineer/", "subreddit_subscribers": 159237, "created_utc": 1707341055.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "I'm asking here because I assume you all know so much better.\n\nI'm not a data engineer and I'm working now just using Colab for a project I need to automate.

I work in a software dev team, but i mostly have worked on SAP HANA, PL/SQL, and have dabbled a bit in Snowflake, Redshift, Glue, etc\n\nThings are saturating, and I want to shift for better learning ,and obviously a better pay.\n\nBut I don't want to continue with current work, as the technology i work on is a bit dated. I don't like React and Node based development. (I have tried, gone through courses, i couldn't create any interest in it sadly). I know I love databases and like to solve the issues in them, especially SQL.\n\nSo I have come to the conclusion that Data engineering is probably a good job to aim for.
