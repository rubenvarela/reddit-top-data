I have been working with data teams for the past 10 years and have seen the data landscape evolve from **traditional databases** to **modern data lakes** and **data warehouses**.\n\nIn previous roles, I\u2019ve been working closely with customers of AdTech, MarTech and Fintech companies. As an engineer, I\u2019ve built features and products that helped marketers, advertisers and B2C companies engage with their customers better. Dealing with vast amounts of data, that either came from online or offline sources, I always found myself in the middle of newer challenges that came with the data.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve faced is the ability to move data from one system to another. This is a problem that has been around for a long time and is often referred to as **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**. Consolidating data from multiple sources and storing it in a single place is a common problem and while working with teams, I have built custom ETL pipelines to solve this problem.\n\nHowever, there were no mature platforms that could solve this problem at scale. Then as **AWS Glue, Google Dataflow and Apache Nifi** came into the picture, I started to see a shift in the way data was being moved around. Many OSS platforms like *Airbyte, Meltano and Dagster* have come up in recent years to solve this problem.\n\nNow that we are at the cusp of a new era in modern data stacks, 7 out of 10 are using cloud data warehouses and data lakes.\n\nThis has now made life easier for data engineers, especially when I was struggling with ETL pipelines. But later in my career, I started to see a new problem emerge. When marketers, sales teams and growth teams operate with top-of-the-funnel data, while most of the data is stored in the data warehouse, it is not accessible to them, which is a big problem.\n\nThen I saw data teams and growth teams operate in silos. Data teams were busy building ETL pipelines and maintaining the data warehouse. In contrast, growth teams were busy using tools like **Braze, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Salesforce, Hubspot**, etc. to engage with their customers.\n\n# \ud83d\udcab The Genesis of Multiwoven\n\nAt the initial stages of Multiwoven, our initial idea was to build a product notification platform for product teams, to help them send targeted notifications to their users. But as we started to talk to more customers, we realized that the problem of data silos was much bigger than we thought. We realized that the problem of data silos was not just limited to product teams, but was a problem that was faced by every team in the company.\n\nThat\u2019s when we decided to pivot and build Multiwoven, a **reverse ETL** platform that helps companies move data from their data warehouse to their SaaS platforms. We wanted to build a platform that would help companies make their data actionable across different SaaS platforms.\n\n# \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Why Open Source?\n\nAs a team, we are strong believers in open source, and the reason behind going open source was twofold. Firstly, cost was always a counterproductive aspect for teams using commercial SAAS platforms. Secondly, we wanted to build a flexible and customizable platform that could give companies the control and governance they needed.\n\n***This has been our humble beginning and we are excited to see where this journey takes us. We are excited to see the impact we can make in the data activation landscape.***\n\n&gt;*Please \u2b50 star our* [*repo on Github*](https://github.com/Multiwoven/multiwoven) *and show us some love.

My manager has said he will change my team whatever i want he will give me but I don\u2019t believe him much, he is a toxic manager. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know what to do because the new place will be more challenging, new thing to work on, more independence etc. but will be paid a little less and the hours are 2-10pm and in a remote town away from where i am living (during the probation period for three months, will move to my current city office after that). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly i am in a comfort zone with my current employer. I am almost 25, want to excel in DE domain. I want to be convinced that i need to move to make something out of my career. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another option is i take the counter and look for a better opportunity in the next 3-5 months because ultimately i want to leave my current employer. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,

a system that aims to provide better ability to create and manage schedules in resource-constrained projects.\n\nWhat I mean by \u201cresource-constrained\u201d is actually kind of interesting when you think about the effects. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re building a house: you can get the flooring guys in and out within a day (maybe). Scale that project to a hotel though, now your flooring guys can only complete several units in a day. This constraint to select spaces is what I mean.\n\nFlooring might be a dependancy of walls though. And roofing might depend on walls. So you end up with task dependancies, and on a resource-constrained schedule that has an effect of causing all tasks to sort of cascade to completion throughout the project.\n\nThis produces a natural grouping of spaces. Spaces can now be grouped based on where tasks will be completed. For example, if spaces 1, 2, and 3 get flooring done on day 1, spaces 1, 2, and 3 would be a grouping. Similarly, space 4. 5, and 6 might get flooring done on day 2 while the wall guys are in spaces 1, 2, and 3. Spaces 4, 5, and 6 would be another grouping.\n\nOne advantageous effect of these groupings is that a manager can reassign a not-on-schedule space to a different group\u2026 a group performing tasks which are more downstream\u2026 in order to put that space back on-schedule. Though this has the adverse effect of making the new grouping\u2019s workload larger for the remaining duration of the project. Also, this kind of adjustment would be impossible for any spaces in the most downstream grouping.\n\nTypically, there\u2019s a project level set of tasks that all spaces inherit. This is good for easing the schedule creation process but might not precisely represent the reality of the project.\n\nTypically, this is managed via an Excel spreadsheet where tasks are laid out as column headers, space groupings as indices, and expected start dates as matrix values. The space groupings are just CSV formatted text of the spaces contained, making recognition easy. Cell formatting is used to indicate completion of a task within a space grouping. This encoding for status is unfortunate because if status between spaces within a group are desynchronized, say because one space is late, there is no good way to represent that on the schedule.\n\nOne benefit the guys using this thing don\u2019t want to give up is the ease of status changes though. They can open the Excel file, highlight the necessary cells, and accurately update the status for hundreds of spaces in a given second, forgoing any desynchronized spaces within their groups.\n\nWhatever the solution, they want better reporting into the overall state of completion and tardiness for all spaces, groupings, and tasks. They also want the data recorded for analysis of historical trends.\n\nSo Im mining these details for design requirements, like how spaces can elegantly swap between groups in order to be put \u201cback on-schedule.\u201d That would suggest that spaces are assigned tasks but not due dates for those tasks. Rather, spaces inherit their task due dates from the space grouping they\u2019re assigned to.\n\nAnyhow, I believe I can build the necessary backend logic, such as the application database. Perhaps even some basic forms to input data, as well as dashboards. As I\u2019m going through this though, the scheduling aspect feels like I\u2019m reinventing the wheel a bit. Secondly, I worry that a complex frontend will need to be built and that is not my expertise.\n\nI\u2019ve tested various less data-engineering solutions like MS Project, figuring those should be good enough. They\u2019re not good enough for various reasons but mostly because none are designed to manage thousands of tasks, spaces, etc. in elegant ways.
