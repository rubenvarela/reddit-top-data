I recently went on a little journey to find a budget VPS, talking like real budget, 256MB RAM + 1 vCPU for $0.275/mo? Could be cheaper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently came across a host called Electrohaxz, name's a little funny and I thought they had no history and were recent, but I came across this post  [(15) experience with https://electrohaxz.host/vco : VPS (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPS/comments/urx1lp/experience_with_httpselectrohaxzhostvco/) with a small Google search. They offer budget VPS, dedicated servers and a virtual colocation program.  \n\nI thought it was too good to be true, virtually colocate your device in their network to receive a VPS back? Count me in! And so, I decided to sacrifice an old Asus T101HA I had laying around with 4GB of RAM and a nasty Intel Atom in trade for 7 cores of \"ELECTROHAXZ Hosting 3.8GHz CPU\" and 7GB of RAM. Access was possible using VNC or a SPICE connection. Setup was made by joining the hosting provider's Discord server with a decoy account and he DM'ed me steps to liveboot Peppermint and deploy his customized Debian image from there. I opened a few ports on my router directed towards that device. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found a lot of the stuff there sketchy, such as, the CPU in instance, is advertised as a 3.8GHz CPU, but marked 2.00GHz in the BIOS. All traffic would also be routed through his network and I'd have to request for ports to be open, and an explanation to why they were being opened. He also denied opening SSH in general. The ports that were opened, instead of being 1:1, were stuck behind NAT-alike configuration, such as, port 2022 was being shoved towards 11801, etc etc. Even though he stated that the servers had a dedicated IPv4 to them.  After some time, my device started randomly crashing and I thought that maybe this isn't the best way to put it down, so I requested for the colocation to be terminated so I could transfer it to a more disposable device. I also took an additional peek at his website and found \"Dedicated Servers\". Which were cheap devices like a Google Chromebox or the iView i700QW running Windows or Debian in them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to request for a trial of the devices mentioned above. The iView i700QW had instant deployment on Ubuntu 23.04 and I had to wait a few hours for the Google Chromebox, but he deployed it in Windows for me, which is something I requested and really looked forward to testing out. They perform as expected, hosted in Phoenix, USA, and they're connected to his \"ServerRoom\" 5GHz networks. Fair and usable, wlan isn't the best, but again, these start at $1/mo and extend up to $6. So I shouldn't complain. It seems like he purchases these devices for cheap on eBay and sets them up as \"servers\" to be resold.

He should've left it alone by now, right? I started to wander around the device to identify the model, CPU clock, and just overall system information. I checked the DHCP server, went on it using the browser, looked at the wi-fis around, and more. And suddenly, while I was asking about the device, the owner bombed me with this message:  \n\n&gt;Additionally, we must inform you that any further attempts to access our administrative networks will result in a permanent ban from using our services in any location. You are only permitted to switch between preauthorized networks. Please read our terms of service at https://electrohaxz.host/tos \n\nGreat, how do you know I did that? It's normal for a few apps to contact the DHCP server. I went to look at the displays available and noticed that the dedicated server was connected to \"Mi TV\", and then damn, this dude's definitely watching me. I downloaded Minecraft on it, ran around a little, 1.8.9 was NASTY, but this is a dual-core 1.6GHz config, I shouldn't complain for $4/mo.

The connection was terminated, and he shot me with a: \n\n&gt;However unfortunately at this time your dedicated server has been automatically terminated due to malicious or prohibited network traffic.

Therefore, no network traffic was issued because it wasn't possible for network traffic to ever be issued. Contacted their servers? Sure, but they're behind Cloudflare, so it'd look like contacting Cloudflare servers, wouldn't it? I'd question him, but he blocked me right after this, so I couldn't milk any explanation out of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis dude was either watching me close-by or he's got some fancy networking viewing tools that are able to predict what I'm about to do. I'm asking for your opinion now, are all of these actions justifiable? Am I being paranoid about being watched or is this actually sketchy activity?

I recently went on a little journey to find a budget VPS, talking like real budget, 256MB RAM + 1 vCPU for $0.275/mo? Could be cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a host called Electrohaxz, name&amp;#39;s a little funny and I thought they had no history and were recent, but I came across this post  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VPS/comments/urx1lp/experience_with_httpselectrohaxzhostvco/\"&gt;(15) experience with https://electrohaxz.host/vco : VPS (reddit.com)&lt;/a&gt; with a small Google search. They offer budget VPS, dedicated servers and a virtual colocation program.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought it was too good to be true, virtually colocate your device in their network to receive a VPS back? Count me in! And so, I decided to sacrifice an old Asus T101HA I had laying around with 4GB of RAM and a nasty Intel Atom in trade for 7 cores of &amp;quot;ELECTROHAXZ Hosting 3.8GHz CPU&amp;quot; and 7GB of RAM. Access was possible using VNC or a SPICE connection. Setup was made by joining the hosting provider&amp;#39;s Discord server with a decoy account and he DM&amp;#39;ed me steps to liveboot Peppermint and deploy his customized Debian image from there. I opened a few ports on my router directed towards that device. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a lot of the stuff there sketchy, such as, the CPU in instance, is advertised as a 3.8GHz CPU, but marked 2.00GHz in the BIOS. All traffic would also be routed through his network and I&amp;#39;d have to request for ports to be open, and an explanation to why they were being opened. He also denied opening SSH in general. The ports that were opened, instead of being 1:1, were stuck behind NAT-alike configuration, such as, port 2022 was being shoved towards 11801, etc etc. Even though he stated that the servers had a dedicated IPv4 to them.  After some time, my device started randomly crashing and I thought that maybe this isn&amp;#39;t the best way to put it down, so I requested for the colocation to be terminated so I could transfer it to a more disposable device. I also took an additional peek at his website and found &amp;quot;Dedicated Servers&amp;quot;. Which were cheap devices like a Google Chromebox or the iView i700QW running Windows or Debian in them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to request for a trial of the devices mentioned above. The iView i700QW had instant deployment on Ubuntu 23.04 and I had to wait a few hours for the Google Chromebox, but he deployed it in Windows for me, which is something I requested and really looked forward to testing out. They perform as expected, hosted in Phoenix, USA, and they&amp;#39;re connected to his &amp;quot;ServerRoom&amp;quot; 5GHz networks. Fair and usable, wlan isn&amp;#39;t the best, but again, these start at $1/mo and extend up to $6. So I shouldn&amp;#39;t complain. It seems like he purchases these devices for cheap on eBay and sets them up as &amp;quot;servers&amp;quot; to be resold.  Up until now, his practices are justifiable and I can totally understand if a host wants to shove traffic under NAT even if the server has it&amp;#39;s own IP for safety reasons. But it&amp;#39;s on the Google Chromebox that things start to take a weird turn to the shady side.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He deployed it for me, we had a hard time setting up Parsec for connectivity and he typed the credentials for me on the device, there and done.

With Nagios LS and EdgeRouter, thanks to a dashboard adapted from &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/dominikborkowski/nagioslogserver-netfilter\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, I have the possibility to look into the firewall logs and find erratic traffic (and other nifty things).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See here for a redacted example: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/9nzHXlf\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/9nzHXlf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/32WWvmzXAEWWLiLnLrvzMQYBgPd_ueWOsY68qCXW-mM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=06b8a90364183049217f5487a34ed0364aa45454", "width": 1907, "height": 1947}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/32WWvmzXAEWWLiLnLrvzMQYBgPd_ueWOsY68qCXW-mM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f5d5461722be894481dd636e64da522fb68710", "width": 108, "height": 110}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/32WWvmzXAEWWLiLnLrvzMQYBgPd_ueWOsY68qCXW-mM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e96f1ae77a99d6ec11fe80b057a40b6c92f6784c", "width": 216, "height": 220}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/32WWvmzXAEWWLiLnLrvzMQYBgPd_ueWOsY68qCXW-mM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9706b6edd8dfbe5b2d50eb0dc0df346832a3a218", "width": 320, "height": 326}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/32WWvmzXAEWWLiLnLrvzMQYBgPd_ueWOsY68qCXW-mM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f784ba14f76cc28905f8493a063347cddf3028ad", "width": 640, "height": 653}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/32WWvmzXAEWWLiLnLrvzMQYBgPd_ueWOsY68qCXW-mM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e18e30d0c655deb0963fb67f10e05100edb7670b", "width": 960, "height": 980}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/32WWvmzXAEWWLiLnLrvzMQYBgPd_ueWOsY68qCXW-mM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43480f093a99c0952145980804739c0c4079dfe8", "width": 1080, "height": 1102}], "variants": {}, "id": "MXdJ-A18euA1WWNgzzashV90VBOsYOj-dxFHjlZ9rtY"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1az28nh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KatalRed", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/1az28nh/alternatives_to_nagios_ls_log_server/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1az28nh/alternatives_to_nagios_ls_log_server/", "subreddit_subscribers": 324557, "created_utc": 1708800977.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "I just downloaded photosync pro and it works great.

Azuracast did not seem to have exactly what I am looking for (radio voiceover hosts, live control board for song selection/pause and sound effect soundboard)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-remote connect to machine with minimal software running on client machine(s)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-pick and change songs at any moment, or disable the music altogether at any time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-audio filter the entire stream&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-have voice over from 2 different radio station hosts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-play soundboard sound effects&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would like a way to have live &amp;quot;callers&amp;quot; on the show as well. Maybe just via a discord call? I am mildly experienced using debian-based OSes but I&amp;#39;m starting to thing I am going to be looking at running a Windows VM for my purposes. I would prefer a nice web UI that the radio hosts can connect to, but I don&amp;#39;t know of anything that would suit those purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any self hosted server options that would fit these needs already? or do I basically need to make a windows box for radio hosts to remote into? Thanks, any help is appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1azrd6b", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "itachipirate2", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/1azrd6b/remote_microphone_audio_streaming_setup/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1azrd6b/remote_microphone_audio_streaming_setup/", "subreddit_subscribers": 324557, "created_utc": 1708877015.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_15wsj82q", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Raspberry Pi Self-Hosting Experiments", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "blogging", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1az8njf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Blogging Platform", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "default", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "created": 1708816876.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "mbrizic.com", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://mbrizic.com/blog/raspberry-self-hosting/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "fd71269e-7e67-11e9-8d1a-0e844b9a0afc", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1az8njf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mbrizic", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/1az8njf/raspberry_pi_selfhosting_experiments/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://mbrizic.com/blog/raspberry-self-hosting/", "subreddit_subscribers": 324557, "created_utc": 1708816876.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI\u2019m opening a small car/scooter rental business.
