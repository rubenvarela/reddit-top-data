I have also done database design and app development this is all wrapped up in the title &amp;quot;Consultant&amp;quot;. I have certifications in Power BI Associate, Azure Data Fundamentals, and Databricks Fundaments. I have manufacturing management experience and a technician background, as well. I also like to dabble in UX/UI events. I have an undergrad in BS Organizational Leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel that I would like to become a data architect, Senior Data Engineer, or digital transformation type work. To obtain these roles, I feel that my non-STEM degree will hold me back and would like to get a Masters, among other reasons. I am very fortunate to be in a position where money is not an issue with respect to college tuition.  I feel my calling is to go to the next level within the field.
