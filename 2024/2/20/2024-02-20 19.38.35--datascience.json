I didn't feel like  I was doing anything of substance.\n\nI've  always enjoyed working with data and numbers, originally it was with  data visualization and writing funky Excel formulas, but I knew that I  had to learn to code if I wanted to make this a reality. After great  support and various presentations to my current boss, he (PhD  Engineering) decided to hire me as a full-time Data Scientist, from the  Project Manager role I had before.\n\nHe  knows that I am not the most technical, I'm even embarrassed and shy  away from using the title to describe myself. But he has always  commended my ability to learn, my enthusiasm, and ability to grasp  technical concepts and distill them for business/non-technical folks. I  see this advantage in myself as well, not to mention whatever domain  expertise the Commerce degree brings.\n\nFast  forward a year, I have been fortunate enough to work on some cool  projects, particularly in NLP. I sadly do not feel the same enthusiasm  and rush to learn as I did once, but I feel way more comfortable with  coding. I would still say I have a lot to learn on the technicals, but  from what I understand, most people in DS feel this way.\n\nLayoffs  are getting a bit too close now, and I have been applying viciously -  for DS and DA roles alike. I know I'll be at a disadvantage for DS given  I only have a Bachelor, not to mention it is non-technical. I've even  had someone tell me when I mention my degree, that they \"only hire  engineers\", and \"even their UX designer has a Chemical Enginering  Masters\" (weird flex but ok)\n\nI  guess the point of this post is to see whether I can continue in DS. I  have now a year of experience as a Data Scientist, but I honestly don't  know if I feel worth that. I feel like a data analyst that can code,  with an interest in ML and DL. I don't know if people would even look at  my resume and consider hiring me for DS, or just laugh me out the door.\n\nNot to mention my DS salary is inflated compared to DA roles, which makes my job hunt really tough.\n\nI'm  not sure what to do; I've been told to take a pay cut if I get a role,  or to go back to school for a technical masters, or to still focus only  on DS.\n\nHonestly, I just want to  figure out what I'm worth with one year of DS experience and a  non-technical Bachelors. At this point, I'm just applying to both types  of roles, and seeing what sticks. It would suck to go for a DA role and  lose the ML elements of my work now (feels like a downgrade), but at the  same time, I have no idea if I can continue in this position at a new  company.\n\nTLDR: Joined as a Finance  major, hated working in Finance, with support of an incredible team,  hired as a Data Scientist a year ago. Layoffs season is around the  corner and I'm applying, but not sure if my background will actually get  me anything in DS field.

I didn&amp;#39;t feel like  I was doing anything of substance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve  always enjoyed working with data and numbers, originally it was with  data visualization and writing funky Excel formulas, but I knew that I  had to learn to code if I wanted to make this a reality. After great  support and various presentations to my current boss, he (PhD  Engineering) decided to hire me as a full-time Data Scientist, from the  Project Manager role I had before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He  knows that I am not the most technical, I&amp;#39;m even embarrassed and shy  away from using the title to describe myself. But he has always  commended my ability to learn, my enthusiasm, and ability to grasp  technical concepts and distill them for business/non-technical folks. I  see this advantage in myself as well, not to mention whatever domain  expertise the Commerce degree brings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast  forward a year, I have been fortunate enough to work on some cool  projects, particularly in NLP. I sadly do not feel the same enthusiasm  and rush to learn as I did once, but I feel way more comfortable with  coding. I would still say I have a lot to learn on the technicals, but  from what I understand, most people in DS feel this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Layoffs  are getting a bit too close now, and I have been applying viciously -  for DS and DA roles alike. I know I&amp;#39;ll be at a disadvantage for DS given  I only have a Bachelor, not to mention it is non-technical. I&amp;#39;ve even  had someone tell me when I mention my degree, that they &amp;quot;only hire  engineers&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;even their UX designer has a Chemical Enginering  Masters&amp;quot; (weird flex but ok)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  guess the point of this post is to see whether I can continue in DS. I  have now a year of experience as a Data Scientist, but I honestly don&amp;#39;t  know if I feel worth that. I feel like a data analyst that can code,  with an interest in ML and DL. I don&amp;#39;t know if people would even look at  my resume and consider hiring me for DS, or just laugh me out the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention my DS salary is inflated compared to DA roles, which makes my job hunt really tough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m  not sure what to do; I&amp;#39;ve been told to take a pay cut if I get a role,  or to go back to school for a technical masters, or to still focus only  on DS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just want to  figure out what I&amp;#39;m worth with one year of DS experience and a  non-technical Bachelors. At this point, I&amp;#39;m just applying to both types  of roles, and seeing what sticks. It would suck to go for a DA role and  lose the ML elements of my work now (feels like a downgrade), but at the  same time, I have no idea if I can continue in this position at a new  company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Joined as a Finance  major, hated working in Finance, with support of an incredible team,  hired as a Data Scientist a year ago.
