The scope involves producing some preliminary assessment of the company\u2019s past operating state of risk and applying that to a set of thresholds dictated by the board and executive team. This requires 3-5 years minimum of historic data, but your company only put a \u201cdata warehouse\u201d in place in 2021. Additionally they want a detailed set of dashboards to present their risk levels in each category for managing decision purposes (I.e. board and execs peruse the dashboards and make decisions on high level strategy occasionally. Line managers look more frequently to understand trends in their respective areas of control and make tactical changes). It is expected you are to build models to assist in forecasting these data points for said categories. There are more than 2 dozen individual areas for which you need production models, data, and some way to present the output to non technical end users so they can make decisions with the information/predictions. \n\nFinally, the origin of the categories is from an executives back pocket scraped from a previous org that is no less than 1 order of magnitude larger than the current company. Regulators have yet to require this for your company, but after several misses in terms of financial, staffing turnover, and repetitional risk, the board has decided they will start this process despite limited resources to accomplish it. \n\nYou are constrained by headcount, tooling, and data. \n\nAs mentioned, your warehouse is young. Add to that, no resource exists to administer the database and server, no resource exists to administer non existent cloud resources, no resource exists to provide data engineering services to extend the warehouses breadth of data. The warehouse was configured by a vendor and purges data after 90 days after consolidating to monthly snapshots. Then after a year down to year end snap shots. \n\nYour toolset is officially power bi, and that is being questioned as a necessary expense. Simultaneously the CTO keeps spouting about how they\u2019ll build a BI engineering team, yet they got the org into this technical wasteland in the first place. Unofficially you have assembled a rickety framework on AWS to run modes on batch schedules that is far from robust and production grade architecture. You made friends with an outgoing sys admin and got VSCode and Python and local admin, as well as SSMS and admin rights to said warehouse before they left so you could do work. You also have excel\u2026 AWS is not an official org vendor and no due diligence was done considering the $5/mo cost to run a single regression model as a proof of concept. You\u2019ve been avoiding doing the paperwork because the opportunity cost is too high and the AWS account rep assigned to you won\u2019t answer your calls and emails because your account is a joke to them.\n\nYour team is you and a part time intern. \n\nYour budget is $100/month plus a $5k limit on a corp card after the real estate agent director over AI and mobile app vendor managers convinced the org they didn\u2019t need to pay for a $1800/mo data broker that was in your budget. That $100/mo is also shadow funded because you made friends with the accounting manager and AP team who oversees Corp card and budget overages and got them to look the other way. \n\nYou cannot quit because you have nothing else lined up.\n\nYour domestic and romantic partner hasn\u2019t worked in a year because market is shit. You\u2019re the sole breadwinner.

The scope involves producing some preliminary assessment of the company\u2019s past operating state of risk and applying that to a set of thresholds dictated by the board and executive team. This requires 3-5 years minimum of historic data, but your company only put a \u201cdata warehouse\u201d in place in 2021. Additionally they want a detailed set of dashboards to present their risk levels in each category for managing decision purposes (I.e. board and execs peruse the dashboards and make decisions on high level strategy occasionally. Line managers look more frequently to understand trends in their respective areas of control and make tactical changes). It is expected you are to build models to assist in forecasting these data points for said categories. There are more than 2 dozen individual areas for which you need production models, data, and some way to present the output to non technical end users so they can make decisions with the information/predictions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the origin of the categories is from an executives back pocket scraped from a previous org that is no less than 1 order of magnitude larger than the current company. Regulators have yet to require this for your company, but after several misses in terms of financial, staffing turnover, and repetitional risk, the board has decided they will start this process despite limited resources to accomplish it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are constrained by headcount, tooling, and data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, your warehouse is young. Add to that, no resource exists to administer the database and server, no resource exists to administer non existent cloud resources, no resource exists to provide data engineering services to extend the warehouses breadth of data. The warehouse was configured by a vendor and purges data after 90 days after consolidating to monthly snapshots. Then after a year down to year end snap shots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your toolset is officially power bi, and that is being questioned as a necessary expense. Simultaneously the CTO keeps spouting about how they\u2019ll build a BI engineering team, yet they got the org into this technical wasteland in the first place. Unofficially you have assembled a rickety framework on AWS to run modes on batch schedules that is far from robust and production grade architecture. You made friends with an outgoing sys admin and got VSCode and Python and local admin, as well as SSMS and admin rights to said warehouse before they left so you could do work. You also have excel\u2026 AWS is not an official org vendor and no due diligence was done considering the $5/mo cost to run a single regression model as a proof of concept. You\u2019ve been avoiding doing the paperwork because the opportunity cost is too high and the AWS account rep assigned to you won\u2019t answer your calls and emails because your account is a joke to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your team is you and a part time intern. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your budget is $100/month plus a $5k limit on a corp card after the real estate agent director over AI and mobile app vendor managers convinced the org they didn\u2019t need to pay for a $1800/mo data broker that was in your budget. That $100/mo is also shadow funded because you made friends with the accounting manager and AP team who oversees Corp card and budget overages and got them to look the other way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot quit because you have nothing else lined up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your domestic and romantic partner hasn\u2019t worked in a year because market is shit.
