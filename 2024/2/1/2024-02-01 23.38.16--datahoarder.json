I volunteered to download all the data and the moderators liked the idea and made me a moderator also. People love the idea and want me to do it. I love saving history, especially local stuff.

Price-point: $1500 CAD for the enclosure. \n\nHey all,\n\nI\u2019m currently building a NAS for my workplace off of which we plan to do video editing.\n\nOur requirements are 4-6 bays (we have the drives delivered already), Thunderbolt 3/4 (to edit vids directly from our Mac on Final Cut), 1-2 M.2 NVME slots (cacheing for editing), a 2.5 or 10 GbE Ethernet port (to slurp projects locally from elsewhere on the property or from home during remote days), and RAID 6 support for 5 drive or more, or RAID 5 for 4 drives. \n\nIf we had to give up features, we could probably first give up the M.2 support (we can transfer projects to machines and work on them locally), second, give up 2.5/10GbE (these speeds are for further proofing when we eventually upgrade the local network), and, third, give up the Ethernet port altogether (this would just mean more planning and coordination for us, but is still workable).\n\nWe planned to purchase the QNAP TS-453BT3, load it with 4 x 22TB Exos drives, and a couple of 4TB NVME\u2019s, but it\u2019s not really in stock anywhere anymore. We found this for $1500, so that is our expected budget for the enclosure. \n\nOur second option was the TS-464T4, but it never made it to production with Thunderbolt.\n\nThird option might be the Terra Master D5 Thunderbolt 3, but it has no NVME or Ethernet support, so is an absolute last option, and it doesn\u2019t have the best reviews.\n\nAnother option we found was the ZimaCube, which looks like a perfect fit, but we need it sooner than later, and it looks like the Kickatarter hasn\u2019t finished, and we need a concrete delivery date so we can plan what to do in the meantime.\n\nI\u2019ve currently spent 2 days trying to source this on my own.\n\nWe could build a system, but Thunderbolt cards are tough to come by and require specialty motherboards. And then we have to find an OS that supports all the hardware (TrueNAS/FreeNAS or Unraid?), and, while I can poke around at hardware compatibility, configuring the hardware on an unfamiliar OS is outside of my wheelhouse (not an IT guy, just the best in the company).\n\nIf we have our IT contractor build the system, they will charge a dumb amount compared to what we can build in-house, and while that would be worthwhile, convincing the higher-ups who are traditionally blue-collars will likely not go well.\n\nThe one solution would be to spend the $3-5k on a better enclosure, transition our SharePoint over to the NAS and use the savings on SharePoint Licenses ($17/mth/user; we have around 20 users) to pay for the additional expense, but configuring permissions and remote access is also beyond me, and my colleague pointed out that our SharePoint licenses are probably bundled in with our MS365 licenses (Office suite, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.) so that may not be as simple. We are also working off a rural internet connection that has occasion to go down, so reliability would also be an issue. Losing access for one or two editors is NBD, but losing it for the company would be a bit of a deal. \n\nThanks for any guidance you have. :)", "author_fullname": "t2_71zkpe0z", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Thunderbolt NAS Recommendations", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeNAS", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1agib0j", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1706813241.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.HomeNAS", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Looking for 4/5/6-bay Thunderbolt 3/4 NAS with Ethernet, M.2 caching and RAID 5/6 support.
