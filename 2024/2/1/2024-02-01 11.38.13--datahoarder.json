I've been reading a lot for the past two weeks, but I'm still struggling to gain a deeper understanding of how to set up and configure the system I want to build. Please be kind \ud83d\ude05\n\nUntil now, I've connected my 4TB USB 3.0 WD Elements external HDD to my router to access and watch movies/shows on my TV and Tablet.\n\nI'm moving to a bigger place soon and plan to upgrade to a larger, dedicated NAS, ideally used as a media server. From what I understand, a NAS and a media server are not *exactly* the same things?\nMy primary goal is to watch 4k UHD HDR content with the new setup, but I also want some storage space. However, my current setup of an HDD plugged into a router (now obviously to me) struggles with watching 4k. Nevertheless, I'd still like to pursue it for my future setup.\n\nI've come across information about real-time hardware transcoding and software transcoding. This is where I struggle to find and comprehend the information. As I understand it now, I would need a NAS configured as a media server, and for real-time hardware transcoding, it would essentially be a mini-computer specifically equipped for transcoding \u2013 is that right?\n\nAt this point, it's probably obvious I still have a lot to learn, and my main question is whether any of you know of a good guide or article on how to set all this up. I especially struggle to understand the software aspect. Are there dedicated OS for media servers? Do they cost something? Would I need a RAID setup if I only save non-important data on my NAS? Does transcoding reduce image quality, or is it solely necessary for the end-user to be able to play the file?\n\nI appreciate any input you guys can provide, and especially any deeper insights you can point me towards!

Please be kind \ud83d\ude05&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until now, I&amp;#39;ve connected my 4TB USB 3.0 WD Elements external HDD to my router to access and watch movies/shows on my TV and Tablet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m moving to a bigger place soon and plan to upgrade to a larger, dedicated NAS, ideally used as a media server. From what I understand, a NAS and a media server are not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same things?\nMy primary goal is to watch 4k UHD HDR content with the new setup, but I also want some storage space. However, my current setup of an HDD plugged into a router (now obviously to me) struggles with watching 4k. Nevertheless, I&amp;#39;d still like to pursue it for my future setup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come across information about real-time hardware transcoding and software transcoding. This is where I struggle to find and comprehend the information. As I understand it now, I would need a NAS configured as a media server, and for real-time hardware transcoding, it would essentially be a mini-computer specifically equipped for transcoding \u2013 is that right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it&amp;#39;s probably obvious I still have a lot to learn, and my main question is whether any of you know of a good guide or article on how to set all this up. I especially struggle to understand the software aspect. Are there dedicated OS for media servers? Do they cost something? Would I need a RAID setup if I only save non-important data on my NAS? Does transcoding reduce image quality, or is it solely necessary for the end-user to be able to play the file?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate any input you guys can provide, and especially any deeper insights you can point me towards!

I am currently planning a back up plan for my personal device. For my main computer, I have 5TB (really 4.55TB) of storage, in which I am currently using 2.1TB in saved documents, photos, video, music, games and program files. My plan for my physical backup of my PC is to use a\u00a0SABRENT USB 3.0 to SATA I/II/III Dual Bay External Hard Drive Docking Station and purchase a internal Hard drive to clone my current storage. I plan on disconnecting the drive from the dock and storing in my house safe or at my parents house. They are close so I could back it up monthly, or twice a year. Besides sedimental value and memories, nothing is really work related/mission critical so I do not believe that need the cost or labor of configuring a RAID or NAS set up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0What I am currently struggling is for an online cloud based storage solution.

I currently have a collection of about 10 external 2.5\" HDDs of 5TB each. I want to consolidate this mess of drives into a neat NAS of 4x18TB. The basis for this system will be my former office PC, a DeskMini A300 with a Ryzen 3400G, which is more than capable of running a Debian server with a number of Docker containers, TrueNAS, maybe a small Minecraft server, and all of that over Proxmox. \n\nOne issue remains: The mini PC only has 2 SATA ports (which are already taken up by two SSDs) and doesn't have a PSU, but runs over a power brick. My options, as per my research over the last few days, are as follows: \n\n1. Buy a [SATA-to-USB docking station](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07H11KXCL): Cheap enough, only takes one USB port, but have heard from multiple sources that it's a really bad idea to run RAID on external docking stations (connection issues with the USB port / cable / controller / whatever, most of them cheap, might wreck the entire array -- is that true?)\n2. Buy an [M.2 to SATA adapter](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFBjbjJmelUxVXN4RUVQT1BxbmtzMzdYUEtyUXxBQ3Jtc0tuVnhEUVhrZnVfUDdxNnlaYS1qbDVmcjRZNEpyQzhkOE1yOThEV3BTdGVmOVE5U2xtSUE0NkZrOURIdWRsWTdpZnZrSHVlUHFPRFdkR29JbEpRTnJEMVQtTEZ3R1k4VVBNSFFpclY5ZllwTEEwMmhEQQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005005669800665.html&amp;v=vjDoQA4C22c) to connect the drives and solder together a DIY external power supply (maybe DC power brick --&gt; molex --&gt; SATA power?) but I have never soldered any electronics in my life and would like to avoid practicing on 1000\u20ac+ hardware unless there's a REALLY good tutorial. Would probably put them in an [external HDD cage](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003146832324.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2deu) with a fan for aesthetics\n3. Bite the bullet, sell my DeskMini for like 200\u20ac and build a completely new system which won't have any of these constraints. Downside is that most prebuilt NASes have the shittiest of hardware, so if I want anything better, say an i3 over a Celeron, it's back to clunky DIY. Plus way more expensive. \n\nAre there other options or guides out there? Am I missing something?

I currently have a collection of about 10 external 2.5&amp;quot; HDDs of 5TB each. I want to consolidate this mess of drives into a neat NAS of 4x18TB. The basis for this system will be my former office PC, a DeskMini A300 with a Ryzen 3400G, which is more than capable of running a Debian server with a number of Docker containers, TrueNAS, maybe a small Minecraft server, and all of that over Proxmox. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One issue remains: The mini PC only has 2 SATA ports (which are already taken up by two SSDs) and doesn&amp;#39;t have a PSU, but runs over a power brick. My options, as per my research over the last few days, are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07H11KXCL\"&gt;SATA-to-USB docking station&lt;/a&gt;: Cheap enough, only takes one USB port, but have heard from multiple sources that it&amp;#39;s a really bad idea to run RAID on external docking stations (connection issues with the USB port / cable / controller / whatever, most of them cheap, might wreck the entire array -- is that true?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy an &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFBjbjJmelUxVXN4RUVQT1BxbmtzMzdYUEtyUXxBQ3Jtc0tuVnhEUVhrZnVfUDdxNnlaYS1qbDVmcjRZNEpyQzhkOE1yOThEV3BTdGVmOVE5U2xtSUE0NkZrOURIdWRsWTdpZnZrSHVlUHFPRFdkR29JbEpRTnJEMVQtTEZ3R1k4VVBNSFFpclY5ZllwTEEwMmhEQQ&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005005669800665.html&amp;amp;v=vjDoQA4C22c\"&gt;M.2 to SATA adapter&lt;/a&gt; to connect the drives and solder together a DIY external power supply (maybe DC power brick --&amp;gt; molex --&amp;gt; SATA power?) but I have never soldered any electronics in my life and would like to avoid practicing on 1000\u20ac+ hardware unless there&amp;#39;s a REALLY good tutorial. Would probably put them in an &lt;a href=\"https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003146832324.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2deu\"&gt;external HDD cage&lt;/a&gt; with a fan for aesthetics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bite the bullet, sell my DeskMini for like 200\u20ac and build a completely new system which won&amp;#39;t have any of these constraints.
