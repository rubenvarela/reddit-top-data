However rather than giving me a computer and a dataset, he asks me to speak code to him. He asks some questions like:\n\n\"What function should i use to read Excel file?\"\n\n\"What function should i use to partition data for datascience?\"\n\n\"What function should i use to clean the data?\" (Like it depends on the data and what you wanna do?!)\n\nBasically just following a generic DS notebook methodology for building a model. He then gets me to **spell out** my answer verbally to him, while he types it.\n\nNow i obviously know how to partition data for cross-validation - i just often confuse function names because i work in both R and Python currently, and at work i use a custom code library our team built in R. \n\nObviously irl if im ever unsure of which function to use i check existing code base or skl documentation, but in this situation i dont think i gave a lot of 'correct' answers - and im worried i have the impression i dont know how to code just because i code differently to him.\n\nWhen i talk about my methodology i usually focus on explaining the steps i would go through, rather than the literal code. Ive never done an assessment like this before - so my questions are:\n\n- is this a precedented assessment technique, or was this just someone who couldnt be bothered preparing a more conventional skills assesment?\n- is 'verbal coding' a skill that is worth practicing/rehearsing?\n- how could i do better next time?

However rather than giving me a computer and a dataset, he asks me to speak code to him. He asks some questions like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What function should i use to read Excel file?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What function should i use to partition data for datascience?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What function should i use to clean the data?&amp;quot; (Like it depends on the data and what you wanna do?!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically just following a generic DS notebook methodology for building a model. He then gets me to &lt;strong&gt;spell out&lt;/strong&gt; my answer verbally to him, while he types it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now i obviously know how to partition data for cross-validation - i just often confuse function names because i work in both R and Python currently, and at work i use a custom code library our team built in R. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously irl if im ever unsure of which function to use i check existing code base or skl documentation, but in this situation i dont think i gave a lot of &amp;#39;correct&amp;#39; answers - and im worried i have the impression i dont know how to code just because i code differently to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i talk about my methodology i usually focus on explaining the steps i would go through, rather than the literal code. Ive never done an assessment like this before - so my questions are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;is this a precedented assessment technique, or was this just someone who couldnt be bothered preparing a more conventional skills assesment?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;is &amp;#39;verbal coding&amp;#39; a skill that is worth practicing/rehearsing?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how could i do better next time?
