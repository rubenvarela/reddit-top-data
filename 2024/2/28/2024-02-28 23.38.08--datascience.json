My experience spans almost two years as an NLP research scientist at a medical research institute. Recently, I've taken a significant turn in my career path. In December, I returned to my homeland, a charming yet technologically nascent French island, to continue my data science journey. The tech scene here seems to lag by about 5-8 years compared to major hubs like Paris, predominantly in data maturity levels. Local companies are just beginning to recognize the value of data, mainly focusing on data engineering to organize and store their data effectively. The biggest insutries here are tourism, mass-retail, civil engineering, agriculture, transports and medical.\n\nCurrently, I serve as the sole full-stack data scientist in an auditing and accounting firm, a role that encompasses both data engineering and analysis. My responsibilities include developing internal data solutions for auditing purposes and external solutions for our accounting services. The solutions primarily involve building databases linked to interactive dashboards, occasionally integrating forecasting models or leveraging large language models (LLMs) as needed.\n\nFor dashboard development, I utilize Plotly Dash, which facilitates both front-end and back-end development in Python, allowing for the creation of comprehensive web applications. These applications support user authentication and authorization, dashboard access control, and interaction with various analysis cycles. My work heavily involves PostgreSQL for database management, with a continuous effort to automate and optimize data processing. Currently, I'm exploring efficient methods to allow non-technical users to upload CSV files for automatic cleaning and integration into our databases, using PySpark for automation. The infrastructure is based on Linux servers, with Docker for containerization and Docker Swarm for container orchestration across different servers. Monitoring the state of our servers is an area I'm looking to improve, potentially through custom scripting or other recommended solutions.\n\nDespite my extensive experience in NLP research, my current role demands a broad set of skills, requiring me to quickly adapt and learn on the job. Given the company's size (about 100 employees) and the island's population (around 800,000), I've had to tailor my approach to fit our specific needs and limitations.\n\nI am curious about the community's thoughts on my current data science stack. I'm aware of more modern stacks involving technologies like Databricks, Looker, and Kubernetes.
