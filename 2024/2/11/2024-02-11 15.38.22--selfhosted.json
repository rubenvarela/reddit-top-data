everyone!\n\nI  have been a bit silent for the past 2 months, it was just the  sound of  me enjoying the holidays season, but I am back with a SOLID update!\n\nI  feel like it's been forever since I have written one of those, but here  we are! Cosmos comes back harder, faster, and stronger! This release  has been a tricky one. Not because it has a million new features, in  fact it does not have that many, but because it **fundamentally changes how Cosmos work**. Thanks those changes, your server will become **faster, more resilient, and easier to manage**. The three biggest changes are the migration to the \\`**host\\` network mode**, the **new puppet DB system**, and the **compatibility to docker-compose**. If you are wondering, the next version (0.15) will focus on **storage and disk management**!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oucjcp2mtyhc1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70b68a818e6148f94ad1640be08d24c6fc01df18\n\nAs a reminder, this exists alongside the existing features:\n\n* **App Store**  \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udcf1 To easily install and manage your  applications, with simple  installers, automatic updates and security  checks. This works alongside  manual installation methods, such as  importing docker-compose files,  or the docker CLI\n* **Customizable Homepage** \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\uddbc To access all your applications from a single place, with a beautiful and customizable UI\n* **Reverse-Proxy** \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udd17 Targeting containers, other servers, or serving static folders / SPA with **automatic HTTPS**, and a **nice UI**\n* **Authentication Server** \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69 With strong security, **multi-factor authentication** and multiple strategies (**OpenId**, forward headers, HTML)\n* **Container manager**  \ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udd27 To easily manage your  containers and their settings, keep them up  to date as well as audit  their security. Includes docker-compose  support!\n* **VPN** \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udd12 To securely access your applications from anywhere, without having to open ports on your router.\n* **Monitoring** \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcca Fully persisting and real-time monitoring with customizable alerts and notifications, so you can be notified of any issue.\n* **Identity Provider** \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69 To easily manage your users, **invite your friends and family**   to your applications without awkardly sharing credentials. Let them   request a password change with an email rather than having you unlock   their account manually!\n* **SmartShield technology**  \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udee1 Automatically secure  your applications without manual adjustments  (see below for more  details). Includes anti-bot and anti-DDOS  strategies.\n\n# Host mode\n\nThis  was a difficult decision but it had to be done: Cosmos will now  favor  the host network mode on the container. What that means in practice is  that Cosmos will share the host server's network controller instead of  using the Docker virtual one. This has **many**  advantages, and no disadvantages (to the user at least, but it was  tricky from a development perspective ;) ). The only downside is going  to be helping everyone migrate! Thankfully a wizard has been added to  Cosmos to help you with that. Note that if you are using Windows with  \"Docker for WSL\" you cannot use the host mode, it simply does not exist  there. Thanks to this mode:\n\n\\- You will be able to connect to other services using localhost\n\n\\- It is more performant\n\n\\-  You won't need all the cosmos-network anymore to connect to containers-  You can see all your server's networking data in the monitoring tab  (not just the docker data)\n\n\\- Docker-compose imported container will work out-of-the-box\n\n\\-  Remove the docker overhead (small performance gain) and ensure Docker  does not meddle with IP information- Faster boot time (no bootstrapping  of containers needed)\n\n# Puppet MongoDB\n\nDatabase  has been a subject of conversation for a while. The fact is, managing a  database is not easy and if it goes down, your server goes down. Well, **not anymore**!   Thanks to multiple changes: First of, credentials are not in the DB  anymore, so if the DB goes down, the UI is still reachable normally (so  you can administrate the DB container). Next, Cosmos is now able to  reconstruct the DB for you! Simply restart Cosmos and will repair  damaged DB containers. Those changes will hopefully make it easier for  everyone to maintain their server moving forward\n\n# Docker-compose compatibility\n\nIn  previous versions of Cosmos, if you imported a docker-compose into  Cosmos, not all of them work out of the box (ex. may be you need to link  containers together manually because Cosmos did not create a default  network). This won't be an issue anymore moving forward! Cosmos now  evolved to manage docker-compose file much close to the original  docker-compose behaviour, and they should just all work out of the box  as you would expect. Additionally, a new \"compose\" tab has been added to  container, to edit in compose form any container, including ones that  have not actually been created with compose files in the first place!  Finally, Cosmos features, such as adding routes directly in Compose,  and adding marketplace information has been added to docker-compose  files too!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The new compose tab to quickly manage your containers as compose files  \\(even your non-compose containers!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/28rsqyxmtyhc1.png?width=1502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd5ded37299168c6aced43e84e501704f77a17d2)\n\n# CasaOS and other marketplaces\n\nIn order to demonstrate the capability of this new release, I created [https://github.com/azukaar/cosmos-casaos-store](https://github.com/azukaar/cosmos-casaos-store)  Which is essentially the CasaOS appstore, fully integrated into Cosmos  with very little change (all automated). It shows how much more  compatible and flexible the docker-compose support has become, and  hopefuly will help develop further that side of the community with  custom markets.\n\n# Docker-compose vs Cosmos-Compose\n\nNot  a change per-say, but this release draws the difference better between  Docker-Compose and Cosmos-Compose, outlining why both of those tools are  important and complementary. While Docker-compose is more of a  \"installation script\", that bootstrap your containers, cosmos-compose is  a true 1 to 1 representation of your running containers, making it a  much more suitable tool for infra-as-code. This makes it a great choice  to manage, and quickly debug your containers in the newly added compose  tab.\n\n# A word about the full Docker-compose integration\n\nYou  may recall a video I posted not so long ago about full docker-integration (similar to what you would find in Portainer or  Dockge, where you can edit a container in the UI, and it edits the  actual docker-compose file in real time). While it is functional, it did  not make it to the release. The reason is because I am not happy with  the overall experience. Cosmos-compose brings so much quality-of-life  compared to docker-compose, the overall experience felt like a huge  downgrade\n\n* Cosmos-compose is much faster\n* It is also more accurate\n* When  something goes wrong, Cosmos-compose properly revert any broken  changes, while docker-compose keeps broken containers running after you  broke them\n* Cosmos-compose has multiple additional features such as post-install script that would be hard to re-implement in docker-compose\n\nAdditionally,  there were too many unanswered questions such as, what happens if you  try to edit a container that has a docker-compose, but said  docker-compose is missing invalid (aka. cannot be loaded because of a  syntax issue?) - then either you ignore the compose, making the feature  useless (the point was not to unsync the compose file) OR you block the  edit, making your container uneditable... not great. Also what about the  containers that are not even docker-compose based at all?\n\nFinally,  one of the last main reason, was that it is quite impossible to allow  both edition of the running container in the UI AND maintain support of  the .env file. Causing Cosmos to actually merge in the env var into the  docker-compose file (in comparison, Dockge does not care what the state  of the running container is, even if it unsync from the file - making  this a great tool to manage compose files (which is the intent), but not  so good to monitor and debug your containers). **Overall,  the degraded experience caused me to rethink my approach, and focus on  other changes, such as the compose tab and the improved compatibility.**\n\n# Other Changes\n\nThis  version has many smaller changes, especially to the marketplace, with  improved UI, additional options and guidance. Here's the full  changelogs:\n\n* Cosmos is now fully functional dockerless\n* Reworked Cosmos Compose for better compatibility with docker-compose.yml files\n* Added a \"compose\" tab to edit containers in text mode\n* Moved critical data (credentials and VPN) out of the database, to keep Cosmos online in case of incidents\n* Added an auto .zip backup mechanism\n* Added a syntax highlighter to the compose editor\n* New Database \"puppet\" mode that allows Cosmos to manage the database for you\n* Improved network IP resolution for containers, including supporting any network mode\n* Added support for markets and template directly with docker-compose.yml files\n* Add whitelist and constellation restriction options to the admin panel\n* Force low RAM usage on the MongoDB container (we don't need much!)\n* Removed all sort of container bootstrapping (much faster boot)\n* Added image clean up\n* Replaced network clean up by vanilla docker prune\n* Fix issue with removing IP whitelist\n* Add UI to create MCVlan networks\n* Add a log file in config folder for the selfupdater\n* Add a migration script to host mode\n* UI optimizations (thanks u/Kawanaao)\n* Add duplicate filter on store listing\n* Fixed an issue where container picker would select 'null' as container\n* Fix bug where Enabled checkbox was broken after a search\n* remove mac address when switching to host mode", "author_fullname": "t2_1p1hpmlp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\ud83c\udd95 Cosmos 0.14: Harder Better Faster Stronger!

Cosmos comes back harder, faster, and stronger! This release  has been a tricky one. Not because it has a million new features, in  fact it does not have that many, but because it &lt;strong&gt;fundamentally changes how Cosmos work&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks those changes, your server will become &lt;strong&gt;faster, more resilient, and easier to manage&lt;/strong&gt;. The three biggest changes are the migration to the `&lt;strong&gt;host` network mode&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;new puppet DB system&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;compatibility to docker-compose&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are wondering, the next version (0.15) will focus on &lt;strong&gt;storage and disk management&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oucjcp2mtyhc1.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=70b68a818e6148f94ad1640be08d24c6fc01df18\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/oucjcp2mtyhc1.png?width=1280&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=70b68a818e6148f94ad1640be08d24c6fc01df18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, this exists alongside the existing features:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Store&lt;/strong&gt;  \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udcf1 To easily install and manage your  applications, with simple  installers, automatic updates and security  checks.

What that means in practice is  that Cosmos will share the host server&amp;#39;s network controller instead of  using the Docker virtual one. This has &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt;  advantages, and no disadvantages (to the user at least, but it was  tricky from a development perspective ;) ).
