I took a lot away from the thread and i want to try again with a fresh take which incorporates the feedback and discussion from the last one. Let me know if you guys think this is closer to the mark and where you agree/disagree. \n\n**How might AI change Data Science?**\n\n* **AI tools need to work for Data Scientists first and foremost.** AI is not going to turn anyone into a Data Scientist magically overnight. Data professionals are ultimately the ones who will be analyzing the data and telling the story so the tools need to work for them. If the community and user base does not adopt a tool then it will never get traction. \n* **AI may provide productivity benefits for analysis but the data professional will still need to be in the driving seat.** There is a wide variety of different directions that an analysis can go and expecting it all to be automated is not realistic. Only if an AI tool can make someone more productive while still providing flexibility will it be adopted and useful. Github Copilot is a good example of this. \n* **Reducing the barrier to data access will result in more analysis and more data scientists, not less.** If the tools are successful at increasing productivity then we'll have more deeper analysis, and deeper analysis. As people suggested, this is similar to what happened when spreadsheets came on the scene, it did not automate away analysis jobs, instead the amount of analysis went up. \n* **Converting insights from analyses into more consumable formats (like email, slides, docs) should get easier with Gen AI.** Once the insights are available we should hopefully be able to publish in a bunch of different formats. This is still to be proved but appears to be one of the early value props of GenAI. \n\nFootnote about me: I love working with data. It's been the single thing that has helped me stand out in my 10+ year career in FAANG. I've started as business analyst then data scientist then data engineering then moved to a PM role on a data product. Now I'm consumer PM and guess what, data is how I figure out what is right to build for my product and what sets me apart. \n\nOriginal thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1amdu42/how\\_do\\_you\\_think\\_ai\\_will\\_change\\_data\\_science/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1amdu42/how_do_you_think_ai_will_change_data_science/)", "author_fullname": "t2_tszztjadn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How do you think AI will change data science (V2)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1anxoug", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.18, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1707619898.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, humbled by my last post where I raised ideas for the impact AI may have on data science. I took a lot away from the thread and i want to try again with a fresh take which incorporates the feedback and discussion from the last one. Let me know if you guys think this is closer to the mark and where you agree/disagree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might AI change Data Science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI tools need to work for Data Scientists first and foremost.&lt;/strong&gt; AI is not going to turn anyone into a Data Scientist magically overnight. Data professionals are ultimately the ones who will be analyzing the data and telling the story so the tools need to work for them. If the community and user base does not adopt a tool then it will never get traction. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI may provide productivity benefits for analysis but the data professional will still need to be in the driving seat.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a wide variety of different directions that an analysis can go and expecting it all to be automated is not realistic. Only if an AI tool can make someone more productive while still providing flexibility will it be adopted and useful. Github Copilot is a good example of this. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the barrier to data access will result in more analysis and more data scientists, not less.&lt;/strong&gt; If the tools are successful at increasing productivity then we&amp;#39;ll have more deeper analysis, and deeper analysis.
