I'll try to fill in all the details that I would have wanted to know beforehand when I started this journey.\n\n\n\n# 1) Summary of my data engineering journey\n\nBefore getting interested in data engineering specifically, I knew a bit about programming, I did some personal-business-ish projects involving Python, Javascript and websites.\n\nLast year, I started educating myself more specifically on the data engineering field. First, I took an online bootcamp for data engineering (Datacamp in the \"Data Engineer with Python\" path), then two small DE projects hosted in and using GCP tooling (presented on my github), then the GCP Professional Data Engineer certification. After this GCP certification, I felt a bit more confident in my abilities so I started applying for jobs for \\~2 months. I got interviews with 4 companies and among those one going to the third round, but all ended in rejections. Then I completed 2 Coursera courses on Machine Learning (those from Andrew Ng, mostly for fun, and also because it was \"in the air\"), then two certifications in a row from Microsoft, PL-300 (Power BI Data Analyst) and DP-300 (Azure SQL), then two personal Data Analysis projects applying what I saw in those 2 certifications (also added to my github). Just after this, I began \\~2 months of applying to \"data engineer\" AND \"data analyst\" job postings, and I got my job as a data engineer, roughly a year after I started this journey into data engineering.\n\nAll this education phase took a lot of my time. Overall, in the 12 months that I spent trying to get into the data field, I spent 8 months educating myself, and 4 months actively searching for a job. I would do only one or the other without mixing the two.\n\nDuring the 4 months of active job searching, I applied to 274 jobs, around 40% were \"data analyst\" job postings and 60% were \"data engineer\" job postings. I focused mainly on LinkedIn and WelcomeToTheJungle (a french job posting board for startups and tech companies). Around half of those 274 applications were made through mass \"Easy Apply\" applications on LinkedIn, where you can quickly apply with just giving your Resume and maybe a few quick questions (how much years of exp with X tool, for example). The job application that got me my job offer was an \"Easy Apply\" one.\n\nOverall, I had 11 companies contacting me, 8 actually started rounds of interviews, and at the moment of getting my DE job offer, I was interviewing with 3 companies. I cancelled my application for the 2 others after signing my job contract.\n\n\n\n# 2) Things I learned\n\n- A lot of bootcamps do not emphasize enough how important SQL is. I guess it's because Python is more trendy nowadays, and SQL seems like an old language. But oh boy how wrong this is. Data Engineering is about data. All the data in this world are inside databases. SQL is the unchallenged king language for querying databases. Not knowing SQL as a data engineer candidate is suicide. As an aspiring data engineer, everytime you watch a tutorial on machine learning using Python (as I did myself \\^\\^), you should repent and flagellate yourself for not practicing your SQL.  But for the rest of the tools, online bootcamps + some Cloud-related courses seem to do a pretty good job at describing the typical type of tech stack there is out there. When applying I was already familiar with a lot of tools and practices that were mentioned in the typical DE job postings.\n\n- I learned that I was maybe a bit too infused with Twitter and Reddit tech culture, and that it's not like that in real life for most of the people that will hire you. I don't know how it is really in America overall, but, from my perspective, if you live in Europe, go from the principle that everything you hear from America's tech culture, or even worse, Silicon Valley tech culture, needs to be taken with a big grain of salt. In my experience, companies I encountered did not seem ready to embrace the \"degrees are irrelevant, show me what you do\" kind of mood that you see a lot of tech bros promote. I had a senior person from a tech consulting firm tell me in an interview \"well you know, our clients freak out when we put people without an Engineering Degree on their project\". Well, bad news for me.Also, if you're like me and you don't have a CS degree, and your resume go through a HR department that is responsible for the hiring, don't expect HR to do you any favor. If you fuck up, managers will ask \"who chose this candidate\", and the HR person will be responsible. HR people usually don't want to take this risk, so they will usually choose the most reasonable and less risky junior candidates, and usually those have a CS Degree. So if you don't have a CS degree, you might have more chance for a potential manager/coworker actually reading your resume if you apply to smaller companies/startups, where the stakeholders are hiring directly themselves, without the HR filter. Of course, hiring an atypical candidate is always more risky for everyone, but keep in mind that the corporate environment is usually geared towards less risky options since numbers are bigger. Somebody who is hiring in a smaller company might have the time to actually look at you more precisely and \"feel\" you more, and the risk of an atypical profile might be dampened by this from their perspective. Whereas in a corporate environment, where HR could hire hundreds of people each year, things need to go forward and you can't take the same time to gently analyze every aspect of someone's personality. Risk need to be minimized, so usually weird profiles go to the bin just in case, and things like which college you went to, internships, recommendations, etc, all the things that \"look good on a resume\" usually prevail.\n\n- Companies that are run by people outside of the social media tech culture mostly do not know the nuances of the data role definitions as we see it on this subreddit, on Twitter or on Youtube. Most people are not hooked on the latest social media tech trends, and the subtle nuances that you could see here and there between what is a \"BI Engineer\" or a \"Data Engineer\" or a \"Data Analyst\" or a \"Back-end Dev\" really just fly above most people's heads. Companies, especially the biggest and oldest which happen to employ a lot of people, have their own internal names for specific roles, missions, systems, etc... And usually that will not align with what you see on social media. HR department know that some titles are now trendy and they use it to attract candidates. But never forget that there will always be a difference between the social media \"standard definition\" of a given data role and what your actual job will be like. Companies have systems to be taken care of. They don't care about the internet's opinion about what is a \"data engineer\". Just go from the principle that you will be working around a database of some sort, using one or several of the data-related tools that exist in this universe. What truly matters in order to know what you will actually do is your team, where you are in this team, and who decides who does what. Not the actual job title on your contract. Companies use \"data engineer\" in their job postings and their job contracts, but in the end they just put you where they want. So just remember to ask specific questions about the actual job you will be doing, and people you will be working with, because taking for granted that companies know what is a \"data engineer\" is a very risky bet.\n\n- About the kind of job postings that answered my calls, contrary to what I thought was going to happen, I received 0 (ZERO) responses for all the \"Data Analyst\" job postings that I applied too (around \\~100). Before going through this experience, according to the many takes that I got from people working in the DE field on this subreddit and outside (including the youtuber I talked about in a previous post, the data janitor), I really came to the conclusion that Data Analyst was an entry level job, the easier step to take for somebody that would like to get into data engineering later on. Well, I don't know how much my experience is generalizable, but I experienced the EXACT OPPOSITE of what everyone was saying: the Data Analyst job postings completely ignored me, and the only answers I got from companies were for the Data Engineer job postings. The exact reverse of what I expected.\n\n- About the applications themselves, contrary to the advice given by my own employment counselor (who told me I needed to focus on \"quality applications\" instead of mass applying), mass spamming job applications with the 'Easy Apply' option on LinkedIn (only my resume and no cover letter) proved very fruitful to me. My DE job offer actually came from one of those mass applications. Most of my interview rounds also came from mass applications where I didn't submit any cover letter. Over the 11 companies that contacted me, I made a cover letter for only 3, given that 2 of those were unsolicited applications because I found the companies cool (I made 24 unsolicited applications overall).Also, related to this, contrary to my expectations again, mass applications did not lead to me having contact with random shitty companies or whatever. The few that contacted me actually seemed pretty nice and quite open to my \"atypical\" profile. The one company that offered me a job was actually the one company for which I remember thinking during the interviews \"wow I feel very in sync with those guys, I would love to work for them\", even though it was one of those undifferenciated mass applications. So yeah, do not underestimate how mass applications can also increase the chance that the \"right company for you\" can find you. Whether your like it or not, a part of your personality is already engraved in your resume, and that might be enough for employers to distinguish the candidates who could fit inside their company or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis journey to data engineering allowed me to learn a lot in this last year. Some aspects were as I expected them to be, and some aspects were surprisingly completely the opposite of what I was expecting.\n\nAlso, remember to not generalize what happened to me here, as a lot of what I experienced could be linked to my particular context (a Master's but no CS degree, Paris/France/Europe, had a full year to work on my career change, current tech job market, luck, etc).\n\nI hope this post can be useful to other aspiring data engineers seeking information about how to get into this field, especially to my fellow europoor tech bros :p\n\nFeel free to ask questions even if you see this post long after it has been posted. I knew I looked at a lot of old posts when I was craving for advice not so long ago.\n\nAnd for the final advice, as I experienced it myself, do not trust too much what people say on the internet lol", "author_fullname": "t2_12modp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Landing My First Data Engineering Role Without a CS Degree in Europe", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1anp313", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1707656666.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1707595625.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got my first job as a data engineer recently without a CS degree in Europe and I want to share things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the record, and this is an important context, I did this transition into DE during a full year without being employed, I don&amp;#39;t have a CS Degree (a Master&amp;#39;s in Law), I only applied for jobs in Paris and I&amp;#39;m currently working there.

Before going through this experience, according to the many takes that I got from people working in the DE field on this subreddit and outside (including the youtuber I talked about in a previous post, the data janitor), I really came to the conclusion that Data Analyst was an entry level job, the easier step to take for somebody that would like to get into data engineering later on. Well, I don&amp;#39;t know how much my experience is generalizable, but I experienced the EXACT OPPOSITE of what everyone was saying: the Data Analyst job postings completely ignored me, and the only answers I got from companies were for the Data Engineer job postings. The exact reverse of what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the applications themselves, contrary to the advice given by my own employment counselor (who told me I needed to focus on &amp;quot;quality applications&amp;quot; instead of mass applying), mass spamming job applications with the &amp;#39;Easy Apply&amp;#39; option on LinkedIn (only my resume and no cover letter) proved very fruitful to me. My DE job offer actually came from one of those mass applications. Most of my interview rounds also came from mass applications where I didn&amp;#39;t submit any cover letter. Over the 11 companies that contacted me, I made a cover letter for only 3, given that 2 of those were unsolicited applications because I found the companies cool (I made 24 unsolicited applications overall).Also, related to this, contrary to my expectations again, mass applications did not lead to me having contact with random shitty companies or whatever. The few that contacted me actually seemed pretty nice and quite open to my &amp;quot;atypical&amp;quot; profile. The one company that offered me a job was actually the one company for which I remember thinking during the interviews &amp;quot;wow I feel very in sync with those guys, I would love to work for them&amp;quot;, even though it was one of those undifferenciated mass applications. So yeah, do not underestimate how mass applications can also increase the chance that the &amp;quot;right company for you&amp;quot; can find you. Whether your like it or not, a part of your personality is already engraved in your resume, and that might be enough for employers to distinguish the candidates who could fit inside their company or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This journey to data engineering allowed me to learn a lot in this last year. Some aspects were as I expected them to be, and some aspects were surprisingly completely the opposite of what I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, remember to not generalize what happened to me here, as a lot of what I experienced could be linked to my particular context (a Master&amp;#39;s but no CS degree, Paris/France/Europe, had a full year to work on my career change, current tech job market, luck, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this post can be useful to other aspiring data engineers seeking information about how to get into this field, especially to my fellow europoor tech bros :p&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask questions even if you see this post long after it has been posted. I knew I looked at a lot of old posts when I was craving for advice not so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for the final advice, as I experienced it myself, do not trust too much what people say on the internet lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "1anp313", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nabugu", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/1anp313/landing_my_first_data_engineering_role_without_a/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1anp313/landing_my_first_data_engineering_role_without_a/", "subreddit_subscribers": 159912, "created_utc": 1707595625.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "We want to start doing unit test at my company and I wanted to gather some best practices from other folks.
