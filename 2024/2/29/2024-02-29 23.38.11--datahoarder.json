Some of the terms I use in this post I literally learned just now in this sub, trying to educate myself. \n\nI've been reading through threads on this sub over the last hour or so, researching a few questions I had around what I should best do for storage in my use case, which is very basic compared to what I have read of user setups on this sub. I think I've worked out what I need to get/do though and why, so I wanna run it by you all.\n\nWhat I'm looking at doing is a mix of data storage and data transport. Data I want to back up is run of the mill stuff, mostly videos and photos from phone(s), documents, recordings of meetings/old lectures etc. However, I also want to take and access this data with me occasionally and make use of it on the go by connecting the drive to my phone, tablet etc. Mostly this would be video content, but all of it at varying points.\n\nFrom what I've read here, I gather that broadly speaking I should use HDD for 'cold storage' back ups, and an SSD for taking data with me. I believe this is because an SSD has no moving parts, thereby making it more durable.\n\nI think I have understood that the trade-off for this physical durability is that the integrity of the stored data isn't as good because you don't get as much warning if the drive is failing, it just sort of goes because the controller dies. Also, that there are other issues around data retrieval in this event if it's a non-SATA drive (forgot the other term) and the usb port gets damaged.\n\nIssues with HDDs I have read seem to come down to SMR vs CMR. I don't really know what these are, though what I have inferred is essentially CMR &gt; SMR but CMR has become quite expensive and very difficult to get as a non-commercial user because manufacturers have pivoted to SMR (sneakily in some cases) in order to save on cost.\n\nEncryption also matters to me, so what I'm thinking is this:\n\n1) Get 2x 5TB WD Passports to use as cold storage backup drives (3, 2, 1!) because they aren't going to be written to very often, won't be transported, typically have better longevity, don't cost as much, and have a user-friendly option to set up a password access.\n\n2) Get a smaller capacity (maybe 2TB) SSD for selectively taking videos to watch on the go, transporting docs around etc, transferring the required data to it from the HDDs as and when it's needed. I like the Sandisk Extreme Pro but I've read about those failures, so I'm also looking at a Samsung T7.\n\nQuestions:\n\nDoes this make sense for the use I have described? \n\nAre there better alternatives (excluding cloud for now - already in use) or other considerations I have missed?\n\nWould one of those magnetic breakway USB C cables help mitigate the risk of port damage on a non-SATA SSD, or is magnetic anything still a no go? If it's safe, what impact does that sort of cable have on things like speed for watching videos directly from the drive?\n\n\nGrateful for any thoughts!\n\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_bhq4xz3f", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dear subject matter experts, please idiot-check my plan.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1b2l9af", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1709164632.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1709163329.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR 2x 5TB WD Passports + 1x 2TB Samsung T7 or Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD for on the go, yay or nay?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am just about as new as a newbie can be, so bear with me.

And also slightly annoyed my old ReadyNas DUO, despite the drives being fine, now doesn&amp;#39;t work in any browser because of security. Got it working in Chrome with a workaround but I think I&amp;#39;m just going to back up the drives, take them out and just use them in the dock instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1b3ctek", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "steviefaux", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1b3ctek/hdd_dock/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1b3ctek/hdd_dock/", "subreddit_subscribers": 735320, "created_utc": 1709244182.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I honestly don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I was pointed here by another user from another sub and I'm running out of options.
