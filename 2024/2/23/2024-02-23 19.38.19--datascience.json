I'm also the highest performer on my team and am anticipating a solid pay increase, but have no idea how much that would be. I'm getting antsy and have started accepting calls from recruiters.\n\nI have one possible opportunity as a hybrid data scientist... It honestly sounds like a very interesting position that is very up my alley as far as interests go. And I do prefer hybrid. The recruiter gave me an estimate for their budget and it would likely be around a 20% pay increase, which I was very happy with....\n\nBut now I have another possible opportunity for a fully remote data analyst position at a small company but the salary would be an enormous boost and would be between a 40% and 75% pay increase plus stock options which would be absolutely life changing for me and would alleviate nearly all of my current financial stress. I definitely don't prefer fully remote but for that much extra money I will figure out how to love it, lol.\n\nI was initially targeting data scientist positions because I do miss it a lot.... But for some reason I always seem to be able to get paid way more money to be a data analyst than a data scientist! Which seems to defy logic but here we are. It's so odd to me how I consistently get offered less money for more challenging jobs (I was only offered $70k as a biostatistician last time I was job searching).

I&amp;#39;m also the highest performer on my team and am anticipating a solid pay increase, but have no idea how much that would be. I&amp;#39;m getting antsy and have started accepting calls from recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have one possible opportunity as a hybrid data scientist... It honestly sounds like a very interesting position that is very up my alley as far as interests go. And I do prefer hybrid. The recruiter gave me an estimate for their budget and it would likely be around a 20% pay increase, which I was very happy with....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I have another possible opportunity for a fully remote data analyst position at a small company but the salary would be an enormous boost and would be between a 40% and 75% pay increase plus stock options which would be absolutely life changing for me and would alleviate nearly all of my current financial stress. I definitely don&amp;#39;t prefer fully remote but for that much extra money I will figure out how to love it, lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was initially targeting data scientist positions because I do miss it a lot....
