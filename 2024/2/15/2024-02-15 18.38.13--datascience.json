Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.\n\nI think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away.

with Economics major with great gpa, which is a very good major and a big deal here in egypt, the thing is:\n\nI hate it here and it sucks in egypt nowdays economically and politically so, i decided to take my MS in (Germany) cuz basiclly it is the only way to get the hell out of here ok?, So,\n\nNow Iam about to finish IBM DS pro certificate and guys, I sincerely love DS and stats and I decided to make it my career, ok?\n\nHere comes the problem for me, all the DS MSc in Germany require some cedit hours in CS and some advanced math and stat (which i know already btw) so according to my economics major I only accuired some basic math and stat and economitrics which is not enough for a DS MSc degree, so my questions are :\n\n1) there is one university that can accept me for a DS MSc ( not the greatest uni but its ok)\nWith my econ degree but keep in mind there is a chance i get rejected anyways\ud83e\udee0 So,\n\nIs it better to just prey i get accepted? Or should i apply to non DS MSc like (Economitrics ,maybe statistics(not a big chance i get accepted loke DS),economics and business informatics, and other econ specializatins)\n\n2) is having a domain knowladge with a MSc in economitrics(not DS focused i mean) for example will give me an edge in the DS market?
