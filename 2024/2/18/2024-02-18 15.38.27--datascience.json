of being a data scientist and could use some advice on how to move forward.I work as a data scientist at a consultancy firm specializing in data; Company culture is great, my work is fully remote, and the clients are mostly big companies with real opportunities to apply ML. So, I like the work I'm doing, but it's not a high-paying job, even for leadership positions. I think it has to do with the hourly rate the clients are willing to pay and the company's philosophy of growing with a \"healthy\" profit margin\n\nQuick background: I've got an electrical engineering degree, but my academic performance in college was not good, and hated every minute of it. I applied for an entry-level data science job with zero prior experience or knowledge about the area. I made it through the initial process,  and during the technical round I worked on a business case/ds project the company gave me for 10  days and nights, and to my surprise I landed the job by delivering a very good project (felt like an impostor ever since, but that fueled me to study)I managed to be promoted into a squad leadership role overseeing the technical quality for data science projects and helping with planning in a couple of squads within my first year because of my performance and also soft-skills.While I've learned a lot, I'm starting to feel like I'm hitting a plateau, and my current paycheck doesn't match the responsibilities I've taken on. The company has a promising future, but the reality is that, right now, no one is being paid a lot for what they deliver, especially middle leadership.\n\nDuring these 2yrs, I was able to see very different applications of data science, and also build a couple of them from scratch, but I feel because of the way the hours are structured in the projects and how much the clients are willing to pay I'm not being able to delve deep because the main focus is on delivering quick-wins and proving value with the projects. This became more of an issue for me when I was promoted because my pay increased and my hours were spread over multiple projects to oversee and fix stuff instead of building them from scratch. I'm hopping from project to project when they are fated for a bad end to deliver a good enough solution.\n\nI have the drive to learn stuff and solve problems, and I think if I put my mind to something, I could be making more. Right now, I'm leaving comfortably because I moved back to my parents, but I'm 26 years old and wish to have the option of living comfortably alone in the next 2 yrs.\n\nI'm concerned about becoming too specialized in building prediction models because tasks like dashboard creation, report generation, and data modeling (in warehouses) are outsourced to others in the teams. So the skills I'm building are very machine-learning-focused, and I skipped some basics.I see a lot of job applications and data scientists saying that most of the job is building dashboards and generating insights and although most DSs do not like this kind of job, I'm kind of worried that by focusing on only machine learning and scraping the surface of many problems I'm sacrificing future high paying opportunities for career growth within the company.\n\nI've got experience with various cloud providers and certifications under my belt (AWS, Azure, and Databricks) but I'm wondering about the next steps to avoid being good at something that will not be paying well in the future.\n\nAnother thing is that in my two years, I was able to grow fast because I dedicated myself a lot outside the working hours, I don't want this to be my life. I'm doing it because I believe the first 2/3 years will be instrumental to achieving a higher-paying and stable job.\n\nI'm worried and confused.\n\nShould I stick it out in my current role, knowing that even a potential tech lead position might not pay off if the company's revenue doesn't spike, or that the next promotion will come at a greater cost?Should I sacrifice the career growth in my company to build more general skills such as dashboard building?\n\nWhat are the skills (outside soft-skills) I should be looking to build?\n\nI'm open to you sharing your career insights, your experience, or how to navigate this moment.

So, I like the work I&amp;#39;m doing, but it&amp;#39;s not a high-paying job, even for leadership positions. I think it has to do with the hourly rate the clients are willing to pay and the company&amp;#39;s philosophy of growing with a &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; profit margin&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quick background: I&amp;#39;ve got an electrical engineering degree, but my academic performance in college was not good, and hated every minute of it. I applied for an entry-level data science job with zero prior experience or knowledge about the area. I made it through the initial process,  and during the technical round I worked on a business case/ds project the company gave me for 10  days and nights, and to my surprise I landed the job by delivering a very good project (felt like an impostor ever since, but that fueled me to study)I managed to be promoted into a squad leadership role overseeing the technical quality for data science projects and helping with planning in a couple of squads within my first year because of my performance and also soft-skills.While I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot, I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like I&amp;#39;m hitting a plateau, and my current paycheck doesn&amp;#39;t match the responsibilities I&amp;#39;ve taken on. The company has a promising future, but the reality is that, right now, no one is being paid a lot for what they deliver, especially middle leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During these 2yrs, I was able to see very different applications of data science, and also build a couple of them from scratch, but I feel because of the way the hours are structured in the projects and how much the clients are willing to pay I&amp;#39;m not being able to delve deep because the main focus is on delivering quick-wins and proving value with the projects. This became more of an issue for me when I was promoted because my pay increased and my hours were spread over multiple projects to oversee and fix stuff instead of building them from scratch. I&amp;#39;m hopping from project to project when they are fated for a bad end to deliver a good enough solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the drive to learn stuff and solve problems, and I think if I put my mind to something, I could be making more. Right now, I&amp;#39;m leaving comfortably because I moved back to my parents, but I&amp;#39;m 26 years old and wish to have the option of living comfortably alone in the next 2 yrs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m concerned about becoming too specialized in building prediction models because tasks like dashboard creation, report generation, and data modeling (in warehouses) are outsourced to others in the teams. So the skills I&amp;#39;m building are very machine-learning-focused, and I skipped some basics.I see a lot of job applications and data scientists saying that most of the job is building dashboards and generating insights and although most DSs do not like this kind of job, I&amp;#39;m kind of worried that by focusing on only machine learning and scraping the surface of many problems I&amp;#39;m sacrificing future high paying opportunities for career growth within the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got experience with various cloud providers and certifications under my belt (AWS, Azure, and Databricks) but I&amp;#39;m wondering about the next steps to avoid being good at something that will not be paying well in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that in my two years, I was able to grow fast because I dedicated myself a lot outside the working hours, I don&amp;#39;t want this to be my life. I&amp;#39;m doing it because I believe the first 2/3 years will be instrumental to achieving a higher-paying and stable job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m worried and confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I stick it out in my current role, knowing that even a potential tech lead position might not pay off if the company&amp;#39;s revenue doesn&amp;#39;t spike, or that the next promotion will come at a greater cost?Should I sacrifice the career growth in my company to build more general skills such as dashboard building?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are the skills (outside soft-skills) I should be looking to build?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m open to you sharing your career insights, your experience, or how to navigate this moment. Feel free to ask more questions.
