I have a passion for DS which mainly started during my 2nd year and i kept at it until getting some knowledge about the tools and the theories. I have also participated in projects here and there plus have gathered more than a year of research experience in computational chemistry.\n\nConsidering the market situation and everything, i am still determining what i want to do in the coming days. I want to go into the industry/work line as my first choice. Academics is also a choice i might consider.\n\nI mainly want to integrate my passion for DS with chemistry/chemical engineering as i dont want my 4-year degree to go to waste and I also keep my domain expertise at least. right now i have these options-\n\n1. Get admitted to the masters classes in the same dept which doesnt require the results of my bachelor's (as its the same dept) and try to contact professors or recruiters that will take me for a chem/chemE + Ds position. Note that trying to get a master's other than my dept will take me 6-7 months more compared to my peers as my results will take that much time to be published.\n\n2. go to the capital city and pursue a master's in cse with a major in data science while applying for DS related jobs to get that credibility and experience as there isnt many job position in DS in my current city.\n\n3. Will fully transitioning to DS be a good choice? i think its a risky move as ill be competing with cse/cs/stats grads who are already buffed up to begin with, which makes me much even more unlikely to get selected.\n\nTbh, i want to go into the industry/work line as my first choice.
