So please keep it in mind when reading. Basically using Incus over Proxmox then comes down to points like:\n\n* Big UI vs small UI\n* Do you need all of the Proxmox features?\n* ...\n\n--------\n\n# Introduction\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI recently moved from Proxmox to Incus for my main \u201chypervisor UI\u201d  since personally think that Proxmox is too much for most people.  I also don't want to pay a subscription^(\\*1) for my home server, since the electricity costs are high enough on their own. So first allow me to clarify my situation and who I think this could be interesting for, and then I will explain the Incus Project. Afterwards, I would tell you about my move to Incus and the experience I gathered.\n\n# The situation\n\nFirstly, I would like to tell you about myself. I have been hosting my home services on a Hetzner root server for several years. About a year ago, I converted an old PC into a server. Like many people, I started with Proxmox (without a subscription) as the base OS. I set up various services such as GrampsWeb, Nextcloud, Gitea, and others as Linux Containers, Docker, and VMs. However, I noticed that I did not use the advanced features of Proxmox except for the firewall and the backup function. Don't get me wrong, Proxmox is great and the prices for a basic subscription are not bad either. But why do I need Proxmox if I only want to host containers and VMs? Canonical has developed LXD for this, an abstraction for LXCs. However, this add-on is only available as a snap and is best hosted on Ubuntu (technically, Debian and its derivatives are of course also possible if you install snap), but I would like to build my system freely and without any puppet strings. Fortunately, the Incus project has recently joined \u201cLinuxContainers.org\u201d, which is actually like LXD without Snap or Canonical.\n\n# What is Incus?\n\nIf you want to keep it short, [Incus](https://github.com/lxc/incus) is a WebUI for the management of Linux containers and VMs.\n\n# The long version:\n\nIn my opinion, Incus is the little brother of Proxmox. It offers (almost) all the functions that would be available via the lxc commandline. For me, the most important ones are:\n\n* Backups\n* clustering\n* Creation, management and customization of containers and QEMU VMs\n* Dashboard\n* Awesome [documentation](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/)\n\nThe [installation](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/installing/) is relatively simple, and the UI is self-explanatory. Anyone who uses LXC with Proxmox will find their way around Incus immediately. However, be warned, there is currently no firewall and network management in Incus.\n\nIf you want to set static IP addresses for your LXC containers, you currently have to use the command line. Apart from that, Incus creates a network via a virtual network adapter. As far as I know, each container should always be assigned the [same address based on its MAC](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/using-static-ips-with-lxd/1291/4), but I would rather not rely on DHCP because I forward ports via my router. Furthermore, I want to make sure to know what address my containers have.\n\n# My move to Incus and what I learned\n\n*Warning: I will not explain in detail the installation of Debian or other software. Just Incus and some essentials. Furthermore, I will not explain how to back up your data from Proxmox. I just ssh into all Containers and Machines and manually downloaded all the data and config files.*\n\n# Hardware\n\nTo keep things simple, here is my setup. I have a physical server running Linux (in my case Debian 12). The server has four network ports, two of which I use. On this server, I have installed [Webmin](https://webmin.com/) to manage the firewall and the other aspects of the physical server. For hosting my services, I use [Linux containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/) that are optionally equipped with Docker. The server is connected to a Fritz!Box with two static addresses and ports for Internet access. I also have a domain with Hetzner, with a subdomain including a wildcard that points to my public Fritz!Box address.\n\nI also have a Synology NAS, but this is only used to store my external backups. Accordingly, I will not go into the NAS any further, except in connection with setting up my backup strategy.\n\n# Installation\n\nTo use my services, I first reinstalled and updated [Debian](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/). I mounted three volumes in addition to the standard file system. My file system looks like this:\n\n* / \u2192 RAID1 via two 1 TB NVMe SSDs\n* /backup \u2192 4 TB SATA SSD\n* /nextcloud \u2192 2 TB SATA SSD\n* /synology \u2192 The Synology NAS\n\nAfter Debian was installed, I installed and set up Webmin. I set static addresses for my network adapters and made the Webmin portal accessible only via the first adapter.\n\nThen I installed the lxc package and followed the Inucus getting-start guide for the installation. The guide is excellent and self-explanatory. I did not deviate from the guide during the installation, except that I chose a fixed network for the Incus network adapter. I also explicitly assigned the Incus UI to the first network adapter.\n\nSo that I can use Incus with VMs, I also installed the Debian packages for virtualization with QEMU.\n\n# First Container\n\nMy first Container should use Docker and then host the [Nginx proxy manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) so that I can reach my separate network from the outside. To do this, I first edited the default profile and removed the default eth0 network adapter from the profile. This is only needed if you want to assign static addresses to the containers. The profile does not need to be adapted to use DHCP. The problem is that you cannot modify a network adapter created via a profile, as this would create a deviation from the profile.\n\nIf you would like to set defaults for memory size, CPU cores etc. as in Proxmox, you can customize the profile accordingly. [Profiles in Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/profiles/) are templates for containers and VMs. Each instance is always assigned to a profile and is adapted when the profile is changed, if possible.\n\nTo host my proxy via LXC with Docker, I created a new container with Ubuntu Jammy (cloud) and assigned an address to the container with the command \u201cincus config device set &lt;containername&gt; eth0 ipv4.address 192.168.xxx.xxx\u201d. To use docker, the container must now also be given the option of nested virtualization. This is done by default in Proxmox and also took the longest for debugging. To assign the attribute, you now have to use the \u201cincus config set &lt;containername&gt; [security.nesting true](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/what-does-security-nesting-true/7156)\u201d command and Docker can be used in LXC. Unfortunately, this attribute cannot be stored in a profile, which means that you have to input the command for each Container that is to use Docker after it has been created.\n\nYou can then access the terminal via the Incus UI and install Docker. The [installation of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and the updating of containers can also be [automated via Cloudinit](https://gist.github.com/syntaqx/9dd3ff11fb3d48b032c84f3e31af9163), for which I have created an extra Docker profile in Incus with the corresponding cloud-init config. However, you must remember that \u201csecurtiy.nesting\u201d must always be set to true for containers with the profile; otherwise Docker cannot work.\n\nI then created and started a docker compose file for NGINX Proxy.\n\n*Important: If you want to use the proxy via the Internet, I do not recommend using the default port for the UI to reduce the attack surface.*\n\nTo reach the interface or the network of the containers, I defined a [static route](https://en.avm.de/service/knowledge-base/dok/FRITZ-Box-7590/581_Configuring-a-static-IP-route-in-the-FRITZ-Box/) in my Fritz!Box. This route pointed to the second static IP address of the server, to avoid accessing the WebUI Ports for Webmin and Incus from the outside. I was then able to access the UI for NGINX Proxy and set up a user. I then created a port share on my Fritz!Box for the address of the proxy and released ports 80 + 443. Furthermore, I also entered my public address in the Hetzner DNS for my subdomain and waited two minutes for the DNS to propagate. In addition, I also created a proxy host in the Nginx Proxy UI and pointed it to the address of the container. If everything is configured correctly, you should now be able to access your proxy UI from outside.\n\n*Important: For secure access, I recommend creating an SSL wildcard* [*certificate*](https://medium.com/@life-is-short-so-enjoy-it/homelab-nginx-proxy-manager-setup-ssl-certificate-with-domain-name-in-cloudflare-dns-732af64ddc0b) *via the Nginx Proxy UI before introducing new services and assigning it to the UI, and all future proxy hosts.*\n\nSo if you have proper access to your Nginx UI, you are already through with the basic setup. You can now host numerous services via LXCs and VMs. For access, you only need to create new host in Nginx and use the local address as the endpoint.\n\n# Backups\n\nIn order not to drag out the long post, I would like to briefly address the topic of backups. You can set regular [backups](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/instances_backup/#instances-snapshots) in the Incus profiles, which I did (Every Instance will be saved every week and the backups will be deleted after one month); these will then end up in the \u201c/var/lib/incus/backups/instances\u201d directory. I set up a cron job that packages the entire backup directory with tar.gz and then moves it to the /backup hard drive. From there it is also copied again to my Synology NAS under /synology. Of course, you can expand the whole thing as you wish, but for me, this backup strategy is enough.\n\nIf you have several servers, you can also provide a complete Incus backup server. You can find information about this [here](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/backup/#secondary-backup-incus-server).\n\n^(\\*1)I want to make clear that I do donate if possible to all the remarkable and outstanding projects I touched upon, but I don't like the subscription model of Proxmox, since every so often I just don't have the money for it.\n\n\n\n**If you have questions, please ask me in the comment section and I will get back to you.**\n\n**If I notice that information is missing in this post, I will update it accordingly.**", "author_fullname": "t2_815htf3l", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Moving from Proxmox to Incus (LXC Webinterface)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "guide", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1ay50ya", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Guide", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1708708489.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1708706392.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the comment section i found out, that you dont need a proxmox-subscription to update. So please keep it in mind when reading. Basically using Incus over Proxmox then comes down to points like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Big UI vs small UI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you need all of the Proxmox features?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently moved from Proxmox to Incus for my main \u201chypervisor UI\u201d  since personally think that Proxmox is too much for most people.  I also don&amp;#39;t want to pay a subscription&lt;sup&gt;\\&lt;/sup&gt;1) for my home server, since the electricity costs are high enough on their own. So first allow me to clarify my situation and who I think this could be interesting for, and then I will explain the Incus Project. Afterwards, I would tell you about my move to Incus and the experience I gathered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The situation&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I would like to tell you about myself. I have been hosting my home services on a Hetzner root server for several years. About a year ago, I converted an old PC into a server. Like many people, I started with Proxmox (without a subscription) as the base OS. I set up various services such as GrampsWeb, Nextcloud, Gitea, and others as Linux Containers, Docker, and VMs. However, I noticed that I did not use the advanced features of Proxmox except for the firewall and the backup function. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, Proxmox is great and the prices for a basic subscription are not bad either. But why do I need Proxmox if I only want to host containers and VMs? Canonical has developed LXD for this, an abstraction for LXCs. However, this add-on is only available as a snap and is best hosted on Ubuntu (technically, Debian and its derivatives are of course also possible if you install snap), but I would like to build my system freely and without any puppet strings. Fortunately, the Incus project has recently joined \u201cLinuxContainers.org\u201d, which is actually like LXD without Snap or Canonical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What is Incus?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep it short, &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/lxc/incus\"&gt;Incus&lt;/a&gt; is a WebUI for the management of Linux containers and VMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The long version:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Incus is the little brother of Proxmox. It offers (almost) all the functions that would be available via the lxc commandline. For me, the most important ones are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Backups&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;clustering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creation, management and customization of containers and QEMU VMs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dashboard&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Awesome &lt;a href=\"https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/\"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/installing/\"&gt;installation&lt;/a&gt; is relatively simple, and the UI is self-explanatory. Anyone who uses LXC with Proxmox will find their way around Incus immediately. However, be warned, there is currently no firewall and network management in Incus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to set static IP addresses for your LXC containers, you currently have to use the command line. Apart from that, Incus creates a network via a virtual network adapter. As far as I know, each container should always be assigned the &lt;a href=\"https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/using-static-ips-with-lxd/1291/4\"&gt;same address based on its MAC&lt;/a&gt;, but I would rather not rely on DHCP because I forward ports via my router. Furthermore, I want to make sure to know what address my containers have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My move to Incus and what I learned&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: I will not explain in detail the installation of Debian or other software. Just Incus and some essentials. Furthermore, I will not explain how to back up your data from Proxmox. I just ssh into all Containers and Machines and manually downloaded all the data and config files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Hardware&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, here is my setup. I have a physical server running Linux (in my case Debian 12). The server has four network ports, two of which I use. On this server, I have installed &lt;a href=\"https://webmin.com/\"&gt;Webmin&lt;/a&gt; to manage the firewall and the other aspects of the physical server. For hosting my services, I use &lt;a href=\"https://linuxcontainers.org/\"&gt;Linux containers&lt;/a&gt; that are optionally equipped with Docker. The server is connected to a Fritz!Box with two static addresses and ports for Internet access. I also have a domain with Hetzner, with a subdomain including a wildcard that points to my public Fritz!Box address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have a Synology NAS, but this is only used to store my external backups. Accordingly, I will not go into the NAS any further, except in connection with setting up my backup strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To use my services, I first reinstalled and updated &lt;a href=\"https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/\"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;. I mounted three volumes in addition to the standard file system. My file system looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;/ \u2192 RAID1 via two 1 TB NVMe SSDs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;/backup \u2192 4 TB SATA SSD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;/nextcloud \u2192 2 TB SATA SSD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;/synology \u2192 The Synology NAS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Debian was installed, I installed and set up Webmin. I set static addresses for my network adapters and made the Webmin portal accessible only via the first adapter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I installed the lxc package and followed the Inucus getting-start guide for the installation. The guide is excellent and self-explanatory. I did not deviate from the guide during the installation, except that I chose a fixed network for the Incus network adapter. I also explicitly assigned the Incus UI to the first network adapter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that I can use Incus with VMs, I also installed the Debian packages for virtualization with QEMU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;First Container&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first Container should use Docker and then host the &lt;a href=\"https://nginxproxymanager.com/\"&gt;Nginx proxy manager&lt;/a&gt; so that I can reach my separate network from the outside. To do this, I first edited the default profile and removed the default eth0 network adapter from the profile. This is only needed if you want to assign static addresses to the containers. The profile does not need to be adapted to use DHCP. The problem is that you cannot modify a network adapter created via a profile, as this would create a deviation from the profile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to set defaults for memory size, CPU cores etc. as in Proxmox, you can customize the profile accordingly. &lt;a href=\"https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/profiles/\"&gt;Profiles in Incus&lt;/a&gt; are templates for containers and VMs. Each instance is always assigned to a profile and is adapted when the profile is changed, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To host my proxy via LXC with Docker, I created a new container with Ubuntu Jammy (cloud) and assigned an address to the container with the command \u201cincus config device set &amp;lt;containername&amp;gt; eth0 ipv4.address 192.168.xxx.xxx\u201d. To use docker, the container must now also be given the option of nested virtualization. This is done by default in Proxmox and also took the longest for debugging. To assign the attribute, you now have to use the \u201cincus config set &amp;lt;containername&amp;gt; &lt;a href=\"https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/what-does-security-nesting-true/7156\"&gt;security.nesting true&lt;/a&gt;\u201d command and Docker can be used in LXC. Unfortunately, this attribute cannot be stored in a profile, which means that you have to input the command for each Container that is to use Docker after it has been created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can then access the terminal via the Incus UI and install Docker. The &lt;a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\"&gt;installation of Docker&lt;/a&gt; and the updating of containers can also be &lt;a href=\"https://gist.github.com/syntaqx/9dd3ff11fb3d48b032c84f3e31af9163\"&gt;automated via Cloudinit&lt;/a&gt;, for which I have created an extra Docker profile in Incus with the corresponding cloud-init config. However, you must remember that \u201csecurtiy.nesting\u201d must always be set to true for containers with the profile; otherwise Docker cannot work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then created and started a docker compose file for NGINX Proxy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important: If you want to use the proxy via the Internet, I do not recommend using the default port for the UI to reduce the attack surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reach the interface or the network of the containers, I defined a &lt;a href=\"https://en.avm.de/service/knowledge-base/dok/FRITZ-Box-7590/581_Configuring-a-static-IP-route-in-the-FRITZ-Box/\"&gt;static route&lt;/a&gt; in my Fritz!Box. This route pointed to the second static IP address of the server, to avoid accessing the WebUI Ports for Webmin and Incus from the outside. I was then able to access the UI for NGINX Proxy and set up a user. I then created a port share on my Fritz!Box for the address of the proxy and released ports 80 + 443. Furthermore, I also entered my public address in the Hetzner DNS for my subdomain and waited two minutes for the DNS to propagate. In addition, I also created a proxy host in the Nginx Proxy UI and pointed it to the address of the container. If everything is configured correctly, you should now be able to access your proxy UI from outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important: For secure access, I recommend creating an SSL wildcard&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/@life-is-short-so-enjoy-it/homelab-nginx-proxy-manager-setup-ssl-certificate-with-domain-name-in-cloudflare-dns-732af64ddc0b\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;certificate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;via the Nginx Proxy UI before introducing new services and assigning it to the UI, and all future proxy hosts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you have proper access to your Nginx UI, you are already through with the basic setup. You can now host numerous services via LXCs and VMs. For access, you only need to create new host in Nginx and use the local address as the endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Backups&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order not to drag out the long post, I would like to briefly address the topic of backups. You can set regular &lt;a href=\"https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/instances_backup/#instances-snapshots\"&gt;backups&lt;/a&gt; in the Incus profiles, which I did (Every Instance will be saved every week and the backups will be deleted after one month); these will then end up in the \u201c/var/lib/incus/backups/instances\u201d directory.

with family and friends, and which is mostly photos (20-50 MB per file) and videos (5-10 GB per file) from holidays and family reunions.\n\nThe core of my question is: is there a decent alternative to Synology Quick connect that meets the following criteria?\n\n1) No technical know-how or software installation required on the client side\n2) The solution is self hosted or locally manageable (no VPS*)\n3) Must allow high bandwidth traffic for file sharing, and ideally for video streaming\n4) Secure and private, ideally FOSS\n*Unless such solution is free and compliant with 3).\n\nSo far I've tested CloudFlare tunnels, they work great to access non-critical services, they match 1 and 2 but fail 3 and 4.

The rest of the solutions I have read about here and elsewhere on the internet usually fail at 1 or 2, which are major to me, or sometimes the compliance with 3 is unclear.\n\nDoes anyone know about another solution that would be a match to all my criteria?

here to ask a question that has been plaguing me for some time:\n\nShould I choose a vps or a dedicated server?\n\n**The main use will be:**  \n- host two of my ecommerce completely in html, css, javascript.\n\nThese **do not** use wordpress, **but use** small databases for our review system.  \nThey use several .php pages that resolve an api of external services to redeem codes and products.  \nIn addition, I will need to host about 500-1000 mailboxes using roundcube and it will all be managed through Plesk.\n\n**Secondary uses:**  \n- We are thinking of expanding and offering plans for resellers, consequently offering our .php pages solving api to resellers as well so that they can have their own branded pages and we think we could get to about 100-150 .php pages hosted this year.\n\n**Tertiary uses:**  \n- In my spare time I like to work on creating sites and I was thinking of having them hosted by me to scrape together some extra income and satisfy my clients as best I can, it's still about 5-15 sites.  \n- Also I should host small discord bots for my communities, about 5.  \n\n\nThe whole thing (discord bots excluded for obvious reasons) will be under cdn of cloudflare.  \nTraffic is still a question mark, but we expect it to have an exponential increase this year (my guess is we could get 50-100 peak concurrent users)  \n\n\nNow I'm starting to expand, I'm using a vps with 4cores and 6gb of ram for about 10 euros a month and I have to admit I haven't had a bad time.\n\n**The problem:**  \nI'm afraid of expanding our services and then finding myself having to move everything to a dedicated server to get everything working at its best, spending more than it would cost to upgrade the vps and receiving inferior performance.\n\n**What do I need?**  \n- Without a shadow of a doubt the highest possible uptime.  \n- Zero performance drops even during peak users.  \n- Good support in case of problems.  \n- A decent level of security and privacy.\n\nCan I get all this with a vps or is it worth spending a little more to go with a dedicated one?  \nCould you please list the reason for your answer and, if possible, the pros and cons?  \nAm I making a mistake to host everything on one place?  \nWhich brand would you recommend?  \n  \n**Whatever your answer is, vps or dedicated:**  \n**what minimum specifications should it have to meet my requirements?**\n\n*Extras: I saw that hetzner is offering a dedicated with Intel XEON E-2176G (6 cores 12 threads) + 64gb ram and almost 2tb nvme ssd for only 36 euro per month, what do you

Simplified, Huly serves as an \"All-in-One Replacement for Linear/Jira, Slack, Notion, Motion, and more.\" You can explore the source code for Huly here: [https://github.com/hcengineering/platform](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform).\n\nAs we've entered production mode, our next goal is to refine the self-hosting capabilities of our product. To this end, we're reaching out to the community for advice on optimal packaging strategies and to address various self-hosting scenarios.\n\nCurrently, we support deployment through docker-compose, which our developers use daily for local testing. Additionally, we offer configurations for deploying Huly into a Kubernetes cluster. These two methods are our primary focus, but we're open to expanding our support based on your feedback.\n\nHuly deployment comprises several components, including:\n\n* Multiple stateless services (within docker containers)\n* Integration-specific stateless services (e.g., for Google Mail, Google Calendar, Slack)\n* MongoDB instance(s)\n* Elasticsearch instance(s)\n* Minio instance(s)\n\nDeploying these components with docker-compose is straightforward, but we're eager to learn from both seasoned and novice self-hosters about best practices, especially for managing stateful services like MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Minio.\n\nOur questions revolve around two main areas:\n\n1. **Shared Services**: Is there interest in a setup where multiple self-hosted products share instances of services like Minio or Elasticsearch to use resources more efficiently? Is this approach still relevant?\n2. **Stateful Services Hosting**: Managing stateful services involves complexities related to persistent data, such as ensuring data availability after restarts and implementing backup strategies. How do you manage these challenges, and what best practices can you share? For example we manage stateful services in separate VMs out of Kubernetes cluster. I would not like to say this is a way to go, but is this a scenario some people would love to use as well?\n\nAlso, we're addressing the complexities of integrating with external services, for example Google Calendar, which is vital for Huly's Personal and Team planning features. Integrating with Google Calendar necessitates Google's permission to use their APIs\u2014a process that is straightforward for our main deployment at [https://huly.io](https://huly.io). However, this integration might present challenges for self-hosted instances, including navigating legal and usage terms. We're interested in understanding how the self-hosting community approaches these scenarios.\n\nLastly, we're considering email notification services. Currently, we use AWS SES, but we understand the need for flexibility in self-hosted environments. Would support for multiple email services be beneficial (because sending email is quite complicated this days), or is an SMTP server sufficient?\n\nAlso what you guys think about supporting services like *elestio* in addition to docker-compose and Kubernetes options for deployment?\n\nWe're committed to making Huly an excellent option for self-hosting and eagerly await your insights and suggestions.\n\nThank you! -- The Huly Team", "author_fullname": "t2_8okoad9nw", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Seeking Help to Enhance Product's Self-Hosting Capabilities", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1aypth5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1708764040.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear &lt;a href=\"/r/selfhosted\"&gt;r/selfhosted&lt;/a&gt; community,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re developing Huly, an open-source product designed for on-premises installation by end users.
