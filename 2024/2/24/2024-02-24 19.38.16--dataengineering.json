Since we do not have write access to the original database, at which point in the pipeline should we do these manual cleaning steps so that (a) we do not make any irreversible changes to the extracts we are sent; (b) the steps/logic for how we went to e.g. misspellings in the .csv to cleaner data is properly tracked and logged? This latter point is important - I do not want to just overwrite cells in the .csv files we were sent and be unable to trace exactly what we changed, how much we changed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "1aysd2j", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bhagafat", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/1aysd2j/proper_handling_storage_and_cleaning_of_manual/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1aysd2j/proper_handling_storage_and_cleaning_of_manual/", "subreddit_subscribers": 163324, "created_utc": 1708774029.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Hi all, I'm a 25 yo management consultant at a top-tier consulting firm and currently make around $130K per year before bonus.
