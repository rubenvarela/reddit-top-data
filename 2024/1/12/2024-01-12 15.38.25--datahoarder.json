Samsung ssd\u2019s like T5 and T7. What I going to describe having happened has to do with my red color T7 1TB drive.\n\nI found that it has leaked a small amount of a clear residue.\n\nI have been using two SSDs with my Acer laptop for at least 5 years for storing pretty much everything , including games from Steam.\n\nThe way the 2 USB drives were connected was unfortunately different. The laptop has only one USB C out and a bunch of usb 3.0 outs. The red t7 was connected mostly on the usb 3.0.\n\nOne day when I was reconnecting the drives to the laptop after using them on desktop I noticed that along the thin line where the outer aluminum body is connected with the sideways panels (one panel has the ucb-c out and the other has text about the drive) there was some dry white color residue.\n\nLater I realized that the red drive which was connected by a usb-3 to usb-c was on much longer because the pc was continuously checking it in the sleep mode. Basically it was on much longer than the other drive. It was never very hot. Just warm. \n\nOver the last 2 years I was using this drive much more rarely due to my frequent use of the desktop. Today when I was cleaning the table under and behind the laptop noticed that it had a layer of transparent stuff on the surface.

What I going to describe having happened has to do with my red color T7 1TB drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found that it has leaked a small amount of a clear residue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been using two SSDs with my Acer laptop for at least 5 years for storing pretty much everything , including games from Steam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way the 2 USB drives were connected was unfortunately different. The laptop has only one USB C out and a bunch of usb 3.0 outs. The red t7 was connected mostly on the usb 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day when I was reconnecting the drives to the laptop after using them on desktop I noticed that along the thin line where the outer aluminum body is connected with the sideways panels (one panel has the ucb-c out and the other has text about the drive) there was some dry white color residue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later I realized that the red drive which was connected by a usb-3 to usb-c was on much longer because the pc was continuously checking it in the sleep mode. Basically it was on much longer than the other drive. It was never very hot. Just warm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 years I was using this drive much more rarely due to my frequent use of the desktop. Today when I was cleaning the table under and behind the laptop noticed that it had a layer of transparent stuff on the surface. Felt very similar to candle wax when touched but transparent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could not figure out what it was then I saw that it was next to the drive and basically connected the dots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two questions.

Let me explain.\n\nEach of us has NAS/Servers, and these servers have a 3-2-1 strategy thanks to (this subreddit too) my work configuring Borg Backup and Borgmatic. This is a wonderful combination of software, I already donated to each of them, because they are simply great.\n\nSo back to Windows: we keep files on our PCs for convenience which need to be backed up.\n\nIn the good old days we used to use Windows File History. It's garbage, basically has no features other than being integrated in Windows, and easy restore through concept of *let's go back back in time.* No deduplication, in fact many duplicate files!\n\nDo you have a solid software you can recommend? Here's what I considered so far:\n\n\\- Borg is unfortunately not (seriously) available for Windows, otherwise would be my go-to.\n\n\\- [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/) has been in beta since ages and last time I used it was highly unreliable\n\n\\- [Kopia](https://kopia.io/) Simple and fast, easy to navigate GUI.

Which of course they didn't do so when I finally brought it to Australia four years ago I had to source another PSU.\n\nAt the time I kinda gave up on the system and put it in a closet, building another [NAS](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/builds/edit/?userbuild=QqWbt6) instead (now with [upgrades](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/ypMRz6)) - was never sure if the issues I was having was the replacement power supply I'd sourced not being quite right, or if just the ageing [Jetway JNC92-330 Dual Core 1.6GHz Atom Mini-ITX Motherboard](https://www.jetwaycomputer.com/NC92.html) it's raid daughterboard - at any rate finding a replacement ITX system that could fit a thermal solution in the small chassis section seemed unlikely at the time so just popped in the closet and it's been sat there since whilst I enjoyed my new NAS.\n\nNow though, a friend is in need of a system, and as I've just upgraded my NAS I have four perfectly good 4tb drives laying around, and this case so picked up a more modern board from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006221619148.html) that looked like it'd meet the needs of the case and with the addition of a spare ssd for cache and an OS drive would do my friend just fine.\n\nI got this put together last night, truenas installed and running, but, have a bit of an odd issue.\n\n\\--- problem 1 ---\n\nInitially I did an out of case test (sans drives), everything on the motherboard ran fine, so popped everything in and it wouldn't switch on. Damn. I first thought may be the newer drives and board type were too much power draw, so pulled the drives and it booted.\n\nThis seemed to confirm my worry on power, so I started to test how many drives could I get away with, where things got interesting.\n\nTurns out it's just one of the drives it doesn't like. I can have one, two or three of the other drives connected, or none at all, but as soon as I connect the drive (hot swap) the system powers down. If the systems is off, won't power on - the green power light on the external brick goes out.\n\nTried it in multiple bays too, so it's not the backplane for that drive. There's no visual damage to the drive and all four were working fine in my [NAS](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/builds/edit/?userbuild=QqWbt6) previously.\n\n\\--- problem 2 ---\n\nThe four drives originally two were \"picked up\" from work, the other two I purchased, so although they're all 4tb WD Red's they're two different revisions, you can see in the drive info in truenas that drives I have two of one type and one of the other (given I can't plug in the fourth above). Creating a storage pool with what I have (just to try out true nas, even in my gimped system, figured it was a chance to poke the tyre of it as I've not used it before, but seemed a good fit for my friend) it won't add the second of the three drives.\n\nSays it can't write to it, don't have permissions.\n\nIt's one of the two identical versions though, as my first thought is it could be the drive revisions it didn't like, one knocks out the system, the other works but not enough, but now I have one of each drive type working in a storage pool and one drive I don't have permissions to write to (for some reason, even though this is a clean install with nothing else changed) and one drive I simply can't physically connect.\n\n\\--- final thoughts ---\n\nAs I opened with, not giving myself a great chance here using a fifteen year old case with somewhat questionable external power brick and adding a dodgy chinese motherboard to the mix isn't exactly going to add confidence, but hoping folks might've come across something like the drive issue before and could advise? The system has in the past run four drives, so that's fine, my initial build were 4x2TB WD Greens when I first built it and they ran fine for five years before I emigrated (didn't bother wasting the weight of the drives when bringing the system over given their size was now paltry by the shifting standards).\n\nThough, more likely, I'm hoping someone's come across the true nas issue and that's more a software issue than hardware (as I could see a potential hardware issue preventing writing and truenas simply stating it's permissions when it's unable to adjust the drive? - at a guess).\n\nOne thing that's occurred to me whilst writing this (at work, so can't test till tonight) is bypassing the backplane and plugging the drive in directly to the motherboard (and may be externally powering it) - it was 2am when I gave up on it last night, so that might rule something out.\n\nAppreciate I'm probably wasting time trying to get this work, even if I can get it on it's feet, I don't think I'd feel confident enough to give it to my friend and that I wouldn't be stuck doing text support (from over a state away as they're moving to Melbourne in March), but, having built systems for two decades, I'd like to at least work out the issue as that'll bug me more than anything.", "author_fullname": "t2_5720w", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "System shuts down when disk inserted (and true nas can't see a second disk)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "troubleshooting", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_194f9yh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Troubleshooting", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1705014046.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll preface this with I appreciate the solution is probably don&amp;#39;t use a fifteen year old base for the system - but, hopefully, we can work out what&amp;#39;s up and prevent some e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--- backstory ---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/black-chenbro-es34069-bk-180/p/N82E16811123128\"&gt;Chenbro ES34069 Mini-ITX Home Server/NAS Chassis&lt;/a&gt; which I picked up about a decade and a half ago and used for about five years before I emigrated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really love the design of this little box, four hotswap bays and a compact section to house an ITX board, although the airflow design leaves a lot to be desired by modern standards, it really is a great design for a NAS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d left it with my parents when I emigrated half a world away with specific instructions to keep the external power brick with it, as it&amp;#39;s kinda unusual and would be hard to replace. Which of course they didn&amp;#39;t do so when I finally brought it to Australia four years ago I had to source another PSU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I kinda gave up on the system and put it in a closet, building another &lt;a href=\"https://au.pcpartpicker.com/builds/edit/?userbuild=QqWbt6\"&gt;NAS&lt;/a&gt; instead (now with &lt;a href=\"https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/ypMRz6\"&gt;upgrades&lt;/a&gt;) - was never sure if the issues I was having was the replacement power supply I&amp;#39;d sourced not being quite right, or if just the ageing &lt;a href=\"https://www.jetwaycomputer.com/NC92.html\"&gt;Jetway JNC92-330 Dual Core 1.6GHz Atom Mini-ITX Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#39;s raid daughterboard - at any rate finding a replacement ITX system that could fit a thermal solution in the small chassis section seemed unlikely at the time so just popped in the closet and it&amp;#39;s been sat there since whilst I enjoyed my new NAS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now though, a friend is in need of a system, and as I&amp;#39;ve just upgraded my NAS I have four perfectly good 4tb drives laying around, and this case so picked up a more modern board from &lt;a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006221619148.html\"&gt;AliExpress&lt;/a&gt; that looked like it&amp;#39;d meet the needs of the case and with the addition of a spare ssd for cache and an OS drive would do my friend just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got this put together last night, truenas installed and running, but, have a bit of an odd issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--- problem 1 ---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially I did an out of case test (sans drives), everything on the motherboard ran fine, so popped everything in and it wouldn&amp;#39;t switch on. Damn. I first thought may be the newer drives and board type were too much power draw, so pulled the drives and it booted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seemed to confirm my worry on power, so I started to test how many drives could I get away with, where things got interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out it&amp;#39;s just one of the drives it doesn&amp;#39;t like. I can have one, two or three of the other drives connected, or none at all, but as soon as I connect the drive (hot swap) the system powers down. If the systems is off, won&amp;#39;t power on - the green power light on the external brick goes out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tried it in multiple bays too, so it&amp;#39;s not the backplane for that drive. There&amp;#39;s no visual damage to the drive and all four were working fine in my &lt;a href=\"https://au.pcpartpicker.com/builds/edit/?userbuild=QqWbt6\"&gt;NAS&lt;/a&gt; previously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--- problem 2 ---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The four drives originally two were &amp;quot;picked up&amp;quot; from work, the other two I purchased, so although they&amp;#39;re all 4tb WD Red&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re two different revisions, you can see in the drive info in truenas that drives I have two of one type and one of the other (given I can&amp;#39;t plug in the fourth above).
