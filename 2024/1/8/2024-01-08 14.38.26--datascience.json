Here's how it works:\n\n* Ask an exploratory question or describe your a transformation.\n* Computron classifies and displays the request as a QUERY or TRANSFORMATION.\n* Computron writes and executes code to return the result of the QUERY or to carry out the TRANSFORMATION.\n\nKeep in mind that a QUERY doesn't transform the underlying data, and thus it won't be included in code that gets compiled when you save an automation. Also, right now I'm still figuring out the best way to support plotting requests -- for now the results of a QUERY will just be saved into a csv.

What should I do and how ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi there, and sorry in advance for the rant.\n\nAlmost 4 months ago I started my first job after my engineering degree (MSc). I got hired by an ascending consulting agency, with a very strong data science division in western europe. It's overall a good company, I can do as much as WFH as I want (but I still go to the office at least once a week, people are cool), the salary is 5-10% higher than average for where I live (higher end of average). The culture is okay I guess, if you consider that it's a consulting agency, and the turnover is actually quite low for the field (close to 3 years).\n\nDuring the recruitment process, I told them that I didn't want to go to the main offices. My reasons were personnal, and they said no problem, they needed people on the secondary offices since they want to develop them. Awesome.\n\nBut here am I, almost 4 months later, and I haven't had a single real Data Science mission with a client. I mean, if you exclude the 1 week assignment where I had to properly format a small disgusting excel database, where only 50% of the work was done in python and the rest manually (no other choice).\n\nI'm starting to stagnate. I've been trying to be as active as I can, doing internal work, consulting work: responding to call for tenders and some internal qualitative stuff. None of real Data Science, not even cleansing, no modelling, no front/backend programming for a webapp or small platform, no analyzing or visualization, nothing. I'm going mad, I'm losing all motivation to do work.\n\nLast news I got was during the end of my trial period a month ago where I had an interview with a director. He said they wanted to keep me since I was very proactive and efficient in my work and the client that I worked for a week was extremely happy. But he also acknowledge that given the current market situation they were having trouble with finding new missions for juniors, he excused himself about not giving me a real project and told me they were going to work on it in january.\n\nThe problem is that if I'm losing all motivation to work, then it makes no sense, the job isn't right. Maybe I'm just a big crybaby and that's the same everywhere, because, to make it simple, without this issue, it would be a perfect job with perfect work conditions, close to perfect salary (for me) and in a perfect location.\n\nWhat the hell should I do ?\n\nI'm sure some people will tell me to work on myself during work hours, but if I do that, then my 1 year evaluation will be terrible since I won't have done any internal work, so I won't evolve in grade neither in pay, which sucks. I come from a modest background and have a small student loan to pay.\n\nAnd if I do that, what should I do ? What should I work on and how ? Books, coding, theoretical  knowledge ?\n\nPs: The market sucks right now, so if I do this, I'm scared of not finding another job if they fire me. To be fair it's extremely hard to fire an employee here without major faults, so as long I as work a bit, they shouldn't be able to without giving me a severance package.
