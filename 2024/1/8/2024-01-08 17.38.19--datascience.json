It is serious in the parts that matter like Data Structures &amp; Alg which you need to leetcode (or change into another post-grad program like OMSCS), it also has alot of the intermediate statistics an analyst needs.\n\nIt also follows Introduction to Statistical Learning, but some of the lectures are really shallow. Sometimes the presenter especially for the Supervised Learning one made me wanna sleep. I ended up just reading the textbook and doing the assignments.\n\nPros:\n\n* Very good conversion masters if you were just a basic programmer\n* Assignments are challenging &amp; sweaty\n* You can ramp up/down courses easily\n* Extremely flexible. Good for people who have unstable working hours (me).\n* Data Structures &amp; Algorithms was good. Some of the topics like P/NP etc were not even covered back in my home universty's version of the course.\n* Very impressive support.\n* Very impressive support (x2). Can't emphasize this enough.\n\nCons:\n\n* Their subreddit is not vibrant like OMSCS/OMSA\n* Complex topics are taught in a shallow manner (Machine Learning lectures), but it's of the same depth as other conversion masters. The assignments still pack quite a punch though.\n* Course catalogue is not up to standard like UT Austin / OMSCS in terms of depth. No network science. No time-series.\n\nProgram is very clearly catered for those that have \\*some\\* programming experience and need just enough to be job ready. It's like giving a miner his first shovel, so he can dig, earn and get a bigger shovel. Just to start the ball rolling.\n\n\\--\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI haven't seen anyone do an in-depth review of CU Boulder's MSDS. I will give you a brief rundown.\n\nJust enough information, I am currently working in the data space and have hired people whom have taken conversion masters before. Some of the people whom had taken these conversion masters come from one of the top &lt;15 non-US CS schools (there aren't many, you can check rankings).\n\nSo with that, I have a grasp of largely what these schools teach with regards to their on-campus conversion masters and their syllabus.\n\nIt's pretty late where I am, so I will be updating this post as questions roll in and get straight to the point. I am quite in the trenches of the program and largely understood what is occuring. The courses I've taken ranges from Data Structures, Linear Programming, Machine Learning, Statistical Inference etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I. Introduction to Program**\n\n*\"The online Master of Science degree\u00a0in Data Science  (MS-DS) is an interdisciplinary\u00a0degree program offered\u00a0through the  University of Colorado Boulder\u00a0and hosted online through Coursera\u2019s  learning platform. With performance-based admissions and no application  process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of  undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer  science, information science, mathematics, and statistics.\" -* [*https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/coursera-overview*](https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/coursera-overview)\n\n**II. Program Overview**\n\n***How to get in?***\n\n\"*Performance-based admissions*\n\n*Enroll right away into a series of 3 one-credit pathway courses with a  focus on either statistics or computer science. Complete your pathway  with a GPA of 3.0 or better to be admitted to the program, all while  making direct progress toward your degree. No transcripts or  applications are required.*\"\n\n\\--\n\nI've initially had my ***\\*HEAVY\\**** suspicions on this. But dear god. The assignments were managable but sweaty. When they said that the take home exam may take a few hours, they weren't kidding. For Data Structures they weren't holding their punches.\n\n**III. Curriculum and Courses**\n\nAs opposed to traditional schools that have 3 Semesters a year, CU Boulder has 6, of which it is due to the breaking up of traditional 3 credit courses into 1 credit bits.\n\nNow I know that these are 1 credit courses, but I am gonna bundle them up so that it's easier on everyone. Just going to list afew:\n\n* **Data Structures &amp; Algorithmns** \\- Approximation Algorithms, Linear Programming\n* **Data Mining** \\- Pipeline, Methods, Project\n* **Databases -** Relational Database, SQL\n* **Statistical Inference** \\- Probability Theory, Statistical Estimation, Hypothesis Testing\n* **Statistical Modeling** \\- Modern Regression in R, ANOVA &amp; Experimental Design, Generalized Linear Modelsand Nonparametric Regression\n* **Machine Learning** \\- Supervised, Unsupervised, Deep Learning\n* **Vital Skills for Data Scientist** \\- Ethics, Cyber Security, Data Visualization\n\n\\--\n\nThe courses overlap between the MSDS and MSCS one quite a fair bit, so here are the links to both for you to see.\n\nMSDS Sheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-ThRG-mxo1okBKqPewK8sEgGUQmyOcMDxdKX0S0sTk/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-ThRG-mxo1okBKqPewK8sEgGUQmyOcMDxdKX0S0sTk/edit#gid=0)\n\nMSCS Sheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lplPW\\_5DI-wgB\\_q6qgxmr9WTP12-JVV\\_yDXsKxLFMiM/edit#gid=1698402210](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lplPW_5DI-wgB_q6qgxmr9WTP12-JVV_yDXsKxLFMiM/edit#gid=1698402210)\n\n**IV. Examination?**\n\nIt is a mix between Proctored exams (Honorlock), Take-home assignments and Peer-reviewed projects. What exam types will depend on the courses you take. See the link above.\n\nHow this works is that you will have all of the course materials available to you.\n\n***What is the difference between a paying student and a non-paying student for the courses?***\n\nAccess to the exam/ Final project. That's more or less it. That is for you to get your academic grade.\n\n**V. Student Support Services (Good)**\n\nImpressive (at least for me).\n\nAs someone who has hectic hours (family/work), being able to send a list of questions via email to a single email address, they will route it to whichever TA that is responsible.\n\nUsually my questions (the list of them) come back to me within a day. Which is very good especially when I can't attend office hours.\n\nYou even get a buff card if you are willing to pay and attend graduation ceremony.\n\n**VI. Concerns**\n\nWhile I know this applies to even GaTech, some of the lecture videos need to be redone. Machine Learning particularly.\n\nThere is also a lacking in in-depth lectures. Which is most-possibly not the direction the CU Boulder MSDS program is mean't to be going.\n\nSome in-depth datascience topics like State-Space Models, Markov Chains, Network Science or fun courses like Georgia tech's Machine Learning for Trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VII. Overall Experience (So far)**\n\nOverall this MSDS serves a very particular function. Which is quite telling after awhile.\n\nIt is targetting busy people by giving them the flexibility that GaTech/UT does not have, giving people who had a somewhat weak-STEM education a solid foundation.\n\nThat is all this does, which is to give a solid foundation from which you can jump up to.\n\nAdvanced topics need to be self-studied. Thankfully OMSCS lectures are online and so is their syllabus which I watch/read on the side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll be frank, I did think about OMSCS, pestered my other half many times.\n\nMy wife doesn't want me hidding in my room for 3 years if I took GeorgiaTech's OMSCS. The flexibility of the program is really the selling point for her...***ahem***... me.\n\nHappy wife is happy life.\n\n\\--\n\n**FAQ: (Will update as comments come in)**\n\n**1.How is the slack channel?**\n\nProbably less noisy than OMSCS, but everyone is largely helpful.\n\n**2. How has employers reacted to your resume?**\n\nInternational employers actually reacted to it quite well. They know where colorado is. They know what data science means. But they know it's not Georgia Tech, Carnnegie Mellon etc.\n\nIt gets you pass the HR-filter. But after that it's all you at behavioural and technical interviews.\n\n**3. Why did you choose this over OMSCS?**\n\nFlexibility. Really need it. It's also a much more sustainable path for me to get a MSDS. If I took OMSCS and if life strikes, I may not be able to ramp down when needed fast.\n\nIt helps.\n\n**4. What do you mean by off-ramp and up-ramp?**\n\nI tend to 'upgrade' to for-credit when I am quite sure my work/family schedule is stable. That way I can go through the semester, still have e-mail support and only pay when I am ready for the exams.\n\n**5.  What do you wish they would improve upon?**\n\nQuite a number of the MSCS courses have the depth in terms of algorithms, especially Linear programming and the upcoming courses still in progress.\n\nBut I really wish they'd redo Machine Learning. Some lecturers are not good orators.\n\nAlso I really hope they'd add more interesting electives down the line. But worse case, I'll have to refer to OMSCS lectures and their textbook to supplement my learning and close the knowledge-gap.\n\n**6. How are the assignments?**\n\nChallenging. Despite some of the quality issues with the lecture slides, the programming assignments do have substance.\n\nThere was a comment on OMSCS that redditor tried to do DSA, but commented it was too difficult and they gave up. There is certainly substance in the assignments they made.\n\n**7. Any other reasons why you chose the program?**\n\nI came from a pseudo-STEM background that is not conventional. Think vague degrees like Management or something. I had some parts of Stats, some parts of math, some parts of coding, but none of the \"traditional\" mods.\n\nI actually came here just for Data Structures &amp; Algorithms at first to tick the box of having \"formal programming education\". But ended up quite liking it.", "author_fullname": "t2_58z60nva", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "CU Boulder's MSDS. A Review.

Can&amp;#39;t emphasize this enough.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their subreddit is not vibrant like OMSCS/OMSA&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complex topics are taught in a shallow manner (Machine Learning lectures), but it&amp;#39;s of the same depth as other conversion masters. The assignments still pack quite a punch though.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Course catalogue is not up to standard like UT Austin / OMSCS in terms of depth. No network science. No time-series.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Program is very clearly catered for those that have *some* programming experience and need just enough to be job ready. It&amp;#39;s like giving a miner his first shovel, so he can dig, earn and get a bigger shovel. Just to start the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen anyone do an in-depth review of CU Boulder&amp;#39;s MSDS. I will give you a brief rundown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just enough information, I am currently working in the data space and have hired people whom have taken conversion masters before. Some of the people whom had taken these conversion masters come from one of the top &amp;lt;15 non-US CS schools (there aren&amp;#39;t many, you can check rankings).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with that, I have a grasp of largely what these schools teach with regards to their on-campus conversion masters and their syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty late where I am, so I will be updating this post as questions roll in and get straight to the point. I am quite in the trenches of the program and largely understood what is occuring. The courses I&amp;#39;ve taken ranges from Data Structures, Linear Programming, Machine Learning, Statistical Inference etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Introduction to Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The online Master of Science degree\u00a0in Data Science  (MS-DS) is an interdisciplinary\u00a0degree program offered\u00a0through the  University of Colorado Boulder\u00a0and hosted online through Coursera\u2019s  learning platform. With performance-based admissions and no application  process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of  undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer  science, information science, mathematics, and statistics.&amp;quot; -&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/coursera-overview\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/coursera-overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to get in?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Performance-based admissions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enroll right away into a series of 3 one-credit pathway courses with a  focus on either statistics or computer science. Complete your pathway  with a GPA of 3.0 or better to be admitted to the program, all while  making direct progress toward your degree. No transcripts or  applications are required.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve initially had my &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;HEAVY\\&lt;/strong&gt;** suspicions on this. But dear god. The assignments were managable but sweaty. When they said that the take home exam may take a few hours, they weren&amp;#39;t kidding. For Data Structures they weren&amp;#39;t holding their punches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Curriculum and Courses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As opposed to traditional schools that have 3 Semesters a year, CU Boulder has 6, of which it is due to the breaking up of traditional 3 credit courses into 1 credit bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I know that these are 1 credit courses, but I am gonna bundle them up so that it&amp;#39;s easier on everyone. Just going to list afew:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithmns&lt;/strong&gt; - Approximation Algorithms, Linear Programming&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Mining&lt;/strong&gt; - Pipeline, Methods, Project&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Databases -&lt;/strong&gt; Relational Database, SQL&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Inference&lt;/strong&gt; - Probability Theory, Statistical Estimation, Hypothesis Testing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Modeling&lt;/strong&gt; - Modern Regression in R, ANOVA &amp;amp; Experimental Design, Generalized Linear Modelsand Nonparametric Regression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt; - Supervised, Unsupervised, Deep Learning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vital Skills for Data Scientist&lt;/strong&gt; - Ethics, Cyber Security, Data Visualization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The courses overlap between the MSDS and MSCS one quite a fair bit, so here are the links to both for you to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MSDS Sheet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-ThRG-mxo1okBKqPewK8sEgGUQmyOcMDxdKX0S0sTk/edit#gid=0\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-ThRG-mxo1okBKqPewK8sEgGUQmyOcMDxdKX0S0sTk/edit#gid=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MSCS Sheet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lplPW_5DI-wgB_q6qgxmr9WTP12-JVV_yDXsKxLFMiM/edit#gid=1698402210\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lplPW_5DI-wgB_q6qgxmr9WTP12-JVV_yDXsKxLFMiM/edit#gid=1698402210&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. Examination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a mix between Proctored exams (Honorlock), Take-home assignments and Peer-reviewed projects. What exam types will depend on the courses you take. See the link above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How this works is that you will have all of the course materials available to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the difference between a paying student and a non-paying student for the courses?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Access to the exam/ Final project. That&amp;#39;s more or less it. That is for you to get your academic grade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V. Student Support Services (Good)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impressive (at least for me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who has hectic hours (family/work), being able to send a list of questions via email to a single email address, they will route it to whichever TA that is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually my questions (the list of them) come back to me within a day. Which is very good especially when I can&amp;#39;t attend office hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You even get a buff card if you are willing to pay and attend graduation ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VI. Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I know this applies to even GaTech, some of the lecture videos need to be redone. Machine Learning particularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also a lacking in in-depth lectures. Which is most-possibly not the direction the CU Boulder MSDS program is mean&amp;#39;t to be going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some in-depth datascience topics like State-Space Models, Markov Chains, Network Science or fun courses like Georgia tech&amp;#39;s Machine Learning for Trading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VII. Overall Experience (So far)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall this MSDS serves a very particular function. Which is quite telling after awhile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is targetting busy people by giving them the flexibility that GaTech/UT does not have, giving people who had a somewhat weak-STEM education a solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is all this does, which is to give a solid foundation from which you can jump up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced topics need to be self-studied. Thankfully OMSCS lectures are online and so is their syllabus which I watch/read on the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be frank, I did think about OMSCS, pestered my other half many times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife doesn&amp;#39;t want me hidding in my room for 3 years if I took GeorgiaTech&amp;#39;s OMSCS. The flexibility of the program is really the selling point for her...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;... me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy wife is happy life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQ: (Will update as comments come in)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.How is the slack channel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably less noisy than OMSCS, but everyone is largely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. How has employers reacted to your resume?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;International employers actually reacted to it quite well. They know where colorado is. They know what data science means. But they know it&amp;#39;s not Georgia Tech, Carnnegie Mellon etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets you pass the HR-filter. But after that it&amp;#39;s all you at behavioural and technical interviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Why did you choose this over OMSCS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flexibility. Really need it. It&amp;#39;s also a much more sustainable path for me to get a MSDS. If I took OMSCS and if life strikes, I may not be able to ramp down when needed fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you mean by off-ramp and up-ramp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tend to &amp;#39;upgrade&amp;#39; to for-credit when I am quite sure my work/family schedule is stable. That way I can go through the semester, still have e-mail support and only pay when I am ready for the exams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.  What do you wish they would improve upon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite a number of the MSCS courses have the depth in terms of algorithms, especially Linear programming and the upcoming courses still in progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I really wish they&amp;#39;d redo Machine Learning. Some lecturers are not good orators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I really hope they&amp;#39;d add more interesting electives down the line. But worse case, I&amp;#39;ll have to refer to OMSCS lectures and their textbook to supplement my learning and close the knowledge-gap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. How are the assignments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Challenging. Despite some of the quality issues with the lecture slides, the programming assignments do have substance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a comment on OMSCS that redditor tried to do DSA, but commented it was too difficult and they gave up. There is certainly substance in the assignments they made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Any other reasons why you chose the program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came from a pseudo-STEM background that is not conventional. Think vague degrees like Management or something. I had some parts of Stats, some parts of math, some parts of coding, but none of the &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; mods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually came here just for Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms at first to tick the box of having &amp;quot;formal programming education&amp;quot;. But ended up quite liking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#1a1a1b", "id": "191pneh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GloxyVI", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/191pneh/cu_boulders_msds_a_review_honest/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/191pneh/cu_boulders_msds_a_review_honest/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1234256, "created_utc": 1704732667.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hello folks, \n\nIf one does not have a PhD will there be a glass ceiling in terms of job position within a company?\n\nI know the answer would probably be company-specific but based your biased (but nonetheless insightful) experience does that glass ceiling exist?\n\nI'm specifically asking for the context where one has a Bsc degree in X and a master's degree in Data Science (or a strongly related field)\n\nI know that the field has evolved tremendously over the years.

I'm depressed doing meaningless consultant tasks despite the good working conditions. What should I do and how ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi there, and sorry in advance for the rant.\n\nAlmost 4 months ago I started my first job after my engineering degree (MSc). I got hired by an ascending consulting agency, with a very strong data science division in western europe. It's overall a good company, I can do as much as WFH as I want (but I still go to the office at least once a week, people are cool), the salary is 5-10% higher than average for where I live (higher end of average). The culture is okay I guess, if you consider that it's a consulting agency, and the turnover is actually quite low for the field (close to 3 years).\n\nDuring the recruitment process, I told them that I didn't want to go to the main offices. My reasons were personnal, and they said no problem, they needed people on the secondary offices since they want to develop them. Awesome.\n\nBut here am I, almost 4 months later, and I haven't had a single real Data Science mission with a client. I mean, if you exclude the 1 week assignment where I had to properly format a small disgusting excel database, where only 50% of the work was done in python and the rest manually (no other choice).\n\nI'm starting to stagnate. I've been trying to be as active as I can, doing internal work, consulting work: responding to call for tenders and some internal qualitative stuff. None of real Data Science, not even cleansing, no modelling, no front/backend programming for a webapp or small platform, no analyzing or visualization, nothing. I'm going mad, I'm losing all motivation to do work.\n\nLast news I got was during the end of my trial period a month ago where I had an interview with a director. He said they wanted to keep me since I was very proactive and efficient in my work and the client that I worked for a week was extremely happy. But he also acknowledge that given the current market situation they were having trouble with finding new missions for juniors, he excused himself about not giving me a real project and told me they were going to work on it in january.\n\nThe problem is that if I'm losing all motivation to work, then it makes no sense, the job isn't right. Maybe I'm just a big crybaby and that's the same everywhere, because, to make it simple, without this issue, it would be a perfect job with perfect work conditions, close to perfect salary (for me) and in a perfect location.\n\nWhat the hell should I do ?\n\nI'm sure some people will tell me to work on myself during work hours, but if I do that, then my 1 year evaluation will be terrible since I won't have done any internal work, so I won't evolve in grade neither in pay, which sucks. I come from a modest background and have a small student loan to pay.\n\nAnd if I do that, what should I do ? What should I work on and how ? Books, coding, theoretical  knowledge ?\n\nPs: The market sucks right now, so if I do this, I'm scared of not finding another job if they fire me. To be fair it's extremely hard to fire an employee here without major faults, so as long I as work a bit, they shouldn't be able to without giving me a severance package.

I&amp;#39;ve been trying to be as active as I can, doing internal work, consulting work: responding to call for tenders and some internal qualitative stuff. None of real Data Science, not even cleansing, no modelling, no front/backend programming for a webapp or small platform, no analyzing or visualization, nothing. I&amp;#39;m going mad, I&amp;#39;m losing all motivation to do work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last news I got was during the end of my trial period a month ago where I had an interview with a director. He said they wanted to keep me since I was very proactive and efficient in my work and the client that I worked for a week was extremely happy. But he also acknowledge that given the current market situation they were having trouble with finding new missions for juniors, he excused himself about not giving me a real project and told me they were going to work on it in january.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that if I&amp;#39;m losing all motivation to work, then it makes no sense, the job isn&amp;#39;t right. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just a big crybaby and that&amp;#39;s the same everywhere, because, to make it simple, without this issue, it would be a perfect job with perfect work conditions, close to perfect salary (for me) and in a perfect location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the hell should I do ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure some people will tell me to work on myself during work hours, but if I do that, then my 1 year evaluation will be terrible since I won&amp;#39;t have done any internal work, so I won&amp;#39;t evolve in grade neither in pay, which sucks. I come from a modest background and have a small student loan to pay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if I do that, what should I do ? What should I work on and how ? Books, coding, theoretical  knowledge ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps: The market sucks right now, so if I do this, I&amp;#39;m scared of not finding another job if they fire me. To be fair it&amp;#39;s extremely hard to fire an employee here without major faults, so as long I as work a bit, they shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to without giving me a severance package. But it also goes against my values to &amp;quot;quiet quit&amp;quot;, so there&amp;#39;s that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b026063c-d780-11e7-aba9-0e030591a4b4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "id": "191haic", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chacalgamer", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/191haic/europe_almost_4_months_in_my_first_data_science/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/191haic/europe_almost_4_months_in_my_first_data_science/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1234256, "created_utc": 1704705909.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": " \n\nWelcome to this week's entering &amp; transitioning thread!
