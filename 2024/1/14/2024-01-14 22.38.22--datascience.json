I have access to past plans and currently active plans, so I am able to aggregate these in some form for churn/retention analysis. I also have customer data (demographics,appointments at our dealers, etc), and general car information. I have access to which customers we attempted contact(through ads on social media,email, or calls) regarding renewal of plan; dont have whether they actually responded or clicked the ad. We have split the country into different regions too for contacting customers, so breaking it down by region is something I am thinking of.\n\nHere are a few things I have thought of doing:\n\n1. basic statistical analysis, like summary stats; overall churn rate vs region by region vs churn on customer segmentation( customer segmentation might tougher to do due to multiple households)\n\n2)ML based churn prediction\n\nI have a feeling that the features we have might not be too predictive here. Perhaps attempted contact could also be a feature. I am also not sure if seasonality could play here.\n\n3) Somehow incorporate survival analysis here(I've covered SA in coursework, not completely sure how to fit it in, whether I should use multiple groups, and if so, which groups, etc)\n\nI am constrained with the data I have; since its not some official project, I can't necessarily get access to more data, such as who has responded. I can't do any new interventions myself here either, like some sort of AB test.\n\n\\-----------\n\nAnd then on related note, I am thinking the same could be done wrt to data on customers to their first dealership appointment after a new purchase; I think I could use similar ideas such\n\nas basic statistical analysis, some ML prediction, and/or survival analysis.\n\nI am curious about any suggestions/feedback anyone has on these ideas( or any suggestions for something else that can be done on this data given constraints).

I have access to a wealth of data, and have been starting some side projects on the data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of some churn related analysis/predictions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our customers get a plan with new car purchase.plan lasts 3-4 years, and they can renew it. I have access to past plans and currently active plans, so I am able to aggregate these in some form for churn/retention analysis. I also have customer data (demographics,appointments at our dealers, etc), and general car information. I have access to which customers we attempted contact(through ads on social media,email, or calls) regarding renewal of plan; dont have whether they actually responded or clicked the ad. We have split the country into different regions too for contacting customers, so breaking it down by region is something I am thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things I have thought of doing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;basic statistical analysis, like summary stats; overall churn rate vs region by region vs churn on customer segmentation( customer segmentation might tougher to do due to multiple households)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)ML based churn prediction&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that the features we have might not be too predictive here. Perhaps attempted contact could also be a feature. I am also not sure if seasonality could play here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Somehow incorporate survival analysis here(I&amp;#39;ve covered SA in coursework, not completely sure how to fit it in, whether I should use multiple groups, and if so, which groups, etc)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am constrained with the data I have; since its not some official project, I can&amp;#39;t necessarily get access to more data, such as who has responded. I can&amp;#39;t do any new interventions myself here either, like some sort of AB test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then on related note, I am thinking the same could be done wrt to data on customers to their first dealership appointment after a new purchase; I think I could use similar ideas such&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as basic statistical analysis, some ML prediction, and/or survival analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am curious about any suggestions/feedback anyone has on these ideas( or any suggestions for something else that can be done on this data given constraints). And should I keep this as more of an exploratory thing as opposed to having some rigorous plan beforehand, where I have all the goals, techniques, and potential subgroups stated before starting?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "481ee318-d77d-11e7-a4a3-0e8624d7129a", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#7193ff", "id": "1963nbh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Adventurous-Put-8042", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1963nbh/some_suggestions_for_churnretention_related/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1963nbh/some_suggestions_for_churnretention_related/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1247344, "created_utc": 1705195011.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I know last year they would hire straight out of Ph.D\u2019s with a good paper or two.
