It is serious in the parts that matter like Data Structures &amp; Alg which you need to leetcode (or change into another post-grad program like OMSCS), it also has alot of the intermediate statistics an analyst needs.\n\nIt also follows Introduction to Statistical Learning, but some of the lectures are really shallow. Sometimes the presenter especially for the Supervised Learning one made me wanna sleep. I ended up just reading the textbook and doing the assignments.\n\nPros:\n\n* Very good conversion masters if you were just a basic programmer\n* Assignments are challenging &amp; sweaty\n* You can ramp up/down courses easily\n* Extremely flexible. Good for people who have unstable working hours (me).\n* Data Structures &amp; Algorithms was good. Some of the topics like P/NP etc were not even covered back in my home universty's version of the course.\n* Very impressive support.\n* Very impressive support (x2). Can't emphasize this enough.\n\nCons:\n\n* Their subreddit is not vibrant like OMSCS/OMSA\n* Complex topics are taught in a shallow manner (Machine Learning lectures), but it's of the same depth as other conversion masters.

No time-series.\n\nProgram is very clearly catered for those that have \\*some\\* programming experience and need just enough to be job ready.

I will give you a brief rundown.\n\nJust enough information, I am currently working in the data space and have hired people whom have taken conversion masters before. Some of the people whom had taken these conversion masters come from one of the top &lt;15 non-US CS schools (there aren't many, you can check rankings).\n\nSo with that, I have a grasp of largely what these schools teach with regards to their on-campus conversion masters and their syllabus.\n\nIt's pretty late where I am, so I will be updating this post as questions roll in and get straight to the point. I am quite in the trenches of the program and largely understood what is occuring. The courses I've taken ranges from Data Structures, Linear Programming, Machine Learning, Statistical Inference etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I. Introduction to Program**\n\n*\"The online Master of Science degree\u00a0in Data Science  (MS-DS) is an interdisciplinary\u00a0degree program offered\u00a0through the  University of Colorado Boulder\u00a0and hosted online through Coursera\u2019s  learning platform. With performance-based admissions and no application  process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of  undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer  science, information science, mathematics, and statistics.\" -* [*https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/coursera-overview*](https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/coursera-overview)\n\n**II. Program Overview**\n\n***How to get in?***\n\n\"*Performance-based admissions*\n\n*Enroll right away into a series of 3 one-credit pathway courses with a  focus on either statistics or computer science. Complete your pathway  with a GPA of 3.0 or better to be admitted to the program, all while  making direct progress toward your degree. No transcripts or  applications are required.*\"\n\n**Price: $15,750 (About the same as OMSA after factoring all the fees)**\n\n\\--\n\nI've initially had my ***\\*HEAVY\\**** suspicions on this. But dear god. The assignments were managable but sweaty. When they said that the take home exam may take a few hours, they weren't kidding. For Data Structures they weren't holding their punches.\n\n**III. Curriculum and Courses**\n\nAs opposed to traditional schools that have 3 Semesters a year, CU Boulder has 6, of which it is due to the breaking up of traditional 3 credit courses into 1 credit bits.\n\nNow I know that these are 1 credit courses, but I am gonna bundle them up so that it's easier on everyone. Just going to list afew:\n\n* **Data Structures &amp; Algorithmns** \\- Approximation Algorithms, Linear Programming\n* **Data Mining** \\- Pipeline, Methods, Project\n* **Databases -** Relational Database, SQL\n* **Statistical Inference** \\- Probability Theory, Statistical Estimation, Hypothesis Testing\n* **Statistical Modeling** \\- Modern Regression in R, ANOVA &amp; Experimental Design, Generalized Linear Modelsand Nonparametric Regression\n* **Machine Learning** \\- Supervised, Unsupervised, Deep Learning\n* **Vital Skills for Data Scientist** \\- Ethics, Cyber Security, Data Visualization\n\n\\--\n\nThe courses overlap between the MSDS and MSCS one quite a fair bit, so here are the links to both for you to see.\n\nMSDS Sheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-ThRG-mxo1okBKqPewK8sEgGUQmyOcMDxdKX0S0sTk/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-ThRG-mxo1okBKqPewK8sEgGUQmyOcMDxdKX0S0sTk/edit#gid=0)\n\nMSCS Sheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lplPW\\_5DI-wgB\\_q6qgxmr9WTP12-JVV\\_yDXsKxLFMiM/edit#gid=1698402210](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lplPW_5DI-wgB_q6qgxmr9WTP12-JVV_yDXsKxLFMiM/edit#gid=1698402210)\n\n**IV. Examination?**\n\nIt is a mix between Proctored exams (Honorlock), Take-home assignments and Peer-reviewed projects. What exam types will depend on the courses you take. See the link above.\n\nHow this works is that you will have all of the course materials available to you.\n\n***What is the difference between a paying student and a non-paying student for the courses?***\n\nAccess to the exam/ Final project. That's more or less it. That is for you to get your academic grade.\n\n**V. Student Support Services (Good)**\n\nImpressive (at least for me).\n\nAs someone who has hectic hours (family/work), being able to send a list of questions via email to a single email address, they will route it to whichever TA that is responsible.\n\nUsually my questions (the list of them) come back to me within a day. Which is very good especially when I can't attend office hours.\n\nYou even get a buff card if you are willing to pay and attend graduation ceremony.\n\n**VI. Concerns**\n\nWhile I know this applies to even GaTech, some of the lecture videos need to be redone. Machine Learning particularly.\n\nThere is also a lacking in in-depth lectures. Which is most-possibly not the direction the CU Boulder MSDS program is mean't to be going.\n\nSome in-depth datascience topics like State-Space Models, Markov Chains, Network Science or fun courses like Georgia tech's Machine Learning for Trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VII. Overall Experience (So far)**\n\nOverall this MSDS serves a very particular function. Which is quite telling after awhile.\n\nIt is targetting busy people by giving them the flexibility that GaTech/UT does not have, giving people who had a somewhat weak-STEM education a solid foundation.\n\nThat is all this does, which is to give a solid foundation from which you can jump up to.\n\nAdvanced topics need to be self-studied. Thankfully OMSCS lectures are online and so is their syllabus which I watch/read on the side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll be frank, I did think about OMSCS, pestered my other half many times.\n\nMy wife doesn't want me hidding in my room for 3 years if I took GeorgiaTech's OMSCS. The flexibility of the program is really the selling point for her...***ahem***... me.\n\nHappy wife is happy life.\n\n\\--\n\n**FAQ: (Will update as comments come in)**\n\n**1.How is the slack channel?**\n\nProbably less noisy than OMSCS, but everyone is largely helpful.\n\n**2. How has employers reacted to your resume?**\n\nInternational employers actually reacted to it quite well. They know where colorado is. They know what data science means. But they know it's not Georgia Tech, Carnnegie Mellon etc.\n\nIt gets you pass the HR-filter. But after that it's all you at behavioural and technical interviews.\n\n**3. Why did you choose this over OMSCS?**\n\nFlexibility. Really need it. It's also a much more sustainable path for me to get a MSDS. If I took OMSCS and if life strikes, I may not be able to ramp down when needed fast.\n\nIt helps.\n\n**4. What do you mean by off-ramp and up-ramp?**\n\nI tend to 'upgrade' to for-credit when I am quite sure my work/family schedule is stable. That way I can go through the semester, still have e-mail support and only pay when I am ready for the exams.\n\n**5.  What do you wish they would improve upon?**\n\nQuite a number of the MSCS courses have the depth in terms of algorithms, especially Linear programming and the upcoming courses still in progress.\n\nBut I really wish they'd redo Machine Learning. Some lecturers are not good orators.\n\nAlso I really hope they'd add more interesting electives down the line. But worse case, I'll have to refer to OMSCS lectures and their textbook to supplement my learning and close the knowledge-gap.\n\n**6. How are the assignments?**\n\nChallenging. Despite some of the quality issues with the lecture slides, the programming assignments do have substance.\n\nThere was a comment on OMSCS that a redditor tried to do DSA, but commented it was too difficult and they gave up. There is certainly substance in the assignments they made.\n\n**7. Any other reasons why you chose the program?**\n\nI came from a pseudo-STEM background that is not conventional. Think vague degrees like Management or something. I had some parts of Stats, some parts of math, some parts of coding, but none of the \"traditional\" mods.\n\nI actually came here just for Data Structures &amp; Algorithms at first to tick the box of having \"formal programming education\".

Thankfully OMSCS lectures are online and so is their syllabus which I watch/read on the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be frank, I did think about OMSCS, pestered my other half many times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife doesn&amp;#39;t want me hidding in my room for 3 years if I took GeorgiaTech&amp;#39;s OMSCS. The flexibility of the program is really the selling point for her...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;... me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy wife is happy life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQ: (Will update as comments come in)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.How is the slack channel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably less noisy than OMSCS, but everyone is largely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. How has employers reacted to your resume?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;International employers actually reacted to it quite well. They know where colorado is. They know what data science means. But they know it&amp;#39;s not Georgia Tech, Carnnegie Mellon etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets you pass the HR-filter. But after that it&amp;#39;s all you at behavioural and technical interviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Why did you choose this over OMSCS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flexibility. Really need it. It&amp;#39;s also a much more sustainable path for me to get a MSDS. If I took OMSCS and if life strikes, I may not be able to ramp down when needed fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you mean by off-ramp and up-ramp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tend to &amp;#39;upgrade&amp;#39; to for-credit when I am quite sure my work/family schedule is stable. That way I can go through the semester, still have e-mail support and only pay when I am ready for the exams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.  What do you wish they would improve upon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite a number of the MSCS courses have the depth in terms of algorithms, especially Linear programming and the upcoming courses still in progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I really wish they&amp;#39;d redo Machine Learning. Some lecturers are not good orators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I really hope they&amp;#39;d add more interesting electives down the line. But worse case, I&amp;#39;ll have to refer to OMSCS lectures and their textbook to supplement my learning and close the knowledge-gap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. How are the assignments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Challenging. Despite some of the quality issues with the lecture slides, the programming assignments do have substance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a comment on OMSCS that a redditor tried to do DSA, but commented it was too difficult and they gave up. There is certainly substance in the assignments they made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Any other reasons why you chose the program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came from a pseudo-STEM background that is not conventional. Think vague degrees like Management or something. I had some parts of Stats, some parts of math, some parts of coding, but none of the &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; mods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually came here just for Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms at first to tick the box of having &amp;quot;formal programming education&amp;quot;. But ended up quite liking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#1a1a1b", "id": "191pneh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GloxyVI", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 39, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/191pneh/cu_boulders_msds_a_review_honest/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/191pneh/cu_boulders_msds_a_review_honest/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1236221, "created_utc": 1704732667.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I think historically DS was populated by math and statistics people.
