[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/12otxy6/interview_prep_anyone_in_zach_wilsons_data/). So I have seen the posting about a PPP discount based on the country that you live in, since Brazil's economy is kinda crap, I decided to try, if I got I would buy, otherwise maybe think a bit more and try on another opportunity. To my surprise, I was selected! Now I will give you guys my feedback for all the weeks since I got the both tracks course.\n\nIt's important to notice that I have been a Data Engineer for almost 2 years, but never worked on big tech, FAANG, etc. meh experiences, not complete garbage but nothing mind-blowing, know a bit of Scala, worked with Airflow, PySpark, Cloud, Pandas... The classic stuff.\n\nTLDR: Was worth it? Yes. Further, I will point out a few things that made it worth it. Just the knowledge may not be worth it for you.\n\nWeek 1 - Dimensional Data Modeling\n\nThis first week, I believe Zach was extremely motivated to teach, the classes were insightful and focused on data engineering basis, there I fixated on the differences between OLTP and OLAP, and also learned about the existence of Master Data.\n\nThere he points out a lot about **how** you are delivering your data, and the importance of noticing that for each kind of consumer, you may want to prepare the data in different ways.\n\nLearned about additivity on the dimensions, a term that I had never heard before the boot camp, and also about SCD tables, I don't know why, but never heard about this one before too.\n\nWeek 2 - Fact Data Modeling\n\nThis second week Zach was also extremely motivated, I believe these two topics are his favorite, not that he wasn't motivated on the others, but the difference between Week 1 and 2, and the rest was clear. There I also fixated on the difference between a fact and a dimension.\n\nDuring this week Zach taught about techniques for fact tables deduplication, and ways to aggregate fact data into lists or binaries format to get fast analytics.\n\nIt's good to point out that Zach brings a lot of his experience to FAANG-like companies, so some cases will not apply to you probably, but it is nice to know how happens there, this extends to the whole boot camp.\n\nWeek 3 - Analytics Track - Analytical Patterns\n\nHere Zach taught about what kind of patterns to aggregate data would suit better for each type of requirement, for example, what to use when we are looking for root causes, what to use when looking for rankings, etc.\n\nOne insightful class from this week was related to the data engineering interview process (usually on big techs), he told me about what to expect in terms of technical tests, what to pay attention to during the coding interview, tips and tricks for window functions, and there I learned also a new thing that never seen before GROUPING SETS, GROUP BY CUBE and GROUP BY ROLLUP.\n\nWeek 3 - Infrastructure Track - Flink Streaming\n\nI hated this week, not by Zach's fault, but I didn't like streaming, I think it was good knowledge, but certainly not enough time for someone who has never seen that before. I believe that for people like me that never used or seen Flink before, I was only able to digest and understand the theoretical part, like Kappa and Lambda architecture, or the concepts of micro-batch and near real-time, etc.\n\nDuring the labs, we used Flink with Kafka, I have never used both of them, but tbh, I was warned, he says on the requirements sections that for infrastructure track: \"Basic understanding of Docker, Flink, and Kafka.\" So if you want to do the boot camp, try to look just a bit to understand, it will make your life easier.\n\nI discovered that maybe I don't want to work on Uber lol\n\nWeek 4 - Analytics Track - KPIs and Experimentation\n\nThis week Zach taught about leading and lagging metrics, another concept that I have never heard before, and also [Timothy Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trchan/) taught about A/B tests, experimentation, etc. Tim is a nice guy, but the content for me, was boring.\n\nWeek 4 - Infrastructure Track - Spark Batch\n\nHere was one of the most awaited weeks, here Zach covered topics from the basics of Spark theory, so what is a plan, driver, and executor, to JOIN optimizations and tuning. We have seen differences from the caching and broadcasting, as well as Notebooks x Spark Submit. It was nice but maybe expecting something different.\n\nWeek 5 - Analytics Track - Data Quality\n\nHere I can summarize that it was related to the importance of trust in data, and what kind of data quality checks we can use for different cases and each type of table. I used my notion annotations from this class as a cheat sheet to check if I am not missing any type of QA check. Interesting to point out to you guys that he mentioned an Airbnb framework called MIDAS, google it when you have time.\n\nThe second class was presented by a Brazilian fellow that is specialized in dbt, it was interesting, of course, have heard about dbt but never had the opportunity to try it.\n\nAlso here we learned about data design document building, and I liked it.\n\nWeek 5 - Infrastructure Track - Also Data Quality\n\nThis week wasn't anything mind-blowing, but was important, here we discussed about differences between SE testing and DE testing, why they have higher quality standards, why most organizations miss the mark\n\nIn the second part of this week, the Airflow God [Marc Lamberti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclamberti/) caught the reins and gave us a presentation on the theory of data contracts, best practices on data validation, and ways to enhance the data quality, followed by the technical part using Airflow.\n\nWeek 6 - Analytics Track - Visual Impact\n\nHere we had a class where the knowledge there was insightful but not useful for me yet, he discussed challenges and what separates the senior data engineer from the staff data engineer, as a few career insights more related to professionals in higher places of the hierarchy, so not absorbed much in my POV, since I am still kinda a minion.\n\nThe theory behind Dataviz was taught here, it would be like maybe the Week 3 classes being used in real life, very insightful, for those who are looking for analytics engineering, this week is a must.\n\nWeek 6 - Infrastructure Track - Pipeline Maintenance\n\nThis one was maybe even harder to digest than the Flink one for a reason, I never had to schedule maintenance on pipelines, reduce costs, or optimize computing on pipelines yet. This kind of stuff is out of my decision power, so great content, but not applicable to me. He taught about the impact of ownership on projects, the significance of domain knowledge, and effective communication. Another example that he talks about is related to tech debt and data migration, so yeah, I have never had to deal with that, so kind of abstract for me.\n\nI have to point out a few things about this boot camp:\n\n1. I thought the weekly homework would be easy peasy, Udemy quiz-like. I couldn't be more wrong. They are hard and require a lot of time. If you don't mind about the certification and the mentorship program, you don't need to worry about that.\n2. Zach has a discord community for those who are in his boot camp, there you can chat with your peers, Zach, and people from other boot camps, it's nice and helps keep the engagement.\n3. With the boot camp, you gain access to past classes and talks from people who have been there, so you can watch for example the [Joe Reis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/) talk that happened during V3 boot camp.\n4. Weekly is a Career Development Q&amp;A with [Sarah Floris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-floris/), we can ask questions, tips for LinkedIn, etc.\n5. For those who do the homework on time, we have access to a weekly coffee chat with Zach, where we can ask questions for him. Extremely worth it, that was what motivated me the most for doing homework, I could participate in all of them, and it was nice to be on the last one, because the first one had like 80 people, and the last maybe 8, so only the warriors were there.\n6. Access to other classes like LLM-related or 30-minute classes to prepare for technical interviews, like data architecture, data modeling, SQL, and DSA.\n7. In the end, we have a capstone project that we developed by ourselves with a few requirements, fetching all the knowledge, it is a good idea, but this one was too much for me, the due date is on Jan 26th, but I will not be able to finish it, marriage ceremony preparation, masters and other life things are draining too much time for me to dive into that, but I would recommend doing that.\n\nWith those points above I feel that was worth it, it was intense, but I feel grateful for the knowledge. As I said before if you are already a data engineer master, that is the data modeling king, and all the topics that I mentioned you are comfortable with, or at least with most of them, maybe it will not be worth it for you, this boot camp is more suited for someone that already know something, but still need to climb the ladder, so maybe an end junior\\~end mid-level range.\n\nFor the V.4 boot camp, Zach removed from the curricula the pipeline maintenance and dataviz week, but it will be available from my cohort and will be adding a dbt week and an end-to-end Machine Learning week though, to be honest, I am not a big fan of ML and didn't fall in love with dbt, so I would prefer doing my version lol, but I am sure that it will be cool too.\n\nI am sure that on many points Zach is improving the UX of his boot camp, so things that were bad from the V.2 were better on V.3 and the V.4 will be better than mine. I conclude with if you can, do it, but be prepared to dedicate 6 weeks to that, just watching the recorded classes is a waste of an opportunity.\n\nIf you guys have any other questions about the boot camp I am glad to answer them, I know that it is not cheap and you may feel insecure, you can ask here or reach me on DM.", "author_fullname": "t2_xsawr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "My Thoughts on EcZachly/Zach Wilson's Bootcamp V.3", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_19cld0z", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1705899567.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1705891886.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was already hovering over &lt;a href=\"https://dataexpert.io/\"&gt;Zach&amp;#39;s Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; but was a bit insecure since the price was huge and a few not many positive comments on two posts from this subreddit &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/14ieh8u/any_feedback_on_zach_wilsons_data_engineering/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/12otxy6/interview_prep_anyone_in_zach_wilsons_data/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

There I also fixated on the difference between a fact and a dimension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this week Zach taught about techniques for fact tables deduplication, and ways to aggregate fact data into lists or binaries format to get fast analytics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good to point out that Zach brings a lot of his experience to FAANG-like companies, so some cases will not apply to you probably, but it is nice to know how happens there, this extends to the whole boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 3 - Analytics Track - Analytical Patterns&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here Zach taught about what kind of patterns to aggregate data would suit better for each type of requirement, for example, what to use when we are looking for root causes, what to use when looking for rankings, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One insightful class from this week was related to the data engineering interview process (usually on big techs), he told me about what to expect in terms of technical tests, what to pay attention to during the coding interview, tips and tricks for window functions, and there I learned also a new thing that never seen before GROUPING SETS, GROUP BY CUBE and GROUP BY ROLLUP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 3 - Infrastructure Track - Flink Streaming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hated this week, not by Zach&amp;#39;s fault, but I didn&amp;#39;t like streaming, I think it was good knowledge, but certainly not enough time for someone who has never seen that before. I believe that for people like me that never used or seen Flink before, I was only able to digest and understand the theoretical part, like Kappa and Lambda architecture, or the concepts of micro-batch and near real-time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the labs, we used Flink with Kafka, I have never used both of them, but tbh, I was warned, he says on the requirements sections that for infrastructure track: &amp;quot;Basic understanding of Docker, Flink, and Kafka.&amp;quot; So if you want to do the boot camp, try to look just a bit to understand, it will make your life easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered that maybe I don&amp;#39;t want to work on Uber lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 4 - Analytics Track - KPIs and Experimentation&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week Zach taught about leading and lagging metrics, another concept that I have never heard before, and also &lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/trchan/\"&gt;Timothy Chan&lt;/a&gt; taught about A/B tests, experimentation, etc. Tim is a nice guy, but the content for me, was boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 4 - Infrastructure Track - Spark Batch&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here was one of the most awaited weeks, here Zach covered topics from the basics of Spark theory, so what is a plan, driver, and executor, to JOIN optimizations and tuning. We have seen differences from the caching and broadcasting, as well as Notebooks x Spark Submit. It was nice but maybe expecting something different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 5 - Analytics Track - Data Quality&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here I can summarize that it was related to the importance of trust in data, and what kind of data quality checks we can use for different cases and each type of table. I used my notion annotations from this class as a cheat sheet to check if I am not missing any type of QA check. Interesting to point out to you guys that he mentioned an Airbnb framework called MIDAS, google it when you have time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second class was presented by a Brazilian fellow that is specialized in dbt, it was interesting, of course, have heard about dbt but never had the opportunity to try it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also here we learned about data design document building, and I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 5 - Infrastructure Track - Also Data Quality&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week wasn&amp;#39;t anything mind-blowing, but was important, here we discussed about differences between SE testing and DE testing, why they have higher quality standards, why most organizations miss the mark&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the second part of this week, the Airflow God &lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclamberti/\"&gt;Marc Lamberti&lt;/a&gt; caught the reins and gave us a presentation on the theory of data contracts, best practices on data validation, and ways to enhance the data quality, followed by the technical part using Airflow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 6 - Analytics Track - Visual Impact&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we had a class where the knowledge there was insightful but not useful for me yet, he discussed challenges and what separates the senior data engineer from the staff data engineer, as a few career insights more related to professionals in higher places of the hierarchy, so not absorbed much in my POV, since I am still kinda a minion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The theory behind Dataviz was taught here, it would be like maybe the Week 3 classes being used in real life, very insightful, for those who are looking for analytics engineering, this week is a must.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Week 6 - Infrastructure Track - Pipeline Maintenance&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one was maybe even harder to digest than the Flink one for a reason, I never had to schedule maintenance on pipelines, reduce costs, or optimize computing on pipelines yet. This kind of stuff is out of my decision power, so great content, but not applicable to me. He taught about the impact of ownership on projects, the significance of domain knowledge, and effective communication. Another example that he talks about is related to tech debt and data migration, so yeah, I have never had to deal with that, so kind of abstract for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to point out a few things about this boot camp:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I thought the weekly homework would be easy peasy, Udemy quiz-like. I couldn&amp;#39;t be more wrong. They are hard and require a lot of time. If you don&amp;#39;t mind about the certification and the mentorship program, you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zach has a discord community for those who are in his boot camp, there you can chat with your peers, Zach, and people from other boot camps, it&amp;#39;s nice and helps keep the engagement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With the boot camp, you gain access to past classes and talks from people who have been there, so you can watch for example the &lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/\"&gt;Joe Reis&lt;/a&gt; talk that happened during V3 boot camp.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Weekly is a Career Development Q&amp;amp;A with &lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-floris/\"&gt;Sarah Floris&lt;/a&gt;, we can ask questions, tips for LinkedIn, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For those who do the homework on time, we have access to a weekly coffee chat with Zach, where we can ask questions for him. Extremely worth it, that was what motivated me the most for doing homework, I could participate in all of them, and it was nice to be on the last one, because the first one had like 80 people, and the last maybe 8, so only the warriors were there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Access to other classes like LLM-related or 30-minute classes to prepare for technical interviews, like data architecture, data modeling, SQL, and DSA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the end, we have a capstone project that we developed by ourselves with a few requirements, fetching all the knowledge, it is a good idea, but this one was too much for me, the due date is on Jan 26th, but I will not be able to finish it, marriage ceremony preparation, masters and other life things are draining too much time for me to dive into that, but I would recommend doing that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With those points above I feel that was worth it, it was intense, but I feel grateful for the knowledge. As I said before if you are already a data engineer master, that is the data modeling king, and all the topics that I mentioned you are comfortable with, or at least with most of them, maybe it will not be worth it for you, this boot camp is more suited for someone that already know something, but still need to climb the ladder, so maybe an end junior~end mid-level range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the V.4 boot camp, Zach removed from the curricula the pipeline maintenance and dataviz week, but it will be available from my cohort and will be adding a dbt week and an end-to-end Machine Learning week though, to be honest, I am not a big fan of ML and didn&amp;#39;t fall in love with dbt, so I would prefer doing my version lol, but I am sure that it will be cool too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sure that on many points Zach is improving the UX of his boot camp, so things that were bad from the V.2 were better on V.3 and the V.4 will be better than mine. I conclude with if you can, do it, but be prepared to dedicate 6 weeks to that, just watching the recorded classes is a waste of an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you guys have any other questions about the boot camp I am glad to answer them, I know that it is not cheap and you may feel insecure, you can ask here or reach me on DM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "92b74b58-aaca-11eb-b160-0e6181e3773f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "id": "19cld0z", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "abbadb", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 51, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/19cld0z/my_thoughts_on_eczachlyzach_wilsons_bootcamp_v3/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19cld0z/my_thoughts_on_eczachlyzach_wilsons_bootcamp_v3/", "subreddit_subscribers": 154857, "created_utc": 1705891886.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "I see arguments from time to time that it\u2019s fine going straight into using spark, airflow, highly available rdbms, advanced git vc architectures, CI/CD, kubernetes, or whatever.

It features an in-depth analysis of sentiments expressed in these posts, comments, and by the authors themselves, all tracked and evaluated over the same seven-day period.\n\n## Features\n\nThe project is entirely hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and is ***horizontal scalable***. The scraping workload is evenly distributed across the computer engines(VM). Data manipulation is done through the Spark cluster(Google dataproc), where by increasing the worker node, the workload will be distributed across and finished more quickly.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t4tagdp2zdc1.jpg?width=1651&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12f4e0f6dd1456191d349ed10d2200ca80c5df86\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/97414aef-54dc-4fc8-8bf5-054f0ac75d2c) is generated with following parameters: 1 VM for airflow, 2 VMs for scraping, 1 VM with Nvidia-T4 GPU, Spark cluster(2 worker node 1 manager node), 10 universities in California.\n\n## Example Dashboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd9ykrnq2zdc1.png?width=2886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d11ccac6550a059fd1f4c10b1433ae327792096\n\n## Example DAG\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qcyo7njr2zdc1.png?width=2932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2e6d7fbbaebbc5a69ffb0725a86704486bd708e\n\n## Tools\n\n1.

I'm trying to set up a new infrastructure for data in my organization. I'm not a data engineer, but I'm trying to understand the problem and look for the best solutions. I wanted to ask you for some advice:\n\nI need to extract data from a source (using Airbyte), place this data in a warehouse (using Clickhouse), transform this data to generate better visualizations (dbt) and eventually visualize this data (Metabase).\n\nI wanted to know if this makes sense. My focus is open source tools, which I can deploy locally and manage, hence the tools mentioned.\n\nAfter that, I would also like to be able to perform some actions on this data. For example, using Retool or some tool that allows me to perform actions to insert data into my data. So I don't know exactly how to proceed.\n\nI can connect Retool directly to my warehouse and perform actions with the data there, inserting new rows that represent other information linked to some table (for example, a users table), but I understand that this would not be the best way to proceed.\n\nI know that there are \"Reverse ETLs\", which took the data from the warehouse and placed it elsewhere, for example in Retool itself. But, how (preferably using some tool) can I insert new lines of information into my data using this architecture?\n\nI thought that Reverse ETL could connect to Postgres, replicate the data that I think is relevant from the warehouse, then Retool connects to that Postgres and eventually performs data insertions in that database, then Airbyte ingests the data again, doing rewrite of the old data. That makes sense?\n\nAny information, advice or help would be great!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qhmeb6g1wzdc1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b497632952d22c447aa79da1dc842c4a967d338f", "author_fullname": "t2_6cona65", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Advice on data infrastructure", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 99, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qhmeb6g1wzdc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 76, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhmeb6g1wzdc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44398c6f12f101b319cde42a9021ea370df6ecf5"}, {"y": 153, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhmeb6g1wzdc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59a000e5e7a2b19a6ae464bcfdebc215de0860e6"}, {"y": 227, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhmeb6g1wzdc1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6cce5873e5a98f8d542964fa1b3c444ad81443b"}, {"y": 454, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhmeb6g1wzdc1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24cbc1cfec45365c0cad62ab7b700987db367e75"}], "s": {"y": 666, "x": 938, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qhmeb6g1wzdc1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b497632952d22c447aa79da1dc842c4a967d338f"}, "id": "qhmeb6g1wzdc1"}}, "name": "t3_19cvtuu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Help", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/iulZ2kXZGBc7hVz0WxRXgmHvSHrzpVjB882vsil5n6Q.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1705930744.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!
