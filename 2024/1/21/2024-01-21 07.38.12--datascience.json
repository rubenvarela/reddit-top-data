Never thought that \u201cwork stress\u201d would get me as much as it does when I was a kid, but I guess we\u2019re all naive when we\u2019re young. \n\nAnyway, I joined my current firm 7 months ago after having completed 2 internships there and several bad experiences with rude and obnoxious peers. This made me feel like I was the dumbest person working there and that I didn\u2019t belong, so I guess in an effort to make up for that misconception, I over compensated.\n\n4 months ago I got involved on this project with a multi national client with an arbitrarily stupid timeline. The project essentially was building a CRUD application from scratch to replicate the interactions of a highly complex (and eventually incorrect) excel model. The project was being led by a manager who I liked on a professional level. He was tasked with building a team for this project and I was his first choice. His hands were tied because we\u2019re a consulting firm (with a dedicated DS team) and finding people with the skillset to build and deploy a web application is close to impossible. There\u2019s like 3 of us who know full stack development. 2/3 were already working on other projects and couldn\u2019t get involved. \n\nAnyway, 6 of us were split into a front end and backend team for this project, being built using a Vue + ASP.NET + Python stack. I was leading the front end team. I was leading the front end team of 3 (one of them was just doing basic CSS like changing colors and making buttons bigger, the other had a lot of C# experience and was very useful for front end dev but had zero python knowledge) \n\nAs the project proceeded, we realized just how dumb the timeline was. Given the data scoping and wireframing phases, we essentially had a month to build the whole app up from scratch. This month being December so naturally people were on holiday for a substantial chunk of time. \n\nLong story short, I got stuck not only working on the front end , but also making adjustments on the backend, being responsible for deploying the application on the client machine etc. \n\nThe backend folk did a terrible job initially and also couldn\u2019t split any front end work as they did not have that skillset. The other two front end people refused to do any python. The deployment was initially set up by a senior in a very ad hoc manner and I was the only one who bothered to shadow him. Of course he went on vacation before the final deployment and that too fell on my shoulders. \n\nWe\u2019re demoing Monday morning. I had plans to take Friday evening off but I couldn\u2019t because we had to deploy before the weekend. My manager tested and caught some bugs and sent an email saying we will have to redeploy. I honestly want to cry I\u2019ve been so overworked I hate it. I wanted to spend my Sunday just watching football and relaxing. I don\u2019t understand how to get out of this situation besides just toughing it out and working.
