Each of the two backup PC&amp;#39;s have 10 HDD&amp;#39;s arranged as 5 mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest problem is running out of SATA ports, so I&amp;#39;m using 4-port SATA PCIe adapters (Marvel chipset) on my 2 backup PC&amp;#39;s, even though they don&amp;#39;t come highly recommeded.  My main PC will not recognise any of the 4-port SATA PCIe adapters (Asus ROG STRIX B450-F Gaming II mobo). It was for this mobo I bought the Intel RES2SV240 as a possible solution without realising it had to connect to a SAS PCIe HBA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is, can I buy a non-RAID SAS PCIe HBA (or a RAID HBA card not configure for RAID use) to connect to the Intel card in a non-RAID mode; if so, what SAS PCIe HBA would you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All suggestions will be gratefully appreciated&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7eead6f2-b94e-11eb-af94-0e4c7cd4fb01", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "19dv606", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dominator9947", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/19dv606/using_intel_res2sv240_with_a_nonraid_sas_hba_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/19dv606/using_intel_res2sv240_with_a_nonraid_sas_hba_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 727535, "created_utc": 1706034475.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "need help or at least some discussions", "author_fullname": "t2_165pw92f", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Had anyone done scraping on iPad apps before?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_19du25v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1706031832.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;need help or at least some discussions&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "19du25v", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anonymous_2600", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/19du25v/had_anyone_done_scraping_on_ipad_apps_before/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/19du25v/had_anyone_done_scraping_on_ipad_apps_before/", "subreddit_subscribers": 727535, "created_utc": 1706031832.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I have an old 8tb seagate drive that was encoded with NTFS when I first bought it.
