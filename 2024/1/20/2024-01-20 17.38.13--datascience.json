The job title was in healthcare, reimbursement analytics, working with insurance and finance to process insurance claims. Mostly customer service, administration and data entry. And while we do use tools like Excel, it&amp;#39;s minimal. Practically nothing I learned in my bootcamp (Tableau, PowerBI, PPT, Python, SQL) is utilized here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only upside I can see to this role is it looks like am an analyst in finance, there&amp;#39;s remote work most of the time (hybrid) and opportunity to go fully remote, as well as possible advancement within the company, and it might be a good resume booster when I decide to find a higher paying role. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, I am having doubts about this position, what is your thoughts in my case, should I stick it through only a year then apply to other companies, or should I try to stay longer and seek advancement opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b026063c-d780-11e7-aba9-0e030591a4b4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "id": "19asgdi", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "the-alchemist-", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/19asgdi/started_new_position_in_healthcare_reimbursement/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/19asgdi/started_new_position_in_healthcare_reimbursement/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1261090, "created_utc": 1705695068.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "So I\u2019m working on this machine learning project to find improper payments.
