Unfortunately in attempting to clarify this subject I did the exact opposite. Hence my attempt to start a new thread from scratch (too much datahoarding last week; I think my brain was fried).\n\nAlthough these differences might seem trivial, to those who have placed their data and trust in optical media for archival purposes (and thus expect reasonable longevity from the media) this stuff is actually data-critical. Hence I'm investing some time and effort in trying to get to the bottom of things.\n\n# LTH vs HTL\n\nLet's start with what's uncontroversial:\n\n**LTH = low to high = recording layer is organic** (like CDs and DVDs). BD-R LTH was attractive to the storage industry and they could only slightly modify existing CD and DVD production lines to churn out this media.\n\n**HTL = high to low = recording layer is inorganic** (like M-Discs). In Verbatim world, HTL involves the use of MABL (metal ablative recording layer). But MABL is not the only possible implementation of an inorganic recording layer for BD-X media.\n\nHere's how Verbatim describe **MABL** (I'm quoting verbatim - pardon the pun - from their marketing literature):\n\n*\"MABL: A specially created inorganic recording layer present on Verbatim's BD-R media ensures excellent recording compatibility and prolonged stability for archival life.\"*\n\nOrganic dyes - including AZO - are subject to ageing and deterioration. Dye degradation leads to lack of optical contrast which leads to lost data. It's widely believed that inorganic recording layers offer superior longevity (for MABL, I've heard 300 years thrown about. Mdisc famously claims a millennium.)\n\nThis doesn't mean that inorganic recording layers are guaranteed to be impervious to data loss. M-Discs's product literature suggests that the polycarbonate substrate may be a more vulnerable failing point than the recording layer itself. Presumably inorganic layers can degrade in other ways that would reduce the all-important optical contrast which holds the key to data preservation on optical media. But it seems overall like inorganic layers including metal alloys are better primed for the job of staying physically inert over time than their organic counterparts.\n\n# HTL / Inorganic Blu Rays vs. M-Discs\n\nAnd here's what I can surmise on this particularly controversial topic:\n\n***To the extent that the M-Disc and HTL Blu Rays are different, the differences probably have to do with differences in the composition of the inorganic layer***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nEven researching this subject briefly, you can find resources pointing to different alloys and composites that different manufacturers have used in their Blu-Ray products intended for archival.\n\nWhat's marketing speak? What's legit? The only truthful answer as far as I can tell is \"nobody knows.\" The M-Disc BD-R came to market in 2014, 10 years ago. At the time I'm writing this, we'd need to hop into a time machine and teleport 990 years into the future to test whether that claimed longevity was accurate.\n\nIs whatever's in the M-Disc truly better than whatever's in Verbatim's \"regular\" BD-R with MABL?\n\nI suggest that it's reasonable to assume that there's at least some difference. For a very simple reason. It wouldn't make sense for Verbatim to maintain the Verbatim M-Disc and regular Verbatim (HTL) BD-Rs as concurrent product lines if there were truly no differences. Of course, Verbatim could be duping us. But I would suggest that unless somebody can prove that to be the case by examining the products' material composition at the microscopic level that ... this level of skepticism and cynicism may be unwarranted.\n\nAnd what about the archival BD-Rs that Sony, JVC, Panasonic, and others have brought to market? Aren't these also engineered with inorganic recording layers? Yes they are!\n\nI suggest that all any of us can do is evaluate the technology on the basis of the best information available to us. Even if we were privy to the exact formulations of nanomaterials used in rival products, I'd suggest that this information wouldn't take us much further to the truth in trying to discern which product is the very best (because we'd still have to rely on the extrapolated calculations of accelerated ageing tests to determine truths).\n\nMight the most simple and reasonable advice be *\"pick a brand you like and trust and hope their claims live up to what's on the website?\"* It may actually be all any of us can do.\n\n# HTL vs. LTH Debate On Reddit\n\nThere have been [much discussed threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/8ihutc/100_of_bdr_bluray_disks_are_now_organic_lth/) on this sub alleging that all Blu Rays in circulation are low to high (LTH), organic media. So last week, I decided to reach out to Verbatim to ask whether their currently produced BD-R media is LTH or HTL.\n\n**Verbatim responded that they no longer make** ***LTH*** **Blu Ray media. Ie, all their Blu Ray media in production is** ***HTL.***\n\nIn retrospect, this seems to make abundant sense (and yes, assuming this is true, this means that the poster in the above thread is incorrect).\n\nMy current \"regular Joe\" Verbatim BD-Rs detect as HTL. But more importantly it seems as if the manufacturers collectively did something of a rethink about the sagacity of trying to use organic dyes in Blu Rays.\n\n***The chronology as I understand it goes something like this:***\n\n\\-&gt; Blu-Ray was originally standardised on HTL\n\n\\-&gt; In 2009-2010 Verbatim launch BD-R LTH using AZO as the recording dye. This BD-R was often marketed as \"Blu Ray LTH Type\" to differentiate it from HTL which was the original and thus \"standard\" BD-R. BD-R LTH proved finnicky with burner firmware and perhaps anoraks like us didn't like the regression that a move from inorganic to organic recording layers entailed.\n\n\\-&gt; In 20XX (I don't know the date) Verbatim seems to have quietly shelved the LTH idea and went back to making BD-R HTL media.\n\n\\-&gt; In April 2014 Milleniata launches the first Blu Ray version of the M-Disc (25GB).\n\n\\-&gt; In December 2016 Milleniata files for bankruptcy.\n\n\\-&gt; 2016 - present: Milleniata licenses its technology to Verbatim and Ritek. Verbatim produces the M-Disc as BD-R, BD-DL, and BDXL (100GB). Ritek initially makes M-Disc DVDs and BD-Rs before focusing exclusively on Blu Rays. Verbatim never manufactured M-Disc DVDs.\n\nThe trajectory of consumer-writable Blu Ray's is thus HTL -&gt; LTH -&gt; HTL. And at some point after we got back onto HTL the M-Disc came to market and was then subsumed into Verbatim's product lines.\n\nVerbatim (now a subsidiary of CMC) is of course only one of several disc manufacturers. You can still find BR-LTH discs on the market without too much trouble. Although I'm not sure why anybody would specifically want them.\n\n# My Closing Hot Take\n\n**Realistically, stability of digital data beyond 100 years is likely not necessary.** Thus whether technology A vs B can guarantee archival life of 100 or 1,000 years is a moot point. \n\nSince the advent of the digital age storage technology has rapidly evolved. It's reasonable to assume that the storage industry will have come up with a better solution for data permanence than Blu Rays in .... perhaps 30 years. \n\nWe hope and expect, of course, that this point will occur before the deprecation of optical media .. and that backward compatibility will enable us to get our stuff out of the old archival medium (Blu Ray) and onto its better successor ... hopefully with vastly greater data densities. \n\nI've heard it said frequently that LTO gets unreliable after about 30 years (max). For cold data preservation longer than that, optical media is (weirdly) basically what's out there. \n\nWhether you're putting your trust in archival grade CDs, DVDs, Verbatim BD-R or the M-Disc ... we'll do well to get 50 years of stable storage out of these things. \n\n*\\*All the above is correctly only to the best of my knowledge at the time of posting. This stuff certainly gets confusing. The definitive source of information about all this is probably the Blu Ray Alliance (BDA).

Unfortunately in attempting to clarify this subject I did the exact opposite. Hence my attempt to start a new thread from scratch (too much datahoarding last week; I think my brain was fried).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although these differences might seem trivial, to those who have placed their data and trust in optical media for archival purposes (and thus expect reasonable longevity from the media) this stuff is actually data-critical. Hence I&amp;#39;m investing some time and effort in trying to get to the bottom of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;LTH vs HTL&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with what&amp;#39;s uncontroversial:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LTH = low to high = recording layer is organic&lt;/strong&gt; (like CDs and DVDs). BD-R LTH was attractive to the storage industry and they could only slightly modify existing CD and DVD production lines to churn out this media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTL = high to low = recording layer is inorganic&lt;/strong&gt; (like M-Discs). In Verbatim world, HTL involves the use of MABL (metal ablative recording layer). But MABL is not the only possible implementation of an inorganic recording layer for BD-X media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how Verbatim describe &lt;strong&gt;MABL&lt;/strong&gt; (I&amp;#39;m quoting verbatim - pardon the pun - from their marketing literature):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;MABL: A specially created inorganic recording layer present on Verbatim&amp;#39;s BD-R media ensures excellent recording compatibility and prolonged stability for archival life.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Organic dyes - including AZO - are subject to ageing and deterioration. Dye degradation leads to lack of optical contrast which leads to lost data. It&amp;#39;s widely believed that inorganic recording layers offer superior longevity (for MABL, I&amp;#39;ve heard 300 years thrown about. Mdisc famously claims a millennium.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that inorganic recording layers are guaranteed to be impervious to data loss. M-Discs&amp;#39;s product literature suggests that the polycarbonate substrate may be a more vulnerable failing point than the recording layer itself. Presumably inorganic layers can degrade in other ways that would reduce the all-important optical contrast which holds the key to data preservation on optical media. But it seems overall like inorganic layers including metal alloys are better primed for the job of staying physically inert over time than their organic counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;HTL / Inorganic Blu Rays vs. M-Discs&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s what I can surmise on this particularly controversial topic:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the extent that the M-Disc and HTL Blu Rays are different, the differences probably have to do with differences in the composition of the inorganic layer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**.**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even researching this subject briefly, you can find resources pointing to different alloys and composites that different manufacturers have used in their Blu-Ray products intended for archival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s marketing speak? What&amp;#39;s legit? The only truthful answer as far as I can tell is &amp;quot;nobody knows.&amp;quot; The M-Disc BD-R came to market in 2014, 10 years ago. At the time I&amp;#39;m writing this, we&amp;#39;d need to hop into a time machine and teleport 990 years into the future to test whether that claimed longevity was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is whatever&amp;#39;s in the M-Disc truly better than whatever&amp;#39;s in Verbatim&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; BD-R with MABL?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest that it&amp;#39;s reasonable to assume that there&amp;#39;s at least some difference. For a very simple reason. It wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense for Verbatim to maintain the Verbatim M-Disc and regular Verbatim (HTL) BD-Rs as concurrent product lines if there were truly no differences. Of course, Verbatim could be duping us. But I would suggest that unless somebody can prove that to be the case by examining the products&amp;#39; material composition at the microscopic level that ... this level of skepticism and cynicism may be unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what about the archival BD-Rs that Sony, JVC, Panasonic, and others have brought to market? Aren&amp;#39;t these also engineered with inorganic recording layers? Yes they are!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest that all any of us can do is evaluate the technology on the basis of the best information available to us. Even if we were privy to the exact formulations of nanomaterials used in rival products, I&amp;#39;d suggest that this information wouldn&amp;#39;t take us much further to the truth in trying to discern which product is the very best (because we&amp;#39;d still have to rely on the extrapolated calculations of accelerated ageing tests to determine truths).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might the most simple and reasonable advice be &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;pick a brand you like and trust and hope their claims live up to what&amp;#39;s on the website?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; It may actually be all any of us can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;HTL vs. LTH Debate On Reddit&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/8ihutc/100_of_bdr_bluray_disks_are_now_organic_lth/\"&gt;much discussed threads&lt;/a&gt; on this sub alleging that all Blu Rays in circulation are low to high (LTH), organic media. So last week, I decided to reach out to Verbatim to ask whether their currently produced BD-R media is LTH or HTL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbatim responded that they no longer make&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Blu Ray media. Ie, all their Blu Ray media in production is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HTL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this seems to make abundant sense (and yes, assuming this is true, this means that the poster in the above thread is incorrect).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current &amp;quot;regular Joe&amp;quot; Verbatim BD-Rs detect as HTL. But more importantly it seems as if the manufacturers collectively did something of a rethink about the sagacity of trying to use organic dyes in Blu Rays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chronology as I understand it goes something like this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; Blu-Ray was originally standardised on HTL&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; In 2009-2010 Verbatim launch BD-R LTH using AZO as the recording dye.

It will back up my Windows 11 PC (approximately 8.5TB) and my wife's 2015 iMac (around 3TB, running macOS 11.x). The setup won't need to serve any other functions like hosting media, web servers, or containers.\n\nCurrently, we rely on a Synology DS916+ NAS as our primary backup solution, complemented by off-site cloud backup via CrashPlan (though we'll need an alternative soon, either a new Mac or a new service, due to MacOS version limitations with CrashPlan's software).\n\nI'm seeking a solution that maximizes the available drive space while keeping the SSD for the OS. Initially, I considered JBOD to combine the 4x3TB and 1x5TB drives. While I'm not *overly* concerned about fault tolerance due to our other backups, the idea of replacing a faulty disk and repopulating the entire array isn't appealing. I'm unaware of any JBOD-like solutions that offer fault tolerance, if such a thing exists.\n\nAnother option is converting the RAID10 array to RAID5, providing approximately 8TB of usable space. However, this would require the Windows backup to span both the RAID5 array and the 5TB drive, complicating the setup. JBOD would offer around 15-16TB (formatted) by comparison.\n\nThe solution has to be compatible with both macOS 11.x and Windows 11 sources, and require minimal ongoing maintenance\u2014a \"fire-and-forget\" setup. It should automatically compare source files with backups, make necessary updates, and run scheduled backups nightly, providing alerts in case of issues. Ideally it would be GUI based, rather than CLI (just for my own sanity).\n\nWhile I know of the existence of solutions like FreeNAS/TrueNAS, OpenMediaVault and Unraid, I'm unsure which, if any of them, would best suit my needs. I'm not opposed to spending some $ on software, but I'd like to avoid spending $$ replacing the HDDs, as the whole purpose is to keep this as cheap as possible and learn something new along the way.\n\nAny advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

No e-mail contact is possible in either address (&lt;a href=\"mailto:asp@jacob.de\"&gt;asp@jacob.de&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mailto:info@jacob.de\"&gt;info@jacob.de&lt;/a&gt;), despite having sent me emails from both addresses before I sent them back the HDD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from contacting the European Consumer office to legally address the case, is there anything I could try to do or contact to get some outcome from an e-shop that ghosts all my emails? I find 100 days for replacing/reimbursing a HDD long enough, ghosting apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1adek1i", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jfromeo", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adek1i/european_eshop_ghosting_me_for_100_days_after/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adek1i/european_eshop_ghosting_me_for_100_days_after/", "subreddit_subscribers": 728752, "created_utc": 1706479561.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Does anyone have any recommendations for a dual thunderbolt enclosure that gets 40Gbps transfer rates and fits M.2 NVME sticks?", "author_fullname": "t2_mqc0c351m", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dual Thunderbolt Enclosure?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1ad6xqv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1706460558.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any recommendations for a dual thunderbolt enclosure that gets 40Gbps transfer rates and fits M.2 NVME sticks?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1ad6xqv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bandeauhelpers0g", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ad6xqv/dual_thunderbolt_enclosure/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ad6xqv/dual_thunderbolt_enclosure/", "subreddit_subscribers": 728752, "created_utc": 1706460558.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hi!

I am expecting their needs to increase a bit, so if 5TB models are compelling (pricewise) compared to the 4TB ones, i wil spring for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was mostly looking at external HDD&amp;#39;s, with a usb-c connector (which is the connector they are slowly migrating towards) and a separate power connector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this sub i see a lot of recommendations for an internal HDD with a separate external enclosure. That would work (i would just put the hdd in the enclosure for them), but i don&amp;#39;t really know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any recommendation for either:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A good enclosure (and what to look for) +  internal drive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a good external HDD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any tips on this use case are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7eead6f2-b94e-11eb-af94-0e4c7cd4fb01", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1adayhx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shybearsecurity", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adayhx/looking_for_an_external_backup_drive_for_my/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adayhx/looking_for_an_external_backup_drive_for_my/", "subreddit_subscribers": 728752, "created_utc": 1706470563.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hey all, I'm looking for an enclosure similar to a My Book Duo.
