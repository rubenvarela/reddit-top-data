I know this is not 100% true, but I am starting to worry. To what extent is this claim accurate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From where I live, there seems to be a lot more MLE jobs available than DS. Of the few DS jobs, some of the JD asks for a lot more engineering skills like spark, cloud computing and deployment than they asked stats. The remaining DS jobs just seem like a rebrand of a data analyst. A friend of mine who work in a software company that it\u2019s becoming a norm to have a full team of MLE and no DS. Is it true?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a background in social science so I have dealt with data analytics and statistics for a fair amount.
