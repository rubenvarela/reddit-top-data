Unfortunately in attempting to clarify this subject I did the exact opposite. Hence my attempt to start a new thread from scratch (too much datahoarding last week; I think my brain was fried).\n\nAlthough these differences might seem trivial, to those who have placed their data and trust in optical media for archival purposes (and thus expect reasonable longevity from the media) this stuff is actually data-critical. Hence I'm investing some time and effort in trying to get to the bottom of things.\n\n# LTH vs HTL\n\nLet's start with what's uncontroversial:\n\n**LTH = low to high = recording layer is organic** (like CDs and DVDs). BD-R LTH was attractive to the storage industry and they could only slightly modify existing CD and DVD production lines to churn out this media.\n\n**HTL = high to low = recording layer is inorganic** (like M-Discs). In Verbatim world, HTL involves the use of MABL (metal ablative recording layer). But MABL is not the only possible implementation of an inorganic recording layer for BD-X media.\n\nHere's how Verbatim describe **MABL** (I'm quoting verbatim - pardon the pun - from their marketing literature):\n\n*\"MABL: A specially created inorganic recording layer present on Verbatim's BD-R media ensures excellent recording compatibility and prolonged stability for archival life.\"*\n\nOrganic dyes - including AZO - are subject to ageing and deterioration. Dye degradation leads to lack of optical contrast which leads to lost data. It's widely believed that inorganic recording layers offer superior longevity (for MABL, I've heard 300 years thrown about. Mdisc famously claims a millennium.)\n\nThis doesn't mean that inorganic recording layers are guaranteed to be impervious to data loss. M-Discs's product literature suggests that the polycarbonate substrate may be a more vulnerable failing point than the recording layer itself. Presumably inorganic layers can degrade in other ways that would reduce the all-important optical contrast which holds the key to data preservation on optical media. But it seems overall like inorganic layers including metal alloys are better primed for the job of staying physically inert over time than their organic counterparts.\n\n# HTL / Inorganic Blu Rays vs. M-Discs\n\nAnd here's what I can surmise on this particularly controversial topic:\n\n***To the extent that the M-Disc and HTL Blu Rays are different, the differences probably have to do with differences in the composition of the inorganic layer***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nEven researching this subject briefly, you can find resources pointing to different alloys and composites that different manufacturers have used in their Blu-Ray products intended for archival.\n\nWhat's marketing speak? What's legit? The only truthful answer as far as I can tell is \"nobody knows.\" The M-Disc BD-R came to market in 2014, 10 years ago. At the time I'm writing this, we'd need to hop into a time machine and teleport 990 years into the future to test whether that claimed longevity was accurate.\n\nIs whatever's in the M-Disc truly better than whatever's in Verbatim's \"regular\" BD-R with MABL?\n\nI suggest that it's reasonable to assume that there's at least some difference. For a very simple reason. It wouldn't make sense for Verbatim to maintain the Verbatim M-Disc and regular Verbatim (HTL) BD-Rs as concurrent product lines if there were truly no differences. Of course, Verbatim could be duping us. But I would suggest that unless somebody can prove that to be the case by examining the products' material composition at the microscopic level that ... this level of skepticism and cynicism may be unwarranted.\n\nAnd what about the archival BD-Rs that Sony, JVC, Panasonic, and others have brought to market? Aren't these also engineered with inorganic recording layers? Yes they are!\n\nI suggest that all any of us can do is evaluate the technology on the basis of the best information available to us. Even if we were privy to the exact formulations of nanomaterials used in rival products, I'd suggest that this information wouldn't take us much further to the truth in trying to discern which product is the very best (because we'd still have to rely on the extrapolated calculations of accelerated ageing tests to determine truths).\n\nMight the most simple and reasonable advice be *\"pick a brand you like and trust and hope their claims live up to what's on the website?\"* It may actually be all any of us can do.\n\n# HTL vs. LTH Debate On Reddit\n\nThere have been [much discussed threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/8ihutc/100_of_bdr_bluray_disks_are_now_organic_lth/) on this sub alleging that all Blu Rays in circulation are low to high (LTH), organic media. So last week, I decided to reach out to Verbatim to ask whether their currently produced BD-R media is LTH or HTL.\n\n**Verbatim responded that they no longer make** ***LTH*** **Blu Ray media. Ie, all their Blu Ray media in production is** ***HTL.***\n\nIn retrospect, this seems to make abundant sense (and yes, assuming this is true, this means that the poster in the above thread is incorrect).\n\nMy current \"regular Joe\" Verbatim BD-Rs detect as HTL. But more importantly it seems as if the manufacturers collectively did something of a rethink about the sagacity of trying to use organic dyes in Blu Rays.\n\n***The chronology as I understand it goes something like this:***\n\n\\-&gt; Blu-Ray was originally standardised on HTL\n\n\\-&gt; In 2009-2010 Verbatim launch BD-R LTH using AZO as the recording dye. This BD-R was often marketed as \"Blu Ray LTH Type\" to differentiate it from HTL which was the original and thus \"standard\" BD-R. BD-R LTH proved finnicky with burner firmware and perhaps anoraks like us didn't like the regression that a move from inorganic to organic recording layers entailed.\n\n\\-&gt; In 20XX (I don't know the date) Verbatim seems to have quietly shelved the LTH idea and went back to making BD-R HTL media.\n\n\\-&gt; In April 2014 Milleniata launches the first Blu Ray version of the M-Disc (25GB).\n\n\\-&gt; In December 2016 Milleniata files for bankruptcy.\n\n\\-&gt; 2016 - present: Milleniata licenses its technology to Verbatim and Ritek. Verbatim produces the M-Disc as BD-R, BD-DL, and BDXL (100GB). Ritek initially makes M-Disc DVDs and BD-Rs before focusing exclusively on Blu Rays. Verbatim never manufactured M-Disc DVDs.\n\nThe trajectory of consumer-writable Blu Ray's is thus HTL -&gt; LTH -&gt; HTL. And at some point after we got back onto HTL the M-Disc came to market and was then subsumed into Verbatim's product lines.\n\nVerbatim (now a subsidiary of CMC) is of course only one of several disc manufacturers. You can still find BR-LTH discs on the market without too much trouble. Although I'm not sure why anybody would specifically want them.\n\n# My Closing Hot Take\n\n**Realistically, stability of digital data beyond 100 years is likely not necessary.** Thus whether technology A vs B can guarantee archival life of 100 or 1,000 years is a moot point. \n\nSince the advent of the digital age storage technology has rapidly evolved. It's reasonable to assume that the storage industry will have come up with a better solution for data permanence than Blu Rays in .... perhaps 30 years. \n\nWe hope and expect, of course, that this point will occur before the deprecation of optical media .. and that backward compatibility will enable us to get our stuff out of the old archival medium (Blu Ray) and onto its better successor ... hopefully with vastly greater data densities. \n\nI've heard it said frequently that LTO gets unreliable after about 30 years (max).

Unfortunately in attempting to clarify this subject I did the exact opposite. Hence my attempt to start a new thread from scratch (too much datahoarding last week; I think my brain was fried).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although these differences might seem trivial, to those who have placed their data and trust in optical media for archival purposes (and thus expect reasonable longevity from the media) this stuff is actually data-critical. Hence I&amp;#39;m investing some time and effort in trying to get to the bottom of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;LTH vs HTL&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with what&amp;#39;s uncontroversial:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LTH = low to high = recording layer is organic&lt;/strong&gt; (like CDs and DVDs). BD-R LTH was attractive to the storage industry and they could only slightly modify existing CD and DVD production lines to churn out this media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTL = high to low = recording layer is inorganic&lt;/strong&gt; (like M-Discs). In Verbatim world, HTL involves the use of MABL (metal ablative recording layer). But MABL is not the only possible implementation of an inorganic recording layer for BD-X media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how Verbatim describe &lt;strong&gt;MABL&lt;/strong&gt; (I&amp;#39;m quoting verbatim - pardon the pun - from their marketing literature):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;MABL: A specially created inorganic recording layer present on Verbatim&amp;#39;s BD-R media ensures excellent recording compatibility and prolonged stability for archival life.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Organic dyes - including AZO - are subject to ageing and deterioration. Dye degradation leads to lack of optical contrast which leads to lost data. It&amp;#39;s widely believed that inorganic recording layers offer superior longevity (for MABL, I&amp;#39;ve heard 300 years thrown about. Mdisc famously claims a millennium.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that inorganic recording layers are guaranteed to be impervious to data loss. M-Discs&amp;#39;s product literature suggests that the polycarbonate substrate may be a more vulnerable failing point than the recording layer itself. Presumably inorganic layers can degrade in other ways that would reduce the all-important optical contrast which holds the key to data preservation on optical media. But it seems overall like inorganic layers including metal alloys are better primed for the job of staying physically inert over time than their organic counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;HTL / Inorganic Blu Rays vs. M-Discs&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s what I can surmise on this particularly controversial topic:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the extent that the M-Disc and HTL Blu Rays are different, the differences probably have to do with differences in the composition of the inorganic layer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**.**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even researching this subject briefly, you can find resources pointing to different alloys and composites that different manufacturers have used in their Blu-Ray products intended for archival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s marketing speak? What&amp;#39;s legit? The only truthful answer as far as I can tell is &amp;quot;nobody knows.&amp;quot; The M-Disc BD-R came to market in 2014, 10 years ago. At the time I&amp;#39;m writing this, we&amp;#39;d need to hop into a time machine and teleport 990 years into the future to test whether that claimed longevity was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is whatever&amp;#39;s in the M-Disc truly better than whatever&amp;#39;s in Verbatim&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; BD-R with MABL?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest that it&amp;#39;s reasonable to assume that there&amp;#39;s at least some difference. For a very simple reason. It wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense for Verbatim to maintain the Verbatim M-Disc and regular Verbatim (HTL) BD-Rs as concurrent product lines if there were truly no differences. Of course, Verbatim could be duping us. But I would suggest that unless somebody can prove that to be the case by examining the products&amp;#39; material composition at the microscopic level that ... this level of skepticism and cynicism may be unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what about the archival BD-Rs that Sony, JVC, Panasonic, and others have brought to market? Aren&amp;#39;t these also engineered with inorganic recording layers? Yes they are!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest that all any of us can do is evaluate the technology on the basis of the best information available to us. Even if we were privy to the exact formulations of nanomaterials used in rival products, I&amp;#39;d suggest that this information wouldn&amp;#39;t take us much further to the truth in trying to discern which product is the very best (because we&amp;#39;d still have to rely on the extrapolated calculations of accelerated ageing tests to determine truths).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might the most simple and reasonable advice be &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;pick a brand you like and trust and hope their claims live up to what&amp;#39;s on the website?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; It may actually be all any of us can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;HTL vs. LTH Debate On Reddit&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/8ihutc/100_of_bdr_bluray_disks_are_now_organic_lth/\"&gt;much discussed threads&lt;/a&gt; on this sub alleging that all Blu Rays in circulation are low to high (LTH), organic media. So last week, I decided to reach out to Verbatim to ask whether their currently produced BD-R media is LTH or HTL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbatim responded that they no longer make&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Blu Ray media. Ie, all their Blu Ray media in production is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HTL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this seems to make abundant sense (and yes, assuming this is true, this means that the poster in the above thread is incorrect).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current &amp;quot;regular Joe&amp;quot; Verbatim BD-Rs detect as HTL. But more importantly it seems as if the manufacturers collectively did something of a rethink about the sagacity of trying to use organic dyes in Blu Rays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chronology as I understand it goes something like this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; Blu-Ray was originally standardised on HTL&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; In 2009-2010 Verbatim launch BD-R LTH using AZO as the recording dye. This BD-R was often marketed as &amp;quot;Blu Ray LTH Type&amp;quot; to differentiate it from HTL which was the original and thus &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; BD-R. BD-R LTH proved finnicky with burner firmware and perhaps anoraks like us didn&amp;#39;t like the regression that a move from inorganic to organic recording layers entailed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; In 20XX (I don&amp;#39;t know the date) Verbatim seems to have quietly shelved the LTH idea and went back to making BD-R HTL media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; In April 2014 Milleniata launches the first Blu Ray version of the M-Disc (25GB).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; In December 2016 Milleniata files for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; 2016 - present: Milleniata licenses its technology to Verbatim and Ritek. Verbatim produces the M-Disc as BD-R, BD-DL, and BDXL (100GB). Ritek initially makes M-Disc DVDs and BD-Rs before focusing exclusively on Blu Rays. Verbatim never manufactured M-Disc DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trajectory of consumer-writable Blu Ray&amp;#39;s is thus HTL -&amp;gt; LTH -&amp;gt; HTL. And at some point after we got back onto HTL the M-Disc came to market and was then subsumed into Verbatim&amp;#39;s product lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Verbatim (now a subsidiary of CMC) is of course only one of several disc manufacturers. You can still find BR-LTH discs on the market without too much trouble. Although I&amp;#39;m not sure why anybody would specifically want them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My Closing Hot Take&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realistically, stability of digital data beyond 100 years is likely not necessary.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus whether technology A vs B can guarantee archival life of 100 or 1,000 years is a moot point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the advent of the digital age storage technology has rapidly evolved. It&amp;#39;s reasonable to assume that the storage industry will have come up with a better solution for data permanence than Blu Rays in .... perhaps 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hope and expect, of course, that this point will occur before the deprecation of optical media .. and that backward compatibility will enable us to get our stuff out of the old archival medium (Blu Ray) and onto its better successor ... hopefully with vastly greater data densities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard it said frequently that LTO gets unreliable after about 30 years (max). For cold data preservation longer than that, optical media is (weirdly) basically what&amp;#39;s out there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#39;re putting your trust in archival grade CDs, DVDs, Verbatim BD-R or the M-Disc ... we&amp;#39;ll do well to get 50 years of stable storage out of these things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;All the above is correctly only to the best of my knowledge at the time of posting. This stuff certainly gets confusing. The definitive source of information about all this is probably the Blu Ray Alliance (BDA).

However, this would require the Windows backup to span both the RAID5 array and the 5TB drive, complicating the setup. JBOD would offer around 15-16TB (formatted) by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution has to be compatible with both macOS 11.x and Windows 11 sources, and require minimal ongoing maintenance\u2014a &amp;quot;fire-and-forget&amp;quot; setup. It should automatically compare source files with backups, make necessary updates, and run scheduled backups nightly, providing alerts in case of issues. Ideally it would be GUI based, rather than CLI (just for my own sanity).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I know of the existence of solutions like FreeNAS/TrueNAS, OpenMediaVault and Unraid, I&amp;#39;m unsure which, if any of them, would best suit my needs. I&amp;#39;m not opposed to spending some $ on software, but I&amp;#39;d like to avoid spending $$ replacing the HDDs, as the whole purpose is to keep this as cheap as possible and learn something new along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7eead6f2-b94e-11eb-af94-0e4c7cd4fb01", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1ad9wnh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thebundok", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ad9wnh/using_retired_pc_for_cold_storage_backup_solution/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ad9wnh/using_retired_pc_for_cold_storage_backup_solution/", "subreddit_subscribers": 728781, "created_utc": 1706467992.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hello community,\n\nThank you for your time \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nHave just replaced the 4TB Ironwolf NAS HDDs in my RAID 5 Thunderbolt 2 enclosure with 4TB WD Red SSDs.

I currently have 2 NAS: the main one that I use for my day to day storage and a second one that is off most of the time that I only turn on the backup the main NAS on. I addition to that, I also backup my most important files to an S3 compatible provider (wasabi not to name it), so I have an off site backup on a different medium (e.g 3-2-1 strategy). \n\nBut I have two main problem with cloud storage: one it cost quite a lot, I recently reach 50\u20ac/month for only 6TB stored, when I use 32TB on my NAS for all the files. The second and most important issue is my upload speed. I peak at 3 mbps upload, which means that uploading 100GB can take days, or even more than 1 week. Making a backup of my whole NAS in the cloud would cost me way too much, and probably take more than a year of 24/7 upload (time during which I can't do anything else with my internet connection). \n\nThe cost problem could be mitigated thank to OVHCloud that now provide a cloud tape backup solution, which costs  0,0013\u20ac/GB. That would cost me 1/5 of what I pay currently. But this have some drawbacks, e.g. you can't add new file to the bucket, once it is archived to tape you have to create a new normal bucket and this make managing new vs old file a bit complicated for me. And it doesn't solve the upload speed. \n\nAnd alternative that I have concidered is LTO tape, but the hardware is insanely expensive, and I don't know much about it. This is solution that I'm interested thank to the write once feature (my 2 nas got hit by a ransomware 1 month apart in the past, luckily I had restore the first one when the second was hit, I have reinforced the security now). \n\nSo, if anyone with a super slow internet connection like I do have figured out a solution for off site backups at a reasonable price, I'm interested to know it. \n\nThank you.

I got an old Iomega NAS drive and the fan has died (I changed it 2 times to no avail). So now I'm trying to move data from the drive inside it to an external drive. Thing is, it gets hot without ventilation and after 30-60 minutes, it just hangs and I have to unpower it, give it time to cooldown and then continue. It's a bit long for a 2TB at 50gb each time.
