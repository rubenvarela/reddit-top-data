I've completed two internships, and I've been a Junior Software Engineer for more than a year and a half (currently I'm still working, trying to manage both my job and the university lectures and assignments in parallel). The languages/frameworks that I've worked with the most are Python - Django/FatsAPI, Ruby - Ruby on Rails, TypeScript - React (even if my perspective for this field is that I shouldn't be fixed on just some languages/standards, as the industry is evolving at such a rate, that from a month to the other we might find a new tool that's 100 times more efficient).\n\n- Up until recently I didn't ever interact that much with the concepts of Machine Learning, but since starting the Data Science degree I've realised that I like this field a lot and I take every Uni project as a challenge that I love solving.\n\nNow let's get to the actual issue at hand: in the next few months I would like to look for another workplace, since I've realized that the environment that I'm currently in is affecting me negatively and unfortunately I don't consider that this is a place where I can grow (both as an employee/software engineer as well as a person in general). If you'd like more info about the reasons, I can edit this post and add them, but I don't want to make this too long.\n\nAt this point, I don't really know what path to take: continue with the Software Engineering career or switch to Data Science / ML / NLP?\n\nI'm asking this from 2 distinct perspectives:\n1. which one of the two is better for my future? I've been reading different posts lately about some data scientists / ml engineers saying that this field is really volatile and a lot of companies switch strategies from one day to another and many find themselves unemployed out of the blue, besides the fact that some people say that there are already too many data scientists / ml engineers for the few jobs required. But thinking about all of the advances in AI that have been happening lately, I was under the impression that this field is going to thrive in the future.\n2. I have always believed that salaries in both fields are good, but as a data scientist / ml engineer you can reach a higher max salary compared to what the max salary of a software engineer can be (even if I've also read posts that stated the contrary).\n\nIf I want to be completely honest, I think that I already have the answer, since I like a lot what I'm studying and everything related to this field is just sooo captivating. \n\nBut my problem right now is that I've ve been able to get to a point where I'm competent enough as a software engineer to make enough money to support myself, so finding another job in the same field would be easier. Since my parents are not helping me financially anymore, I don't think I would be able to get by with the paycheck of an intern (around 800 Euros/month where I live), if I were to switch fields.\nAnd I don't think anyone would take me in this field for anything more than an internship, because I'm aware of the fact that I do not have enough experience in Machine Learning and Statistics for any other role.\n\nAs for some additional information that might be helpful, I'm in my early twenties and I live in Eastern Europe, where prices are not as high as in other places, but it's still not easy to get by by yourself.\nI've been also looking around for various opportunities in other countries in this field, in order to be able to work remotely or maybe do an internship there, but I haven't been able to find much.\n\nPS: I know that a lot of people might say that I'm young and that this is the best time to take risks, but going to an intern's salary would just expose me to the risk of being homeless, and that's not such a good option :D\n\nPS 2.0: I have also mentioned the NLP sector because it sparked my interest and I\u2019ve been taking some extra classes in order to gain some more knowledge about it.\n\nTLDR: which is the best career option between Software Engineering and Data Science/ML/NLP?", "author_fullname": "t2_uent8du4", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Which path is better: Data Science or Software Engineering?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1adt52s", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1706527632.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&amp;#39;m in need of some career advice, because honestly I&amp;#39;m at a point where I don&amp;#39;t really know how to proceed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some background info:\n- I&amp;#39;ve completed my Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in Computer Science (3 years degree), took a year of pause (during that time I just focused on work), and at the moment I&amp;#39;m in my first year (out of 2) of my Masters&amp;#39;s degree in Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for work experience, I started working during my second year of Bachelor&amp;#39;s as a Software Engineer.
