Some days after I got confirmation from the e-shop and shipper it arrived correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard drive model is still being sold and their stock fluctuates, so they seem to be selling them (no out of stock product).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have checked the HDD serial numbers on WD warranty site, and they are all OEM drives, so I only get a 2-year warranty from the seller (or no warranty at all as I am experiencing), instead of a 5-year warranty from the maker, which should be the case of products being sold to end-users (e-shop page does not claim it is an OEM drive and therefore it has a very limited warranty), but that is another war, as I only want to get my HDD replaced or reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The e-shop is &amp;quot;JACOB Elektronik GmbH&amp;quot; (jacob.de) , in case anyone is thinking abut buying anything from them, as it is a semi-scam site. No e-mail contact is possible in either address (&lt;a href=\"mailto:asp@jacob.de\"&gt;asp@jacob.de&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mailto:info@jacob.de\"&gt;info@jacob.de&lt;/a&gt;), despite having sent me emails from both addresses before I sent them back the HDD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from contacting the European Consumer office to legally address the case, is there anything I could try to do or contact to get some outcome from an e-shop that ghosts all my emails? I find 100 days for replacing/reimbursing a HDD long enough, ghosting apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1adek1i", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jfromeo", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 26, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adek1i/european_eshop_ghosting_me_for_100_days_after/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adek1i/european_eshop_ghosting_me_for_100_days_after/", "subreddit_subscribers": 728890, "created_utc": 1706479561.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I get the urge but it's way cheaper to only build a collection based on curated lists of movies for example.

Unfortunately in attempting to clarify this subject I did the exact opposite. Hence my attempt to start a new thread from scratch (too much datahoarding last week; I think my brain was fried).\n\nAlthough these differences might seem trivial, to those who have placed their data and trust in optical media for archival purposes (and thus expect reasonable longevity from the media) this stuff is actually data-critical. Hence I'm investing some time and effort in trying to get to the bottom of things.\n\n# LTH vs HTL\n\nLet's start with what's uncontroversial:\n\n**LTH = low to high = recording layer is organic** (like CDs and DVDs). BD-R LTH was attractive to the storage industry and they could only slightly modify existing CD and DVD production lines to churn out this media.\n\n**HTL = high to low = recording layer is inorganic** (like M-Discs). In Verbatim world, HTL involves the use of MABL (metal ablative recording layer). But MABL is not the only possible implementation of an inorganic recording layer for BD-X media.\n\nHere's how Verbatim describe **MABL** (I'm quoting verbatim - pardon the pun - from their marketing literature):\n\n*\"MABL: A specially created inorganic recording layer present on Verbatim's BD-R media ensures excellent recording compatibility and prolonged stability for archival life.\"*\n\nOrganic dyes - including AZO - are subject to ageing and deterioration. Dye degradation leads to lack of optical contrast which leads to lost data. It's widely believed that inorganic recording layers offer superior longevity (for MABL, I've heard 300 years thrown about. Mdisc famously claims a millennium.)\n\nThis doesn't mean that inorganic recording layers are guaranteed to be impervious to data loss. M-Discs's product literature suggests that the polycarbonate substrate may be a more vulnerable failing point than the recording layer itself. Presumably inorganic layers can degrade in other ways that would reduce the all-important optical contrast which holds the key to data preservation on optical media. But it seems overall like inorganic layers including metal alloys are better primed for the job of staying physically inert over time than their organic counterparts.\n\n# HTL / Inorganic Blu Rays vs. M-Discs\n\nAnd here's what I can surmise on this particularly controversial topic:\n\n***To the extent that the M-Disc and HTL Blu Rays are different, the differences probably have to do with differences in the composition of the inorganic layer***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nEven researching this subject briefly, you can find resources pointing to different alloys and composites that different manufacturers have used in their Blu-Ray products intended for archival.\n\nWhat's marketing speak? What's legit? The only truthful answer as far as I can tell is \"nobody knows.\" The M-Disc BD-R came to market in 2014, 10 years ago. At the time I'm writing this, we'd need to hop into a time machine and teleport 990 years into the future to test whether that claimed longevity was accurate.\n\nIs whatever's in the M-Disc truly better than whatever's in Verbatim's \"regular\" BD-R with MABL?\n\nI suggest that it's reasonable to assume that there's at least some difference. For a very simple reason. It wouldn't make sense for Verbatim to maintain the Verbatim M-Disc and regular Verbatim (HTL) BD-Rs as concurrent product lines if there were truly no differences. Of course, Verbatim could be duping us. But I would suggest that unless somebody can prove that to be the case by examining the products' material composition at the microscopic level that ... this level of skepticism and cynicism may be unwarranted.\n\nAnd what about the archival BD-Rs that Sony, JVC, Panasonic, and others have brought to market? Aren't these also engineered with inorganic recording layers? Yes they are!\n\nI suggest that all any of us can do is evaluate the technology on the basis of the best information available to us. Even if we were privy to the exact formulations of nanomaterials used in rival products, I'd suggest that this information wouldn't take us much further to the truth in trying to discern which product is the very best (because we'd still have to rely on the extrapolated calculations of accelerated ageing tests to determine truths).\n\nMight the most simple and reasonable advice be *\"pick a brand you like and trust and hope their claims live up to what's on the website?\"* It may actually be all any of us can do.\n\n# HTL vs. LTH Debate On Reddit\n\nThere have been [much discussed threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/8ihutc/100_of_bdr_bluray_disks_are_now_organic_lth/) on this sub alleging that all Blu Rays in circulation are low to high (LTH), organic media. So last week, I decided to reach out to Verbatim to ask whether their currently produced BD-R media is LTH or HTL.\n\n**Verbatim responded that they no longer make** ***LTH*** **Blu Ray media. Ie, all their Blu Ray media in production is** ***HTL.***\n\nIn retrospect, this seems to make abundant sense (and yes, assuming this is true, this means that the poster in the above thread is incorrect).\n\nMy current \"regular Joe\" Verbatim BD-Rs detect as HTL. But more importantly it seems as if the manufacturers collectively did something of a rethink about the sagacity of trying to use organic dyes in Blu Rays.\n\n***The chronology as I understand it goes something like this:***\n\n\\-&gt; Blu-Ray was originally standardised on HTL\n\n\\-&gt; In 2009-2010 Verbatim launch BD-R LTH using AZO as the recording dye. This BD-R was often marketed as \"Blu Ray LTH Type\" to differentiate it from HTL which was the original and thus \"standard\" BD-R. BD-R LTH proved finnicky with burner firmware and perhaps anoraks like us didn't like the regression that a move from inorganic to organic recording layers entailed.\n\n\\-&gt; In 20XX (I don't know the date) Verbatim seems to have quietly shelved the LTH idea and went back to making BD-R HTL media.\n\n\\-&gt; In April 2014 Milleniata launches the first Blu Ray version of the M-Disc (25GB).\n\n\\-&gt; In December 2016 Milleniata files for bankruptcy.\n\n\\-&gt; 2016 - present: Milleniata licenses its technology to Verbatim and Ritek. Verbatim produces the M-Disc as BD-R, BD-DL, and BDXL (100GB). Ritek initially makes M-Disc DVDs and BD-Rs before focusing exclusively on Blu Rays. Verbatim never manufactured M-Disc DVDs.\n\nThe trajectory of consumer-writable Blu Ray's is thus HTL -&gt; LTH -&gt; HTL. And at some point after we got back onto HTL the M-Disc came to market and was then subsumed into Verbatim's product lines.\n\nVerbatim (now a subsidiary of CMC) is of course only one of several disc manufacturers. You can still find BR-LTH discs on the market without too much trouble. Although I'm not sure why anybody would specifically want them.\n\n# My Closing Hot Take\n\n**Realistically, stability of digital data beyond 100 years is likely not necessary.** Thus whether technology A vs B can guarantee archival life of 100 or 1,000 years is a moot point. \n\nSince the advent of the digital age storage technology has rapidly evolved. It's reasonable to assume that the storage industry will have come up with a better solution for data permanence than Blu Rays in .... perhaps 30 years. \n\nWe hope and expect, of course, that this point will occur before the deprecation of optical media .. and that backward compatibility will enable us to get our stuff out of the old archival medium (Blu Ray) and onto its better successor ... hopefully with vastly greater data densities. \n\nI've heard it said frequently that LTO gets unreliable after about 30 years (max). For cold data preservation longer than that, optical media is (weirdly) basically what's out there. \n\nWhether you're putting your trust in archival grade CDs, DVDs, Verbatim BD-R or the M-Disc ... we'll do well to get 50 years of stable storage out of these things. \n\n*\\*All the above is correctly only to the best of my knowledge at the time of posting. This stuff certainly gets confusing. The definitive source of information about all this is probably the Blu Ray Alliance (BDA).

These two drives will be stored in plastic containers in a storage unit I have and labelled.\n\n\\- I will make a backup of the 4TB to a cloud service? (Advice needed)\n\nThe Master HDD drive + backup drive will then be wiped and recycled for the next 4TB of new media on the go. Rinse, repeat. \u2026 this should cover the 3-2-1 advice.\n\nHowever\u2026 I\u2019m struggling to find a cloud storage solution that is affordable and ticks off my requirements. Namely:\n\n\\- cheap\n\n\\- doesn\u2019t require my HDD to be connected to a PC periodically\n\n\\- doesn\u2019t have a min/max file size (I have documents that are KB in size, and other 300+ GB files)\n\nI won\u2019t ever need to access these files (unless the 2 SATA drives were both damaged). So I\u2019m looking more for a cloud archive solution.

These two drives will be stored in plastic containers in a storage unit I have and labelled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I will make a backup of the 4TB to a cloud service? (Advice needed)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Master HDD drive + backup drive will then be wiped and recycled for the next 4TB of new media on the go. Rinse, repeat. \u2026 this should cover the 3-2-1 advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However\u2026 I\u2019m struggling to find a cloud storage solution that is affordable and ticks off my requirements. Namely:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- cheap&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- doesn\u2019t require my HDD to be connected to a PC periodically&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- doesn\u2019t have a min/max file size (I have documents that are KB in size, and other 300+ GB files)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won\u2019t ever need to access these files (unless the 2 SATA drives were both damaged). So I\u2019m looking more for a cloud archive solution. Backblaze B2 seems to tick all the boxes, except it\u2019s coming at $288/yr which is currently too pricey for me.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there cheaper cloud options available?

I am expecting their needs to increase a bit, so if 5TB models are compelling (pricewise) compared to the 4TB ones, i wil spring for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was mostly looking at external HDD&amp;#39;s, with a usb-c connector (which is the connector they are slowly migrating towards) and a separate power connector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this sub i see a lot of recommendations for an internal HDD with a separate external enclosure. That would work (i would just put the hdd in the enclosure for them), but i don&amp;#39;t really know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any recommendation for either:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A good enclosure (and what to look for) +  internal drive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a good external HDD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any tips on this use case are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7eead6f2-b94e-11eb-af94-0e4c7cd4fb01", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1adayhx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shybearsecurity", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adayhx/looking_for_an_external_backup_drive_for_my/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1adayhx/looking_for_an_external_backup_drive_for_my/", "subreddit_subscribers": 728890, "created_utc": 1706470563.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I just spent two months going through thousands of pictures 1970s to 2000 and kept about 600.
