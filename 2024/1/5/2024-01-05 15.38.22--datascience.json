I\u2019ve done data analysis for a long time but mostly in media (where they mostly cared about exposure or traffic &amp;amp; time spent on site). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently started a job at a retail company with a heavy focus on sales/revenue. I have a marketing background and came in mainly to see how campaigns perform, but they \u201crestructured\u201d the department and now I\u2019m doing a lot of analytics on UX. I have no issue finding how many people come to the site and what pages they visit, but people only care about sales conversions here, which is new territory for me. I\u2019m getting questions like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; How many people watched a video on a specific page and then bought the item they watched the video of?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Who clicked this specific button on the frontpage and purchased stuff and what exactly did they buy?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; What is the revenue generated from each link in the header navigation (which has like 30 links)? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I primarily use GA and from what I can tell, eCommerce is categorized differently from click events and sales aren\u2019t directly linked. The numbers are also quite different than the actual products sold off our website (which I\u2019m sure others are aware of). I\u2019m seeing how retails is such a different beast than what I\u2019m used to as people can add a product to the cart from one page, go to other pages on the site, maybe click out and come back later (but the item will still be in their cart) and buy. There are so many factors involved that I can\u2019t tell a clear story\u2026 unless there is and I\u2019m just dumb? I\u2019m in so over my head and can use any advice.
