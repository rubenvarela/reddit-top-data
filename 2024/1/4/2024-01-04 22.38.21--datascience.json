title, I started my first data science job about seven months ago and I wanted to share my experience for anyone considering getting into the field.\n\nIt has been amazing so far! For the first time in my life, I can honestly say that I love my job.\n\nI'm a fully remote Data Scientist working for a big research university, and it's the best working experience I've ever had. My boss is super chill, always looking out for me, and makes sure I don't get overworked. They're also always encouraging me to use down time to keep learning, and to work on back burner projects that interest me and utilize all of my skills so I can keep sharp.\n\nAs for the work, I love getting to work with lots of data and to build/train models to provide actionable data insights and answer important questions - sometimes I feel like a detective. Further, I love my \"clients\" (university leadership), and they're always appreciative of my work (honestly, they seem to look at what I do like it's magic haha). I also feel like my work is actually useful and makes a difference for the university since it gets used in institution-wide decision making, accreditation, gets published on the website, etc.\n\nI love that they don't care \"when\" I work as long as the work gets done (i.e., I can run errands mid morning if I feel like it, etc.) - there's a ton of freedom/autonomy. And I love statistics/numbers, and I feel like I get to be somewhat creative. I will say, however, I'm in lots of Zoom meetings that should maybe be emails lol, but it's sometimes nice just to get a chance to talk to people since we're remote (I kind of feel like that's what the meetings are for).\n\nFinally, the pay and benefits are amazing. A lot of the time, I'm amazed by it lol (particularly since I came from a lower-paying, higher-workload and higher-stress field - clinical research - it's night and day).\n\nSo, how did I get into it? I'm doing my master's in DS and have a bachelor's degree in econometrics, but I also think the bulk of how I got the job was from doing projects and being able to show that I knew what I was doing via a portfolio/giving concrete examples of competency.
