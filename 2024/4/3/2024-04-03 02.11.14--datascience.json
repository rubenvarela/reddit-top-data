This metric is computed as the percentage of 1s in a binary column in our dataset. All of the other columns are categorical features, with varying cardinalities. Some might have 3 possible values, some dozens or even hundreds. \n\nI would like to perform Root Cause Analysis, so that I can tell my stakeholders \"Here's what's causing a decrease in the overall metric, go fix it\". However, all of the RCA content I find online handles numerical features, while mine are all categorical. And there's no trivial way to make them numeric, as in, there's no order applicable to their values.\n\nSo what I try to do currently, is look for 'segments' in the data that are underperforming. A segment means any combination of feature values over perhaps just 1, or some, or all features. I chose to call these 'segments', if there's a well-known term for this I would love to be corrected and educated.\n\nNow, since my features may have a high cardinality, the number of segments to look through is potentially huge, so an exhaustive search is off the table.\n\nQuestion number 1: Is this a common problem that has a known optimal solution? An algorithm or perhaps even a library that implements it that I can just use?\n\nSo here's what we did to solve this problem in our use-case, and I'd love to hear opinions or suggestions:\n\nWe one-hot encode all of our data, train an XGBoost (what else...) model on the whole dataset, then use SHAP values to extract the knowledge that our model gained. We recommend to our users the feature-value pairs with the highest mean SHAP values, as the most likely culprits.\n\nTo allow for some combinations to be looked at, we use our top 5 feature-value pairs as filters (one at a time), then run the same logic on each data subset. This produces 5 new top-SHAP feature-value pairs, and we do the same once again. This gives us at most 3 levels of combination. But, I worry that we might be missing other niche segments that are badly underperforming because we got to the 'niche' segments by drilling down from higher-level feature-values.\n\nAnyway, hopefully this isn't becoming too confusing.
