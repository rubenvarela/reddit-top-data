These got me wondering about a couple of statistical things about the driving data that's collected via these apps. \n\nSetting aside the ethics of not disclosing this kind of data collection (which is creepy), I was wondering whether the driving data actually helps model risk better. I could imagine two arguments: \n\n1- Driving behavior data helps because someone who is hard braking all the time is more likely to get into an accident. So knowing that someone hard brakes 3-4 times more than the average driver is a good predictor of risk. \n\n2- The additional data isn't actually useful because truly bad drivers get tickets and accidents, and hence the additional data from driving records don't add that much predictive signal above and beyond prior tickets and accidents. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone here work in these industries and have an informed take? It matters because my opinion about whether this kind of data collection should be legal or not really depends on the utility of it. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the US and I have zero sympathy for people who drive in a manner that endangers other people. But if the additional signals from this data really don't do that much to better price risk, it's not clear that the privacy concerns are worth it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\]: [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html)\n\n\\[2\\]: [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/technology/gm-lexis-nexis-driving-data.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/technology/gm-lexis-nexis-driving-data.html)\n\n\\[3\\]: Discussion of articles in the last 10 minutes of this podcast [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/podcasts/tiktok-princess-photoshop.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/podcasts/tiktok-princess-photoshop.html)", "author_fullname": "t2_5x1sf", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Anyone work in car insurance?
