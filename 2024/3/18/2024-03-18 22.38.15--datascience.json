I&amp;#39;m gonna use their products to illustrate my question but it&amp;#39;s for convenience&amp;#39;s sake, said company is just more actively promoting these new servers so they caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So obviously Nvidia&amp;#39;s H100 accelerators are being touted as one of the fastest for AI development. They even have a module that combines eight of these babies, it&amp;#39;s called HGX H100 8-GPU, you can see it in this server from the brand I talked about, Gigabyte: &lt;a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G593-SD1-rev-AAX1?lan=en\"&gt;G593-SD1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then Nvidia also has the famous &amp;quot;Grace Hopper&amp;quot; superchip, which is also available from Gigabyte (&lt;a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/High-Density-Server/H263-V11-rev-LAW1?lan=en\"&gt;H263-V11&lt;/a&gt;) but which seems to compete against its own H100 accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But wait, they&amp;#39;re not the only one to do this! AMD has MI300X accelerators (as seen on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G593-ZX1-rev-AAX1?lan=en\"&gt;G593-ZX1&lt;/a&gt;), but in &lt;em&gt;the same series&lt;/em&gt; they have the MI300A APU (as seen on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G383-R80-rev-AAM1?lan=en\"&gt;G383-R80&lt;/a&gt;), which is a CPU+GPU package lik the Grace Hopper, and also seems to be competing against its own sibling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My company is not quite up to training our own AI models yet but I want to be prepared in case I ever get asked to help make a choice. Dunno if you guys might have insight into my question? Thanks in advance. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ihWfBaxY26AYKtX6cKdc4lDBxPYLhgdC-AOewo5cRuA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=04e85d30002782c83057b344c5252b62d2254886", "width": 500, "height": 500}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ihWfBaxY26AYKtX6cKdc4lDBxPYLhgdC-AOewo5cRuA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f48fee836e781895e13e317ab514942dc2ed2cea", "width": 108, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ihWfBaxY26AYKtX6cKdc4lDBxPYLhgdC-AOewo5cRuA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47eb920954b60ec499351e0ab9e94be3d5ee71d6", "width": 216, "height": 216}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ihWfBaxY26AYKtX6cKdc4lDBxPYLhgdC-AOewo5cRuA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed073447586a1d744ff3d7194a71e282a01e8a0c", "width": 320, "height": 320}], "variants": {}, "id": "tmCM2uAT6c4fu_lnBPAhqujKWVACQGWQC7tUs-uwB7c"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#1a1a1b", "id": "1bhl2d7", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MauriceMouse", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1bhl2d7/an_embarassment_of_riches_in_terms_of_server/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bhl2d7/an_embarassment_of_riches_in_terms_of_server/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1434885, "created_utc": 1710747233.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I am currently working on a model that will predict if someone will claim in the next year, there is a class imbalance 80:20 and some casses 98:2.
