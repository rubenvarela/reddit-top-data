Where they will request robust analyses, looking at many different domain related metrics, but expect layman interpretable (their stakeholders) decks/deliverables. A specific example:\n\nA team of mostly clinicians wanted to look at around 20 metrics to assess the efficacy of one of their intervention programs. Some of these metrics are extremely domain specific and in some ways very opaque to those with little background on the subject. I conducted my analyses and created a deck highlighting the methodology I used and the topline outcomes. We used that deck to go through and discuss each and every outcome. Subsequently, I get asked to \"reinterpret\" the deck for a layman audience and \"use plain language\" to describe most of those 20 outcomes. \n\nOften times these comments come during the PowerPoint like, \"Great, I am glad we can see X effect/outcome due to this methodology, but I cant interpret X for my stakeholder due to this methodology. Can we add slides to describe the impact of this.\" It can be frustrating because it feels as if they are trying to jam-in several project stages into my stage of the project. \n\nOur data team realistically has limited time and resources and already has to \"say no\" to a lot of proposals and ideas. How can I temper expectations for these projects? I know I can give longer SLA estimates and explain why it is extended but I'm not sure how that will help with unrealistic expectations. My own opinion is that these teams are unloading some of what is their responsibility (using the data they request to make decisions and applying their own domain expertise) on us.\n\nAny other experiences with this?

Where they will request robust analyses, looking at many different domain related metrics, but expect layman interpretable (their stakeholders) decks/deliverables. A specific example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A team of mostly clinicians wanted to look at around 20 metrics to assess the efficacy of one of their intervention programs. Some of these metrics are extremely domain specific and in some ways very opaque to those with little background on the subject. I conducted my analyses and created a deck highlighting the methodology I used and the topline outcomes. We used that deck to go through and discuss each and every outcome. Subsequently, I get asked to &amp;quot;reinterpret&amp;quot; the deck for a layman audience and &amp;quot;use plain language&amp;quot; to describe most of those 20 outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often times these comments come during the PowerPoint like, &amp;quot;Great, I am glad we can see X effect/outcome due to this methodology, but I cant interpret X for my stakeholder due to this methodology. Can we add slides to describe the impact of this.&amp;quot; It can be frustrating because it feels as if they are trying to jam-in several project stages into my stage of the project. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our data team realistically has limited time and resources and already has to &amp;quot;say no&amp;quot; to a lot of proposals and ideas.
