The 'offline functionality' came in handy here as there was a massive wind storm during my visit, no power for 6 hours where my hotel was.  FYI, Latvia apparently doesn't really do 'water towers' so when the power goes out, even the toilet stops working because the building's pumps stopped dead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qg51txpgfsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f860ff3087f68b1b287b50ecf17659d41cb54da2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the ethnic food in Latvia and I just think that's funny. :D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5fwpa2ugsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a972d02ef2f5290f279c35d41e47a36141ba71f2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut let's get to the real test of 'offline media access' with the last trip I did in 2023: Via Rail's 'The Canadian'.  This is a 4350km journey, 96hrs, from Toronto to Vancouver, using Budd long distance passengers cars all built in the mid 1950's.  This thing is a legit time machine that takes you endless Canadian scenery with complete diner/kitchen cars, sleeper cars, dome cars, bars and lounges, it's amazing.  There is no wifi service what so ever and if you've ever looked at a map of Canada, we have massive stretches of 'nothing but nature'.  The train would sometimes go up to 12hrs between cell towers.  I woke up on the second morning, in a new time zone, and my phone was still reporting the last time zone we were in hours ago, I almost missed the last breakfast call in the diner car.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laqqeez4hsnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=565f91cb46744dddbb9ed3510d3a8b87b4fe905b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis train's bars close at 11pm and it dies down pretty fast after that.  Being more of a night owl with the train empty and everyone in their cabins or berths, I took to suspending the Steam Deck from the ceiling of my berth with a suction cup.  I had also brought a magnetic mount anticipating the metal of the interior to be steel but no such luck.  This is an upper berth with no window, so it was darkness of Steam Deck.  In this setup I also added an extra dongle that split the deck's USBC port, right angle, into both a USBC and USBA port, I was able to charge it while adding an IR dongle to use an IR remote.  Preferring to sleep closer to 2am, this was a pretty good entertainment setup.  Yeah, I slept with it hung over me, it stayed up just fine.  I had some folks elsewhere online ask 'Why don't you just do Plex (Or some other streaming option)?' situations like this are the answer.  When you own your files, you control your files, and you can take those files with you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ywehyr8hsnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07d9df63a2d1c61a1a0a1683d197e45a16138fa4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has nothing to do with data, but believe it or not, this train can access Reddit:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4r8r8qtaisnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bda18153b0bf161531e81e252e539c5d0758262b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yeah.  A fun demonstration of how having access to your own files, offline, and in a travel ready size, can be a useful asset when you're moving abroad.  Next stop, Spain in a couple of weeks. :)", "author_fullname": "t2_76pgn19", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Tiny Portable Hoard Goes Traveling",

earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is sorta an update to this thread;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/12qpgvv/a_large_tiny_portable_hoard/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/12qpgvv/a_large_tiny_portable_hoard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ll sum up that thread as follows; I installed Kodi on a Steam Deck, stuffed it&amp;#39;s MicroSD card full of aggressively compressed TV and movie files, so I&amp;#39;d have an all in one, handheld, dockable, gaming and media system that works while traveling and having no dependency on the internet, a &amp;#39;travel survival kit&amp;#39; if you will.  There&amp;#39;s over 4 months run time of TV and movies and months worth of gaming on it.  ...In that It has lots of games on it and I&amp;#39;m still just playing Civ5 and OpenTTD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a plane to Vancouver for Linus Tech Tips Expo in July.  Not a bad flight, only 5 hours, this episode of Strange New Worlds had just dropped over night so I dumped it on the card before heading to the airport.  Wifi on Air Canada is CAD$19.99 so we&amp;#39;re not paying for that.  The Coke was free though!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c9amqmfgdsnc1.png?width=3024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=493ccb578ac64b27cf0bcdd80dcf51152cffb499\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/c9amqmfgdsnc1.png?width=3024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=493ccb578ac64b27cf0bcdd80dcf51152cffb499&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hotel at LTX, which despite costing over CAD$300/night, had a consumer LG TV, 1360x768, and analog cable.  Vancouver in the summer, folks. Obviously I had internet access here so it was also able to stream and do YouTube, which was great cause they kicked any overflow from the WAN Show out of the venue and I had to walk back to the hotel to watch the rest of show that I was previously enjoying listening to from a beanbag at the nVidia booth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0rnxiystdsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=81335ac6ccf2d87cb404dd54b62dd96c5ca4baa4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0rnxiystdsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=81335ac6ccf2d87cb404dd54b62dd96c5ca4baa4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically all of the Home Lab guys from YouTube during a panel.  Interesting but the problem with panels like this is that no one really gets into the deeper topics, it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hl62zy15esnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3712952799c86f2f5614fb071da9b8610f7aac4d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hl62zy15esnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3712952799c86f2f5614fb071da9b8610f7aac4d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is another trip, off to Europe this time, to Latvia to visit the troops.  I flew with an airline employee, this was business class, I got to go for free, and the damn wifi was still an extra CAD$19.99.  I hear Air Canada&amp;#39;s next gen IFE&amp;#39;s will have an HDMI input and that&amp;#39;d be pretty awesome though I wonder if that will only be seen in the business class IFEs, till then, Deep Space Nine while I drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3kd8jvvsesnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9380f151719042e0f7e36a030073de541eeddfa9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3kd8jvvsesnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9380f151719042e0f7e36a030073de541eeddfa9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, I mean it, I visited the troops in Latvia, that&amp;#39;s a Canadian LAV behind and there&amp;#39;s also some Italian troops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nvtg5kl8fsnc1.png?width=3264&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c4c2564b3ce4c812d649b771c71f3ebe49cb9c90\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nvtg5kl8fsnc1.png?width=3264&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c4c2564b3ce4c812d649b771c71f3ebe49cb9c90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another hotel with no &amp;#39;Smart TV&amp;#39;, just cable where everything is in Latvian or Russian.  The &amp;#39;offline functionality&amp;#39; came in handy here as there was a massive wind storm during my visit, no power for 6 hours where my hotel was.  FYI, Latvia apparently doesn&amp;#39;t really do &amp;#39;water towers&amp;#39; so when the power goes out, even the toilet stops working because the building&amp;#39;s pumps stopped dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qg51txpgfsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f860ff3087f68b1b287b50ecf17659d41cb54da2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qg51txpgfsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f860ff3087f68b1b287b50ecf17659d41cb54da2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the ethnic food in Latvia and I just think that&amp;#39;s funny. :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b5fwpa2ugsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a972d02ef2f5290f279c35d41e47a36141ba71f2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b5fwpa2ugsnc1.png?width=4032&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a972d02ef2f5290f279c35d41e47a36141ba71f2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s get to the real test of &amp;#39;offline media access&amp;#39; with the last trip I did in 2023: Via Rail&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;The Canadian&amp;#39;.  This is a 4350km journey, 96hrs, from Toronto to Vancouver, using Budd long distance passengers cars all built in the mid 1950&amp;#39;s.  This thing is a legit time machine that takes you endless Canadian scenery with complete diner/kitchen cars, sleeper cars, dome cars, bars and lounges, it&amp;#39;s amazing.  There is no wifi service what so ever and if you&amp;#39;ve ever looked at a map of Canada, we have massive stretches of &amp;#39;nothing but nature&amp;#39;.  The train would sometimes go up to 12hrs between cell towers.  I woke up on the second morning, in a new time zone, and my phone was still reporting the last time zone we were in hours ago, I almost missed the last breakfast call in the diner car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/laqqeez4hsnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=565f91cb46744dddbb9ed3510d3a8b87b4fe905b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/laqqeez4hsnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=565f91cb46744dddbb9ed3510d3a8b87b4fe905b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This train&amp;#39;s bars close at 11pm and it dies down pretty fast after that.  Being more of a night owl with the train empty and everyone in their cabins or berths, I took to suspending the Steam Deck from the ceiling of my berth with a suction cup.  I had also brought a magnetic mount anticipating the metal of the interior to be steel but no such luck.  This is an upper berth with no window, so it was darkness of Steam Deck.  In this setup I also added an extra dongle that split the deck&amp;#39;s USBC port, right angle, into both a USBC and USBA port, I was able to charge it while adding an IR dongle to use an IR remote.  Preferring to sleep closer to 2am, this was a pretty good entertainment setup.  Yeah, I slept with it hung over me, it stayed up just fine.  I had some folks elsewhere online ask &amp;#39;Why don&amp;#39;t you just do Plex (Or some other streaming option)?&amp;#39; situations like this are the answer.  When you own your files, you control your files, and you can take those files with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3ywehyr8hsnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=07d9df63a2d1c61a1a0a1683d197e45a16138fa4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3ywehyr8hsnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=07d9df63a2d1c61a1a0a1683d197e45a16138fa4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with data, but believe it or not, this train can access Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4r8r8qtaisnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bda18153b0bf161531e81e252e539c5d0758262b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4r8r8qtaisnc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bda18153b0bf161531e81e252e539c5d0758262b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yeah.  A fun demonstration of how having access to your own files, offline, and in a travel ready size, can be a useful asset when you&amp;#39;re moving abroad.  Next stop, Spain in a couple of weeks. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false,

I hadn't thought to save their gallery (i was 13 lol) and ive been chasing those deleted images off and on for like a decade now. \n\nI've used archive.org, waybackmachine, reaching out to the artist personally (they deleted their art after posting to deviantart because bad computer storage) so I've sorta been SOL on this one. \n\nI managed to find some (VERYY low quality) screenshots from old slideshow videos and when I reverse image searched it appears Tineye has the full images and its original URL archived. The url is of course broken, and so the images just sits there mockingly unable to be saved in full resolution. It's still a win in my book though!! And it proves there's more out there. \n\nHere's the issue, in order to find an image on tineye you need to already have said image.

HDDs are Toshiba X300's, using an old upper end Z97 mobo with an i5 4690K and 16GB of DDR3. My home network is CAT6 throughout connected to a Dell PowerConnect 8024 providing 10GbE to the entire house, I have a smaller switch that does 2.5GbE and has a 10GbE SFP+ module installed between my \"modem\" and the PowerConnect to do translation since the Dell doesn't do multi-gig. I have AT&amp;T fiber with 2Gb service, and my main PC and the NAS have 10GbE cards in them.  \n\nRunning the NAS in RAID5 using btrfs. Been running this for years, started out using a 5.x.x version of DSM, rebuilt at some point on a 6.x.x version and was able to do an update, but haven't touched it in years at this point because of the hassle involved so it's out of date. I've enjoyed DSM for the simplicity of setting up the array and shares on it, as well as the ease of managing access. The difficulty in upgrading to the latest DSM and the lack of a simple torrent client without getting hacky are the main downsides. That and the limitation of number of drives using a standard case.  \n\nThis leads to the current situation:  \n\nMy work is getting rid of a Supermicro SC846TQ-R900B that the then Sr Sys Admin couldn't get back up and running (I fiddled with it for about a day and got it working just fine). It's packed with 24x2TB enterprise class SATA drives. It also has the original mobo (C7P67) which is running an i5-2300 CPU and was running with 4x2GB sticks which I bumped to 4x8GB sticks. It has 2 SAS controllers in it: an Areca ARC-1680ix and a Chenbro expander (I forget the model, but it's a s SAS2/SATA III unit). 2 ports on the 1680ix go to the backplane, the third goes to a port on the Chenbro, the remaining 4 on that fill out the rest of the backplane.  \n\nI plan to take this home. Both of the 900w PSUs are in working condition, the chassis is also in great condition other than the cover is missing. One thing I noted and wasn't keen on is that I couldn't get a read on the drives with Crystal Disk Info. HWInfo was able to read them though, and it shows one drive connecting at full 6Gbps, one connecting at 3Gbps, and the rest showing as 6Gbps @ 1.5Gbps, which is concerning, but I'm thinking may just be an issue of the software trying to read through the cards. The system is currently running WIn10 and has all the drivers installed to work with everything. The RAID BIOS is configured to have them run at full speeds. In the end, this should be irrelevant. My plan is to pick up a BPN-SAS3-846EL1 to upgrade to SAS3 capability (future use) and remove the cable spaghetti between the backplane and the fans by changing to a pair of  SFF-8643 to SFF-8643 cables. I'm also looking at replacing the current RAID cards with a single LSI 9300-8i card flashed to IT mode, there are some for \\~$15 on ebay and if those are not a great idea, the same cards can also be had for closer to $50, though they often seem to be the same make/model card at a higher cost). I'm looking at changing over to using FreeNAS/NAS4free/TrueNAS/XigmaNAS/etc. (not really sure which I'll go with, I plan to play with them all and see what fits before migrating my data off the xpenology rig) and would be replacing the existing mobo with something a little beefier and capable of holding 64 to 128GB of RAM (based on what I am reading of ZFS reqs). It will also be a move to using a Linux distro like Ubuntu server or something, which will be good for forcing me to learn more in that arena. It's still largely just a file dump but being able to install a proper torrent client so I don't need to leave my primary PC on 24/7 for that would be great. Being able to host VMs and other stuff is a future concern that would be nice to be able to easily grow into.\n\nI basically want to know if my hardware upgrade choices in the backplane and the RAID card, etc. are feasible or if I am missing something that may have me running into trouble. I've done a bit of research and feel like I have it, but I know enough to know I don't know enough about this to be certain.

My home network is CAT6 throughout connected to a Dell PowerConnect 8024 providing 10GbE to the entire house, I have a smaller switch that does 2.5GbE and has a 10GbE SFP+ module installed between my &amp;quot;modem&amp;quot; and the PowerConnect to do translation since the Dell doesn&amp;#39;t do multi-gig. I have AT&amp;amp;T fiber with 2Gb service, and my main PC and the NAS have 10GbE cards in them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running the NAS in RAID5 using btrfs. Been running this for years, started out using a 5.x.x version of DSM, rebuilt at some point on a 6.x.x version and was able to do an update, but haven&amp;#39;t touched it in years at this point because of the hassle involved so it&amp;#39;s out of date. I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed DSM for the simplicity of setting up the array and shares on it, as well as the ease of managing access. The difficulty in upgrading to the latest DSM and the lack of a simple torrent client without getting hacky are the main downsides. That and the limitation of number of drives using a standard case.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This leads to the current situation:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My work is getting rid of a Supermicro SC846TQ-R900B that the then Sr Sys Admin couldn&amp;#39;t get back up and running (I fiddled with it for about a day and got it working just fine). It&amp;#39;s packed with 24x2TB enterprise class SATA drives. It also has the original mobo (C7P67) which is running an i5-2300 CPU and was running with 4x2GB sticks which I bumped to 4x8GB sticks. It has 2 SAS controllers in it: an Areca ARC-1680ix and a Chenbro expander (I forget the model, but it&amp;#39;s a s SAS2/SATA III unit). 2 ports on the 1680ix go to the backplane, the third goes to a port on the Chenbro, the remaining 4 on that fill out the rest of the backplane.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan to take this home. Both of the 900w PSUs are in working condition, the chassis is also in great condition other than the cover is missing. One thing I noted and wasn&amp;#39;t keen on is that I couldn&amp;#39;t get a read on the drives with Crystal Disk Info. HWInfo was able to read them though, and it shows one drive connecting at full 6Gbps, one connecting at 3Gbps, and the rest showing as 6Gbps @ 1.5Gbps, which is concerning, but I&amp;#39;m thinking may just be an issue of the software trying to read through the cards. The system is currently running WIn10 and has all the drivers installed to work with everything. The RAID BIOS is configured to have them run at full speeds. In the end, this should be irrelevant. My plan is to pick up a BPN-SAS3-846EL1 to upgrade to SAS3 capability (future use) and remove the cable spaghetti between the backplane and the fans by changing to a pair of  SFF-8643 to SFF-8643 cables. I&amp;#39;m also looking at replacing the current RAID cards with a single LSI 9300-8i card flashed to IT mode, there are some for ~$15 on ebay and if those are not a great idea, the same cards can also be had for closer to $50, though they often seem to be the same make/model card at a higher cost). I&amp;#39;m looking at changing over to using FreeNAS/NAS4free/TrueNAS/XigmaNAS/etc. (not really sure which I&amp;#39;ll go with, I plan to play with them all and see what fits before migrating my data off the xpenology rig) and would be replacing the existing mobo with something a little beefier and capable of holding 64 to 128GB of RAM (based on what I am reading of ZFS reqs). It will also be a move to using a Linux distro like Ubuntu server or something, which will be good for forcing me to learn more in that arena. It&amp;#39;s still largely just a file dump but being able to install a proper torrent client so I don&amp;#39;t need to leave my primary PC on 24/7 for that would be great. Being able to host VMs and other stuff is a future concern that would be nice to be able to easily grow into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I basically want to know if my hardware upgrade choices in the backplane and the RAID card, etc. are feasible or if I am missing something that may have me running into trouble. I&amp;#39;ve done a bit of research and feel like I have it, but I know enough to know I don&amp;#39;t know enough about this to be certain.
