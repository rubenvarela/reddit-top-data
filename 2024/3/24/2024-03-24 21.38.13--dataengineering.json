Previously, I've worked with AWS but approach was waaay different, also I worked in a company that used Snowflake and BigQuery + GCS at another. This new role introduces me to a range of AWS services like Lambda, EC2, Kinesis Data Stream, Kinesis Firehose, Glue, Redshift, DMS, EMR, and more.\n\nIn my previous experiences, we always had code versioning and CI/CD processes using tools like Jenkins or GitLab. Usually, I would create a feature branch from the development branch, commit changes, and push them. After a review, the CI/CD system would handle the deployment to the development environment, and later to production. Production was managed solely through CI/CD pipelines.\n\nHowever, in my current role, the approach is different. Instead of uusing CI/CD for deployments, my team directly writes and tests code on AWS, starting with development tables (code testing), then moving to a staging tables (data validation I guess?!) before deploying to production. This methodology seems to bypass the traditional CI/CD pipeline approach (hands OFF the PROD).\n\nI'm grappling with the concept of having only one AWS environment (production) and testing everything there directly. It raises questions about the necessity of CI/CD. If the Lambda function works in the development environment, does that mean it will work in production without any additional checks or safeguards?\n\nIn my previous experience with Airflow, we maintained separate development and production environments. Changes were tested in the development environment, and upon approval, they were merged into the production branch triggering builds, tests, and deployments automatically and DAGs would be present on Prod without me ever laying a hand on it.\n\nI'm curious to hear about your experiences with implementing code versioning and CI/CD on AWS using GitLab or GitHub. How does your company handle these processes?

Previously, I&amp;#39;ve worked with AWS but approach was waaay different, also I worked in a company that used Snowflake and BigQuery + GCS at another. This new role introduces me to a range of AWS services like Lambda, EC2, Kinesis Data Stream, Kinesis Firehose, Glue, Redshift, DMS, EMR, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my previous experiences, we always had code versioning and CI/CD processes using tools like Jenkins or GitLab. Usually, I would create a feature branch from the development branch, commit changes, and push them. After a review, the CI/CD system would handle the deployment to the development environment, and later to production. Production was managed solely through CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, in my current role, the approach is different. Instead of uusing CI/CD for deployments, my team directly writes and tests code on AWS, starting with development tables (code testing), then moving to a staging tables (data validation I guess?!) before deploying to production. This methodology seems to bypass the traditional CI/CD pipeline approach (hands OFF the PROD).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grappling with the concept of having only one AWS environment (production) and testing everything there directly. It raises questions about the necessity of CI/CD. If the Lambda function works in the development environment, does that mean it will work in production without any additional checks or safeguards?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my previous experience with Airflow, we maintained separate development and production environments. Changes were tested in the development environment, and upon approval, they were merged into the production branch triggering builds, tests, and deployments automatically and DAGs would be present on Prod without me ever laying a hand on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious to hear about your experiences with implementing code versioning and CI/CD on AWS using GitLab or GitHub.

I&amp;#39;m more worried about having to learn all new keyboard shortcuts and like....using the mouse and sending emails and working in web based IDE&amp;#39;s lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "1bmj249", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bjogc42069", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/1bmj249/windows_to_mac_switch/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1bmj249/windows_to_mac_switch/", "subreddit_subscribers": 171447, "created_utc": 1711281471.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "I'm about to start my Data Engineering journey.
