It's running only a filesharing lxc atm, but there are some plans to expand this, e.g. Home Assistant, Invoice Ninja, Volumio, Wireguard, PiHole.  \nAlso I have a second server running on a different location, that hosts our Nextcloud on a VM and also Home Assistant. That is an oldish sff Desktop. The two networks are connected via the Wireguard VPN on the Fritz!Boxes, which is painfully slow. That's why I want to switch the VPN to a self hosted VPN on the servers.  \nFor data, on my main server at home I run an almost completely filled up WD Red WD40EFRX with 37k hours on it. Partial backups from years ago on some old 3TB and smaller HDDs, but no parity :( The Nextcloud uses a WD Red 1TB.  \nWhat would be the most sensible way to get this whole setup to a completely backed up solution?   \nIn the long term I'd like to run TrueNAS Scale with Raidz1 on both locations and keep the main storage backed up to the second location, while the Nextcloud there gets backed up to my homeserver. I figured, that 4x3-4TB drives would be the way to go. The servers themself will be upgraded in the long run to more modern, powerful and energy-efficient systems.   \nOnly problem: I'm not able to buy 800\u20ac worth of HDDs before fall or winter this year. Even then it would probably happen step by step.  \nWhat I'm currently thinking: back the 2x 3TB HDDs + the smaller ones with the backups to a Google Drive folder (if possible encrypted, they are also not completely filled)  \nThen create a MergerFS + SnapRaid pool and transfer the data from the main fileshare and Google Drive, while also checking for duplicates in the dataset.  \nAfter that enter the 4TB drive into the pool.

It&amp;#39;s running only a filesharing lxc atm, but there are some plans to expand this, e.g. Home Assistant, Invoice Ninja, Volumio, Wireguard, PiHole.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlso I have a second server running on a different location, that hosts our Nextcloud on a VM and also Home Assistant. That is an oldish sff Desktop. The two networks are connected via the Wireguard VPN on the Fritz!Boxes, which is painfully slow.

HDDs are Toshiba X300's, using an old upper end Z97 mobo with an i5 4690K and 16GB of DDR3. My home network is CAT6 throughout connected to a Dell PowerConnect 8024 providing 10GbE to the entire house, I have a smaller switch that does 2.5GbE and has a 10GbE SFP+ module installed between my \"modem\" and the PowerConnect to do translation since the Dell doesn't do multi-gig. I have AT&amp;T fiber with 2Gb service, and my main PC and the NAS have 10GbE cards in them.  \n\nRunning the NAS in RAID5 using btrfs. Been running this for years, started out using a 5.x.x version of DSM, rebuilt at some point on a 6.x.x version and was able to do an update, but haven't touched it in years at this point because of the hassle involved so it's out of date. I've enjoyed DSM for the simplicity of setting up the array and shares on it, as well as the ease of managing access. The difficulty in upgrading to the latest DSM and the lack of a simple torrent client without getting hacky are the main downsides. That and the limitation of number of drives using a standard case.  \n\nThis leads to the current situation:  \n\nMy work is getting rid of a Supermicro SC846TQ-R900B that the then Sr Sys Admin couldn't get back up and running (I fiddled with it for about a day and got it working just fine). It's packed with 24x2TB enterprise class SATA drives. It also has the original mobo (C7P67) which is running an i5-2300 CPU and was running with 4x2GB sticks which I bumped to 4x8GB sticks. It has 2 SAS controllers in it: an Areca ARC-1680ix and a Chenbro expander (I forget the model, but it's a s SAS2/SATA III unit). 2 ports on the 1680ix go to the backplane, the third goes to a port on the Chenbro, the remaining 4 on that fill out the rest of the backplane.  \n\nI plan to take this home. Both of the 900w PSUs are in working condition, the chassis is also in great condition other than the cover is missing. One thing I noted and wasn't keen on is that I couldn't get a read on the drives with Crystal Disk Info. HWInfo was able to read them though, and it shows one drive connecting at full 6Gbps, one connecting at 3Gbps, and the rest showing as 6Gbps @ 1.5Gbps, which is concerning, but I'm thinking may just be an issue of the software trying to read through the cards. The system is currently running WIn10 and has all the drivers installed to work with everything. The RAID BIOS is configured to have them run at full speeds. In the end, this should be irrelevant. My plan is to pick up a BPN-SAS3-846EL1 to upgrade to SAS3 capability (future use) and remove the cable spaghetti between the backplane and the fans by changing to a pair of  SFF-8643 to SFF-8643 cables. I'm also looking at replacing the current RAID cards with a single LSI 9300-8i card flashed to IT mode, there are some for \\~$15 on ebay and if those are not a great idea, the same cards can also be had for closer to $50, though they often seem to be the same make/model card at a higher cost). I'm looking at changing over to using FreeNAS/NAS4free/TrueNAS/XigmaNAS/etc. (not really sure which I'll go with, I plan to play with them all and see what fits before migrating my data off the xpenology rig) and would be replacing the existing mobo with something a little beefier and capable of holding 64 to 128GB of RAM (based on what I am reading of ZFS reqs). It will also be a move to using a Linux distro like Ubuntu server or something, which will be good for forcing me to learn more in that arena. It's still largely just a file dump but being able to install a proper torrent client so I don't need to leave my primary PC on 24/7 for that would be great. Being able to host VMs and other stuff is a future concern that would be nice to be able to easily grow into.\n\nI basically want to know if my hardware upgrade choices in the backplane and the RAID card, etc. are feasible or if I am missing something that may have me running into trouble. I've done a bit of research and feel like I have it, but I know enough to know I don't know enough about this to be certain.

such important things, only to be able to access those files through the network. house and something important is that most likely I will not have it 24/7 but I will use it from time to time that is why I come looking for an opinion/recommendation\n\nI don't know which could be the best possible option between a NAS or a RAID, I just bought an old enclosure which can store 4 hard drives and also has CD/DVD rom ports that I plan to replace with something so I can put more drives in that space, the components I'm still thinking about also because the type of cabinet has the power supply on top, making my options a little limited.\n\nFinally, the motherboard and the processor that came with that old computer are just as limited, I tried to install a version of Windows XP and the motherboard did not detect my USB, I tried to install it through a DVD disk and it didn't either, finally I tried with a HDD partition and it didn't work either\n\nIs there a motherboard and processor that you recommend?\n\nI'm sorry if it's a long post, I really tried to search for information on Google but there are a lot of divided opinions and that stops me most of the time", "author_fullname":

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been looking to store different types of files in the largest storage possible (Files such as movies, flac music, images, etc.) the point is that it would not be to save such important things, only to be able to access those files through the network. house and something important is that most likely I will not have it 24/7 but I will use it from time to time that is why I come looking for an opinion/recommendation&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know which could be the best possible option between a NAS or a RAID, I just bought an old enclosure which can store 4 hard drives and also has CD/DVD rom ports that I plan to replace with something so I can put more drives in that space, the components I&amp;#39;m still thinking about also because the type of cabinet has the power supply on top, making my options a little limited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the motherboard and the processor that came with that old computer are just as limited, I tried to install a version of Windows XP and the motherboard did not detect my USB, I tried to install it through a DVD disk and it didn&amp;#39;t either, finally I tried with a HDD partition and it didn&amp;#39;t work either&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a motherboard and processor that you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if it&amp;#39;s a long post, I really tried to search for information on Google but there are a lot of divided opinions and that stops me most of the time&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort":
