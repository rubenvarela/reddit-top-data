However, a shocking amount of people don't realize how risky it is to use chat GPT, because of the amount of data that they collect from you and store on their servers.\n\n\nHere is some quick info on some of the data that is collected using chat GPT (below). This is a shocking, truly startling amount of data, a lot of which is personal. People don't realize this, and they think they can just upload whatever the heck they want into chat GPT, proprietary code, personal information, documents with identifying personal info on it, Excel documents, Microsoft word documents, people are putting everything into chat GPT because they think their data is secure\n\n\n\n&gt; Does ChatGPT save your data? Yes, it does \u2013 and it probably saves more of it than you realize.\n\n&gt; ChatGPT collects both your account-level information as well as your conversation history. This includes records such as your email address, device, IP address and location, as well as any public or private information you use in your ChatGPT prompts.\n\n&gt; But ChatGPT also saves the data you provide, which includes: Account information, including your name, email address and contact details.\nUser content, including the information you use in prompts and the files you upload. The data you provide is used to help OpenAI train the ChatGPT model to become better at answering questions and helping users. \n\n\nThe only AI model that I have used regularly and trust is Claude from anthropic. Here's what they have to say about privacy, below. \n\n&gt; We will not use your Inputs or Outputs to train our models, unless: (1) your conversations are flagged for Trust &amp; Safety review (in which case we may use or analyze them to improve our ability to detect and enforce our Acceptable Use Policy, including training models for use by our Trust and Safety team, consistent with Anthropic\u2019s safety mission), or (2) you\u2019ve explicitly reported the materials to us (for example via our feedback mechanisms), or (3) by otherwise explicitly opting in to training.\n\n\n\nNotice one thing in particular about anthropic versus open AI policy! Anthropic says that they do not store any of your data or use it for model training. Chat GPT on the other hand, stores everything. They will store personal information, they will store your documents, they will store full names, addresses, any sort of information that's accidentally put in there, they will just store it all and use it all for model training....And let me be clear. I'm not someone who buys into conspiracy theories or fear-mongering. But any company that stores your data, has a huge, massive risk of losing it later. Data breaches and the like. \n\n\n**Also important to note that open AI has partnered with Microsoft, a for-profit company** \n\n\nThis part is extremely important to be aware of, because open AI is no longer operating in a full non-profit capacity anymore. All of the personal data and sensitive information that has been stored by their algorithm and is now on their server, is accessible by Microsoft, and potentially other companies in the future that open AI enters into a partnership with. Never mind the fact that they shouldn't even be storing sensitive and personal data on their servers or using it in training to begin with, but they are also providing it to Microsoft and other companies that use Open AI as a baseline....\n\n\n\n\n\n**So in conclusion, I feel that chat GPT is a very, very risky service to use for anything**. Any service that stores huge amounts of your data should be very heavily scrutinized. I am strongly against any company that uses sensitive or personal data and claims to be a non-profit, but then partners with a for-profit company and hand over all of their data to them\n ", "author_fullname": "t2_hdeet8zsc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "More people need to be aware of how risky it is to use Chat GPT/Open AI ", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_1bew3we", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "AI", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1710450519.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of people who are new to the data science and services industry, or are attending college for programming, computer science, information systems have likely used AI, probably chat GPT.

Here&amp;#39;s what they have to say about privacy, below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We will not use your Inputs or Outputs to train our models, unless: (1) your conversations are flagged for Trust &amp;amp; Safety review (in which case we may use or analyze them to improve our ability to detect and enforce our Acceptable Use Policy, including training models for use by our Trust and Safety team, consistent with Anthropic\u2019s safety mission), or (2) you\u2019ve explicitly reported the materials to us (for example via our feedback mechanisms), or (3) by otherwise explicitly opting in to training.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice one thing in particular about anthropic versus open AI policy! Anthropic says that they do not store any of your data or use it for model training. Chat GPT on the other hand, stores everything. They will store personal information, they will store your documents, they will store full names, addresses, any sort of information that&amp;#39;s accidentally put in there, they will just store it all and use it all for model training....And let me be clear. I&amp;#39;m not someone who buys into conspiracy theories or fear-mongering. But any company that stores your data, has a huge, massive risk of losing it later. Data breaches and the like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also important to note that open AI has partnered with Microsoft, a for-profit company&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This part is extremely important to be aware of, because open AI is no longer operating in a full non-profit capacity anymore. All of the personal data and sensitive information that has been stored by their algorithm and is now on their server, is accessible by Microsoft, and potentially other companies in the future that open AI enters into a partnership with. Never mind the fact that they shouldn&amp;#39;t even be storing sensitive and personal data on their servers or using it in training to begin with, but they are also providing it to Microsoft and other companies that use Open AI as a baseline....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So in conclusion, I feel that chat GPT is a very, very risky service to use for anything&lt;/strong&gt;. Any service that stores huge amounts of your data should be very heavily scrutinized. I am strongly against any company that uses sensitive or personal data and claims to be a non-profit, but then partners with a for-profit company and hand over all of their data to them&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2f731e52-70eb-11ee-bec5-5a5142e6a4d2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#46d160", "id": "1bew3we", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "databro92", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1bew3we/more_people_need_to_be_aware_of_how_risky_it_is/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bew3we/more_people_need_to_be_aware_of_how_risky_it_is/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1422936, "created_utc": 1710450519.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI was asked to figure out if I can come up with a method to discover specific relations between the variables in the dataset we have.
