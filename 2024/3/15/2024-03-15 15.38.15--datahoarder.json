My question is, what would yall recommend getting in my case?  I want a 4 bay device as I currently have 3 drives and would like to add one more for some extra space down the road.  Just go with a Synology?  Or something else entirely?  I know there are other types of devices like the  TerraMaster D5-300C that cost quite a bit less than a full blown NAS.  Budget wise...I would like to stay under 500.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1bevu2p", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Snikwah5", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1bevu2p/looking_for_direction_or_opinions/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1bevu2p/looking_for_direction_or_opinions/", "subreddit_subscribers": 738945, "created_utc": 1710449845.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I reported several posts (yes, I'm THAT guy!) for Rule #1 and they're quickly gone.

Particularly for nearly continuous recording of multiple HD video streams? Has anyone tried this long term, perhaps for years at a time? Was it detrimental to the SATA drives in any way?\n\nI figure this is the best place to ask since there are most likely people here who've experimented with doing something like this. If you want to know why I'm asking about this, read on:\n\nI want to buy one last internal drive for a TV archival computer that's already nearly full of drives. It doesn't have anymore available SATA connections, but it does have free SAS connections on its HBA Card. And yes, it already also has a 8 SATA port expansion card, but that's already full, along with all 10 SATA ports on its motherboard. And no, I can't use USB, because this is meant to be an internal hard drive that gets directly recorded onto, and the risks are far too great of it getting accidentally disconnected, not to mention how fickle USB connections tend to be in both fidelity and bandwidth.\n\nI'd much rather buy a refurbished 20 TB SATA HDD than spend over $150 more on a brand new 20 TB SAS HDD.\n\nBut I'm terrified that I might end up with the same bad situation I got the last time I tried connecting a high capacity SATA III drive to my computer's SAS II HBA for long term use. After just a few days of near continuous use, the drive started having severe issues and I had to quickly rescue the TV recordings on it and retire it. After connecting it to a proper SATA connection on a different computer, the SMART diagnostics were inconclusive: its Uknown Attribute 22 went into the red, according to GSmartControl. To this day, I still don't know what that attribute means, and whether it was a manufacturing fault with the drive itself, or if connecting any SATA drive to a SAS controller just isn't kosher, at least for near continuous recording of multiple HD video streams.\n\nAs far as I know, my computer's SAS HBA is perfectly functional.

Particularly for nearly continuous recording of multiple HD video streams? Has anyone tried this long term, perhaps for years at a time? Was it detrimental to the SATA drives in any way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figure this is the best place to ask since there are most likely people here who&amp;#39;ve experimented with doing something like this. If you want to know why I&amp;#39;m asking about this, read on:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to buy one last internal drive for a TV archival computer that&amp;#39;s already nearly full of drives. It doesn&amp;#39;t have anymore available SATA connections, but it does have free SAS connections on its HBA Card. And yes, it already also has a 8 SATA port expansion card, but that&amp;#39;s already full, along with all 10 SATA ports on its motherboard. And no, I can&amp;#39;t use USB, because this is meant to be an internal hard drive that gets directly recorded onto, and the risks are far too great of it getting accidentally disconnected, not to mention how fickle USB connections tend to be in both fidelity and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d much rather buy a refurbished 20 TB SATA HDD than spend over $150 more on a brand new 20 TB SAS HDD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m terrified that I might end up with the same bad situation I got the last time I tried connecting a high capacity SATA III drive to my computer&amp;#39;s SAS II HBA for long term use. After just a few days of near continuous use, the drive started having severe issues and I had to quickly rescue the TV recordings on it and retire it.
