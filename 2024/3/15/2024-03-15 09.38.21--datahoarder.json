I'd like to point the community's attention towards the following issue.\n\nIn an unprecedented act of digital vandalism, Nintendo decided to rm all levels from Super Mario Maker 1, because they hate people who like their games. That's over 100 million creations from regular users like you and I. This is obviously a huge loss to gaming history and to gamers in general.\n\nSome software exists to back this up, but not fully, there's no easy way to load the backups to check them, and there is no recent dump.\n\nThere's [this tool by PretendoNetwork](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/archival-tools/tree/master/super-mario-maker) but that's ways off from actually having the levels playable in an emulator or on a console. Worst of all there's no way to tell if it currently works because there's no tool for *loading* levels dumped this way.\n\nThere's also [this tool by HerobrineTV](https://github.com/HerobrineTV/SMM1-Level-Downloader) and a post [here](https://archive.org/details/super_mario_maker_courses_202105) that explains what's involved in getting dumps done with their tool to register inside a WiiU. That post is on a dump that also contains a bunch of courses, as I understand.\n\nI believe HerobrineTV's and PretendoNetwork's tools both capture different kinds of data *and* different kinds of metadata.\n\nSomeone actually has to run those tools and get all that stuff. It requires a working nintendo login - I don't have that right now, my Wii U is in storage in one of a million boxes. I'd have started myself already.\n\nThere's a partial dump of some sort that's [on archive](https://archive.org/download/smm_levels), but it's from early 2022 - so a lot of levels are going to be missing. The author of that dump stopped at close to 70 million levels, but that's not all. Note on this dump: the first 10 000 levels are dumped in some other format that does not actually include the level data; further levels seem to contain that level data, but bear in mind that the .torrent file available on that archive page does not include those dumps, so you'll have to download all those 6-12 GB files via http(s).\n\nThat dump also doesn't seem to include level screenshots, and I believe pretendo's tool doesn't get them. Also, that dump was made using an older version of the tool, which exports less metadata.\n\nGiven the size of that partial dump (around 600-800 GB), my guess is a full dump would be on the order of 1-2TB. It's not a LOT lot, but it's quite a lot, so work has to be done in parallel by multiple people to ensure this goal is met before end of March. \n\nHowever it bears keeping in mind that the older dumps will contain levels that have since been deleted. So they are still worthwhile and worth incorporating.\n\nRuTr has a release of SMM2 Switch with a loader tool, but I don't know how different the loader tool would have to be made to make it load levels into SMM1. It looks like everyone just focused on SMM2 sideloading, so SMM1 needs help with software dev to even ensure the backups work at all.\n\nA library tool of some sort would be useful, too.

It took about 3 days total but I&amp;#39;ve managed to recover some small photos, screenshots, mp3s and flacs just from those two drives. However the failed drive refuses to even be recognized by the operating system. Some motherboards I&amp;#39;ve tried it on refuse to complete the POST as it knows that the drive has failed and will display an error saying to remove the drive and reboot. It makes a horrible clicking sound when the computer is powered on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had success with a data recovery firm to recover data from a drive that&amp;#39;s failed in such a way? (I&amp;#39;m not going to try recover the data myself since I don&amp;#39;t trust myself with that). I&amp;#39;ve recovered a significant amount of data, more than I could ever hope for free.
