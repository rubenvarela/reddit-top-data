They essentially buy and flip companies like a real estate investor buys and flips houses. They've recently (in the past few years) spun up a data science org. My understanding is that the responsibilities of this role would entail assisting the deal team in commercial due diligences of prospective investments, assisting in portfolio operations and consulting on advanced analytics for the portfolio companies, as well as company wide data science initiatives. My impression was that this role would not be very involved in deal sourcing.\n\n# My Background\n\n* FAANG Senior DS\n* Worked in management consulting in the past - primarily as a data science consultant for Silicon Valley tech companies but also did a commercial due diligence project with our M&amp;A practice as a DS consultant\n* Ivy League masters in CS / Top 20 undergrad\n\n# Application Process &amp; Experience\n\n* I first cold applied online\n* After a short period of time I received an email from a Carlyle recruiter with a link to a 2 hour Hackerrank exam. I did not first receive any introductory call or even an introductory email - just an email with a URL to Hackerrank.\n* I decided to take the exam. It consisted of:\n   * One SQL (medium / window functions)\n   * One Python (leetcode easy)\n   * Discrete probability (e.g. probability of making a full house if you randomly draw 5 cards from a standard deck)\n   * Domain specific data science questions (e.g. how would you apply data science to this private equity problem)\n   * Overall I felt comfortable with all aspects of the exam and felt that it was well within my wheelhouse\n* After completing the exam I sent a note to the recruiter. They scheduled a call with the \"senior recruiter\" for end of week\n* The call with senior recruiter was fairly standard and covered the nature of the team, responsibilities of the role, and my background. I thought the call went well and was under the impression that I'd be moving forward in the process  (though I've learned never to take what recruiters say at face value)\n* At the end of the call the senior recruiter asked if I had taken the Hackerrank exam yet. I was a bit surprised that they did not already know the answer to that question.\n* After exactly one week of radio silence since the initial call, I emailed the first recruiter to let them know that I had seen some progress in my other searches (true) and asked if my application was still in consideration. I did not receive a response to this email.\n* I waited one more week (two weeks since the initial call and about three weeks since I took the exam) and emailed the senior recruiter for a status update.

I can only speculate as to why. I'm leaning towards them just being highly disorganized.\n* For future applicants I strongly, strongly advise not taking their HackerRank exam unless you don't mind having your time wasted. I'm willing to bet nobody at Carlyle even looked at my test responses.\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\n\nIt seems a lot of you think that ghosting is professionally acceptable.
