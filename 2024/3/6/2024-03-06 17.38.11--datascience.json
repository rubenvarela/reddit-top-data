I would be required to be at the office about 50% of the time and attendance is tracked using some app. The tech stack is somewhat out of date but modernizing it would be part of my tasks. Here I could learn a lot about several different domains of machine learning and data science. \n2. Position 2 is at a former startup which was recently bought by a larger company. I would have 100% wfh and a very modern tech stack, however my work would focus strongly on a very narrow range of models which are interesting to one single industry.
