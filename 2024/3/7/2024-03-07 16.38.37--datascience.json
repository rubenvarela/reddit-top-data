Apparently I did soo poorly I got handed a rejection a few hours later, so I wanted to know what you guys think of this problem, how you would solve it, if it's even an appropriate DS question etc...\n\nThe problem goes something like this: You are a data scientist that works at an e-commerce platform that sells experiences at Paris (think bicycle rides, wine tours, etc...). The company doesn't own any products but rather takes a commission from every product sold.\n\nYou have access to a table of 500 such products (for Paris only) that has columns like title, category, review count, review avg, price, duration, when it was posted, etc... (maybe 2-3 more but these seem more like internal IDs that don't really matter). The three questions we went over before she gave up on me were:\n\n1. How would you pick 1-2 metrics from this column to sort these listings? (To build a quick formula for ranking these listings)\n2. What are some disadvantages of this approach?\n3. How would you predict that the rankings will change in 6 months from today (assuming I implemented my strategy)?\n\nMy answers where:\n\n1. I would pick the review avg and count. normalize the count, like minmax so that it is in the same range as the review avg, and weight the review count and review avg by a alpha and (1 - alpha) for example. Should have I picked price instead of review count?
