Continued updates will be posted on RoosterTeeth.com, but you can also reach out and submit questions or feelings to our Support Page. We will be hosting a livestream tomorrow, March 7, 2024 at 4pm CT on RoosterTeeth.com talking about this more.  \n\n\n&gt;*Dear Rooster Teeth,*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Since our founders created and uploaded their first video on the then-called World Wide Web in 2003, Rooster Teeth has been a source of creativity, laughter, and lasting innovation in the wildly volatile media industry.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*We\u2019ve read the headlines about industry-wide layoffs and closures, and you\u2019ve heard me give my perspective and updates on the rapidly changing state of media and entertainment during each of our monthly All Hands meetings.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Since inheriting ownership and control of Rooster Teeth from AT&amp;T following its acquisition of TimeWarner, Warner Bros. Discovery continued its investment in our company, content and community. Now however, it\u2019s with a heavy heart I announce that Rooster Teeth is shutting down due to challenges facing digital media resulting from fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and monetization across platforms, advertising, and patronage.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Please note, the Roost team is not currently impacted by this action as the Roost Podcast Network will continue operating and fulfilling its obligations while WBD evaluates outside interest in acquiring this growing asset.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*We have many questions to answer in the coming days and weeks, and the opportunity to work together to implement the best way to wind things down for us and our community. We\u2019re working through what comes next in real time, and we will be as open, direct, and accessible as possible.  Thank you all in advance for your patience and support of one another.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Let's take a moment to celebrate our 21-year contribution to the zeitgeist, advancing creativity and outlasting many of our peers from the early days of online video and digital-first content.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;***TO A CREATIVE LEGACY***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*From a garage in Buda, TX, to global screens large and small, our teams of dreamers and doers have introduced and grown what made Rooster Teeth stand out: animation, comedy, and gaming. From new forms of animated comedy with machinima to countless viral memes, including the Immortal Snail (aka Snail Assassin), to a US-born animated series embraced by Japan as anime, and record-breaking (at the time) crowdfunded movies. You've accomplished so much and made dreams come true here. You've turned original IP into video games, comic books, and VTubers. You've directed short videos, mo-cap, and films. You've puppeteered, hosted podcasts, and have built a thriving community that spans the globe. Your creativity knows no bounds, and you'll continue contributing significantly to culture wherever your paths may take you.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***TO THOSE WHO COME FIRST***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Despite passing through many corporate owners, Rooster Teeth transcended a media business and was a dynamic movement that shaped the bond between communities, creators, and storytelling. Our founders didn\u2019t have a blueprint for a media empire, but they got close to building one alongside a community that fueled its remarkable growth. In its earliest days, RT relied on community sponsorship through time, dollars, and unwavering passion. Volunteers evolved into staff, and the snowball effect grew, resulting in new relationships, marriages, births, and shared experiences that have changed lives.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;***TO TRAILBLAZING CONTENT CREATION***   \n*Our approach to content creation on emerging platforms paved the way for new media models. We inspired generations of creators across streaming, machinima, animation, let\u2019s plays, merch drops, touring, podcasting, and more. Companies like GameStop, YouTube, Facebook, Spotify, and TikTok asked us to collaborate with them in their earliest days because we set a standard for what a digital-first brand could be. We boldly took our content beyond screens and into community-driven experiences.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;***TO A CHANGING INDUSTRY***  \n*Every story reaches its final pages. Rooster Teeth\u2019s closure isn\u2019t merely an end; it reflects broader business dynamics. Monetization shifts, platform algorithms, advertising challenges, and the ebb and flow of patronage\u2014all these converging factors have led to many closures in the industry. While we learn about updates on programming day by day, we will share our plans for shows, franchises, partnerships, and merch soon and share those updates with teams internally and with the community on RoosterTeeth.com*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***TO OUR FINAL SEASON***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Though not intentional, It\u2019s only appropriate that our last season of \u201cRed vs. Blue\u201d coincides with us navigating this closure together. Our legacy is not just a collection of content but a history of pixels burned into our screens, minds, and hearts. Rooster Teeth has made an indelible mark on the media industry, and we should be so proud of the countless ways we pioneered a business connecting creators and content with a dedicated community.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*With respect, gratitude, and sincere appreciation,*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Jordan Levin*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll leave it in the capable hands of the Mods here to decide where conversation happens - whether it\u2019s here or a stickied post (we\u2019re using #goodbye-RT in the RT and DB Discords).

While we learn about updates on programming day by day, we will share our plans for shows, franchises, partnerships, and merch soon and share those updates with teams internally and with the community on RoosterTeeth.com&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TO OUR FINAL SEASON&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though not intentional, It\u2019s only appropriate that our last season of \u201cRed vs. Blue\u201d coincides with us navigating this closure together. Our legacy is not just a collection of content but a history of pixels burned into our screens, minds, and hearts. Rooster Teeth has made an indelible mark on the media industry, and we should be so proud of the countless ways we pioneered a business connecting creators and content with a dedicated community.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With respect, gratitude, and sincere appreciation,&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jordan Levin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll leave it in the capable hands of the Mods here to decide where conversation happens - whether it\u2019s here or a stickied post (we\u2019re using #goodbye-RT in the RT and DB Discords). More information will be shared on RoosterTeeth.com as they are decided. Take the time you need to process. Don\u2019t lash out, don\u2019t speculate. No one specific instance caused this. Every single person at Rooster Teeth is being affected and we are eternally grateful for the support and love that you have graced us with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;br/&gt;\nChels&lt;br/&gt;\nHead of Community &amp;amp; Support Operations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-rv4LAxUUQKrlSPY8u1JPkkQxug5KH98nYs3GtHXHpw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5602b748c98c6f6e1958350c91ac33097b430f01", "width": 640, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-rv4LAxUUQKrlSPY8u1JPkkQxug5KH98nYs3GtHXHpw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e84381241a63128bea8646277d6170d23ea7efc8", "width": 108, "height": 60}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-rv4LAxUUQKrlSPY8u1JPkkQxug5KH98nYs3GtHXHpw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672b9520834fde540ac3d7ddabc624232d9853d5", "width": 216, "height": 121}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-rv4LAxUUQKrlSPY8u1JPkkQxug5KH98nYs3GtHXHpw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8122627e4c52d4cfd0b3c1b74a9d076346a4f5e3", "width": 320, "height": 180}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-rv4LAxUUQKrlSPY8u1JPkkQxug5KH98nYs3GtHXHpw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d77f7cea84294850aa4324ecec9a90858a15c7", "width": 640, "height": 360}], "variants": {}, "id": "4TPYj2uAtOrgSuN76FxBszwfamrY2t7MyFrlj09-3HE"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "6c3ea6bc-5a34-11ee-8f29-120c9a5b7e40", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": ":Rooster17: Chelsea Atkinson -

From what I've read so far I suppose I'm probably a lightweight data hoarder compared to most people here.\n\nI'm retiring a 4 year old Seagate Barracuda 4TB that developed bad sectors (everything had been backed up so no data loss worth mentioning). Meanwhile my main WD 6TB drive containing most of my video data is filled to the brim. I have been looking into internal SATA drives that are at least 10TB in size. I'm sensitive to noise while power consumption and long lifespan are concerns as well (not mentioning prices, they are what they are nowadays). Since speed is of little concern to me I always stuck with 5400-5900rpm drives. Unfortunately those seem to be non-existent above 8TB.

From what I&amp;#39;ve read so far I suppose I&amp;#39;m probably a lightweight data hoarder compared to most people here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m retiring a 4 year old Seagate Barracuda 4TB that developed bad sectors (everything had been backed up so no data loss worth mentioning). Meanwhile my main WD 6TB drive containing most of my video data is filled to the brim. I have been looking into internal SATA drives that are at least 10TB in size. I&amp;#39;m sensitive to noise while power consumption and long lifespan are concerns as well (not mentioning prices, they are what they are nowadays). Since speed is of little concern to me I always stuck with 5400-5900rpm drives. Unfortunately those seem to be non-existent above 8TB. Unless I&amp;#39;m missing something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I found myself, and after reading this thread (&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/15hqcla/who%5C_makes%5C_the%5C_quietest%5C_hard%5C_drives%5C_1014tb/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/15hqcla/who\\_makes\\_the\\_quietest\\_hard\\_drives\\_1014tb/&lt;/a&gt;), I suppose WD Red Plus are probably the best option for me, even though I wish their 10+TB drives weren&amp;#39;t 7200rpm.
