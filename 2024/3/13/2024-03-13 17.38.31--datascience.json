DataScience community,\n\nSo I'm grappling with a challenging phase in my career. I'm currently a data scientist with &lt;1 YOE and I've noticed a gradual shift in my responsibilities. More of my time is now spent on data engineering and Python software development than on the data science and analytics work that aligns with my passion and educational background. While I value the learning opportunities this provides, I fear drifting further from the core data science and machine learning roles might be detrimental in the future (I know the market is horrible and I'm not trying to picky, but the future outlook is the main concern for me). I have a year of experience as an analyst (excluding research roles during undergrad) and my current position increasingly feels misaligned and title-inflated due to which I've been actively looking for new DA/DS/ML roles.\n\nThe job market's current state is undeniably tough. Still, in recent months, I've reached the final interview stages for six different data science and analytics positions. Each time, I felt a strong connection with the interviewers and was optimistic about my chances (I honestly thought that an offer was coming for sure since it all went so well, that now I realize I was being naive), only to be passed over with 0 feedback on where I might have fallen short.\n\nThis pattern has led me to question whether the issue lies with the market or with me. Maybe it's my performance in these crucial final stages that's costing me these opportunities. However, without specific feedback, pinpointing and addressing any potential shortcomings is very challenging; like I don't even know what to improve if it's a me problem. To that end, I'm reaching out to this community for any insights, advice, or shared experiences that might help me navigate this situation. How do you handle similar setbacks? Any strategies to secure a role in such a competitive market?
