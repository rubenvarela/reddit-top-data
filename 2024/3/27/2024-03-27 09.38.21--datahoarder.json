The initial plan was to insert one 10gbe FSP+ card (wich I did) but now I think to swap that with two PCIe to m.2 NVMe adapters and move the OS to those drives, so I can free up the HDD bays. As for the HDDs - I think to put 8 4TB drives for storage and 4 512GB/1TB sata SSDs which will serve as cache/metadata storage. Since the CPU doesn't support virtualization I'll use that NAS only for storage. \n\nWhat do you think - what's the limit for the raw storage size, since the maximum RAM for that machine is 8GB?

Luckily after a simple &amp;quot;firmware&amp;quot; update it&amp;#39;s working again. Right after that I decided to test if I can install any other newer &amp;quot;NAS oriented&amp;quot; OS, different from the original and outdated &amp;quot;Debian based Lenovo stuff&amp;quot;. The test was successful with the latest beta version of &amp;quot;TrueNAS Scale&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m curious what are the limits and what to do. The hardware is as follows: Intel Core2Duo E8400, 4*2GB DDR2 non-ECC memory, 4 1gbe ports, 2 PCIe 2.0 x8 ports/slots (on a riser card) and integrated RAID controller with weird backplane - 8 SATA/SAS ports and 4 SATA only. The initial plan was to insert one 10gbe FSP+ card (wich I did) but now I think to swap that with two PCIe to m.2 NVMe adapters and move the OS to those drives, so I can free up the HDD bays. As for the HDDs - I think to put 8 4TB drives for storage and 4 512GB/1TB sata SSDs which will serve as cache/metadata storage. Since the CPU doesn&amp;#39;t support virtualization I&amp;#39;ll use that NAS only for storage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think - what&amp;#39;s the limit for the raw storage size, since the maximum RAM for that machine is 8GB? Should I use smaller 2TB HDD drives or I can put larger ones - 8TB, 10TB, even bigger?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1bo600s", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "virtunea", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1bo600s/ix12300r_bringing_back_to_life/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1bo600s/ix12300r_bringing_back_to_life/", "subreddit_subscribers": 741112, "created_utc": 1711454016.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hi:\n\nThis would be my first experience with LTO tapes.
