I've done so for the past five years, and everything is pretty much sorted out at this point. I am here to ask for advice related to my data hoard though, please hear my explanation, it may be a unique situation. I've done my own research &amp; am pretty knowledgeable, but it's been two years and I still haven't found an ideal solution, so that's why I'm coming here for advice. I appreciate your patience.\n\nAmong the usual life's worth of photos, movies, music, ancient software, media etc, my hoard is a complete collection of video game ROMs and disc images (ISOs) for every console. Near-complete libraries, and many rare and custom curated ROMs as well. I use this for hobbies and my side hustle, where I repair and mod game systems, often backing up data for customers to my 6TB SSD.\n\nRight now this data is on a 6TB Samsung 2.5\" SATA SSD which is inside my windows 10 laptop. It is not the OS boot drive.\n\nI have three full size 3.5\" SATA HDDs that are 6TB each. Two WD Blue and one WD Enterprise which I manually copy the SSD to with (awesome) teracopy software, using a two bay SATA USB3.1 dock which also has an offline cloning feature that I stopped using. This is not automated at all, and takes several days to copy &amp; verify checksum with teracopy. Because I'm on solar, I also suspend the Teracopy overnight and start it again where it left off every morning. This requires that I take time to deliberately update copies, and there doesn't appear to be an easy way with teracopy to \"update\" the copy to a mirror of the original drive. I have to either format and do it all again, or copy all the new data to the drive, no way to automatically remove data from the backup that is no longer on the original. (like if I were to prune out several redundant folders, for example)\n\nSo I'm looking for an automated solution. My goal is just to not have to worry about losing all this data, or over a month of work, and having to remember to manually copy &amp; monitor the process.\n\nI've tried many other methods, but haven't found anything ideal for my situation and lifestyle. Ideally I would have two of these HDDs connected in the usb dock, one being copied from the SSD weekly and the other being copied daily, whenever I have the dock powered on and connected.\n\nHere's some methods I've tried\n\n\\- mirrored volumes in windows 10 diskmgmt will not work because the HDDs I'm mirroring to are connected via USB\n\n\\- Windows 10 storage pools seems like it requires the drives to be empty before starting a RAID1 setup, and I don't think there's an option to have one drive copied to two external drives at the same time. Also I don't think it's possible to begin this process without losing data on the original drive to be copied, meaning I'd have to wipe everything, then move data from my sole remaining copy.\n\n\\- Easus and similar backup software trials I've tried create disk images that seems to always become corrupted, though the scheduling features seem pretty good.\n\n\\- Online backup is *not* an option. Most of the time I'm working with very slow internet speeds.\n\n\\- ~~NAS is not an option, there is no network that is always connected for me to create a NAS. I suppose that means I'm using DAS.~~  (edit: a NAS would be nice down the line but for now I'm restricted by budget)\n\n\\- It's not feasible nor is it possible for me to have *any* device that is always on 24/7. Like I said above, at night the devices are asleep, but often need to be fully powered off. Any devices drawing power could become a burden, even during the day, if it's the cloudy season. (I have enough power for another device, but it would need to make efficient use of power, and the more low-powered, the better.)\n\nOver the past couple of years doing manual backups, I've had some close calls &amp; hardware failures where I've gone to a month old backup and almost lost it all. Manually backing up this way is not reliable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(EDIT: An important portion of my OP was accidentally deleted while I was making final edits...

I'm planning to get a 2TB secondary SSD that I will be using for games, photos and most other things that don't necessarily benefit from the high NVME speeds. \n\nFurthermore, I'm trying to get as much out of this drive in terms of longevity as I will be able to. My laptop is 2,5 years old and I'll likely be using it for another 2-4 years. After that I will either build the SSD into a PC, or if I'm not going for a PC build and buying another laptop instead I'm guessing that it will probably not come with expansion space for a 2.5 inch drive. My plan then is to buy an enclosure from Amazon to turn it into a USB-C external drive that I will be using as a backup drive for photos, important files and also some less important files.

It's clear to me that I need a drive with TLC and not QLC, but does it need DRAM? For example there are SSDs like the Silicon Power Ace A55 which are TLC but without DRAM for 2/3 of the price.
