There are two databases which are on the same SQL server instance that references these databases but in their normal form without the _test after their name.\n\nMany of the stored procedures are fully qualified and they reference the specific databases on the server. There is about 50 of them. Instead of going into every single stored procedure manually and replacing Source with Source_Test manually you have been asked to implement dynamic solution.\n\nThe reason for this is because these stored procs are called by an SSIS package that holds parameters on a project level, so the variable's can be set in SQL Server using the environmental variables. At run time someone can enter the original database name and the name of whatever their test database is.\n\nSOLUTION :\nHere is what I did to fix this. Wrote a stored procedure in T-SQL that looks through every stored procedure on the server and replaces every mention of Source with Source_Test. It only look for information to the left of the first period in a fully qualified DB reference (which usually contains two periods) so it only looks at the database name. If the stored proc contains code that references Source they are all changed to Source_Test within the code of the stored procedure.\n\nThen I put this stored procedure at the top of a workflow in SSIS so it's the first thing the package commits. It uses the global variables in the SSIS project to hold the names of the input striking and output string for the search and replace proc.\n\nThen after the rename , all the processes in the SSIS package excute and then the same stored procedure is executed again, only with the input and output variables reversed. So everything goes back to normal.\n\n\nIve done this specific task in job titles completely different from the one I hold now. If you had this problem where would it go to ?

Trying to find out if I am doing something wrong.\n\nBackground start:\n\nI am pretty experienced in both DS and DE (open sourced DE libraries, published DS papers), and currently I started interviewing again (yes recession etc. but recruiters are relentless, salaries are ok, many of my current colleagues left, so I started looking).\n\nApart from heavy streaming applications which have some niche challenges to solve, I have worked in most industry-standard projects (data lakes, data warehouses, pipelines, libraries, analytics, ML research &amp; productionization etc.).\n\nCurrent DE stack includes almost everything a modern data stack uses, except databricks &amp; graph databases  (AWS, ec2 autoscaling clusters, postgres, snowflake, aurora, powerbi, docker, spark on prem (bare metal), spark on cloud (managed &amp; my own implementation), kinesis, some limited kafka, airflow, dagster, prefect, datalakes, a bit of trino clusters, MLFlow, sagemaker, queues, some limited ElasticSearch experience, blah blah) and knowledge is quite deep in most of them as well.\n\nFrom the ML side regressions, classifications, timeseries forecasting, clustering, anomaly detection, mixed integer programming, evolutionary algorithms, BUT NOT NLP/ Computer Vision/ Reinforcement Learning. I have some top20 finishes in Kaggle, and a couple papers published, as mentioned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't job hopped in years (was payed handsomely to stay with back2back huge payrises), so that red flag isn't raised for me.\n\nInterviewed with FAANGs earlier this year, and after getting one or two offers I rejected them as I sensed layoffs would be coming (in hindsight it seems I was correct).\n\nSo naturally I felt confident going into my current interviews.\n\nBackground end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I 've been dissapointed in my current interviews which usually span between 3 to 5 rounds (I only was rejected in the CV phase for ridiculous reasons you can find below, the rest reached final round, so huge time sinks):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Too senior (this was for a company critical position, salary was quite high for something less senior)\n\n\\- Not senior enough (Actual role was much less complex than in JD, proved it's just pipeline building, so I would actually be too senior for this role...)\n\n\\- Straight rejection from CV scan: Lacks lamdas knowledge (I list AWS ecosystem, S3, Kinesis, Athena, EC2)\n\n\\- Only has AWS knowledge (literally was told to get certifications for both GCP and Azure and come back when I have certs for all 3... Eh?)\n\n\\- Was drinking coffee during the interview (someone out of 10-12 people during a 7 stage 16 hour interview complained about it, the internal recruiter even named them... \"{insert name here} complained about you drinking coffee, apart from that your interviews were excellent.\")\n\n\\- Too expensive (was inside the budget range) -&gt; Was for a principal position, they ended up hiring a mid level (what the actual ...)\n\n\\- Lacks frontend experience (not even in the job description)\n\n\\- While you can dabble as DE and DS, which is great, you lack experience as a SWE using java (not in the JD)\n\n\\- While we said budget is that, it's actually half (no thank you, why do you tell me that after final interview)\n\n\\- We work remotely but once you join you need to go for 6 months in Sweden to help set up an analytics department there  (why do you tell me that after final interview)\n\n\\- Things changed, we won't actually hire anyone at this stage (why do you tell me that after the final interview)\n\n\\- With your current bundle of skills we would also expect strong DevOps experience (excuse me?)\n\n\\- Even though your technical skills seemed great, and we tested you in both DS and DE, I still can't believe that you have all those skills, therefore I reject you (this one had me furious for more than a week, as I really really wanted that position, which essentially asked for someone with DE &amp; DS skills)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the feedback itself which feels a copy-paste by now :\n\nSome of the strongest technical skills we have seen, excellent communicator/ problem solver/ would be a great fit for the team/ really cool guy.\n\nBut... (something from the above).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here? The reasons seem to be quite ridiculous and I am quiet upset since it happened again and again. Even had an external recruiter come back fuming to me and say I don't know what the f\\* is wrong with them but don't worry I ll line you up for other opportunities.

Trying to find out if I am doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background start:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am pretty experienced in both DS and DE (open sourced DE libraries, published DS papers), and currently I started interviewing again (yes recession etc. but recruiters are relentless, salaries are ok, many of my current colleagues left, so I started looking).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from heavy streaming applications which have some niche challenges to solve, I have worked in most industry-standard projects (data lakes, data warehouses, pipelines, libraries, analytics, ML research &amp;amp; productionization etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current DE stack includes almost everything a modern data stack uses, except databricks &amp;amp; graph databases  (AWS, ec2 autoscaling clusters, postgres, snowflake, aurora, powerbi, docker, spark on prem (bare metal), spark on cloud (managed &amp;amp; my own implementation), kinesis, some limited kafka, airflow, dagster, prefect, datalakes, a bit of trino clusters, MLFlow, sagemaker, queues, some limited ElasticSearch experience, blah blah) and knowledge is quite deep in most of them as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the ML side regressions, classifications, timeseries forecasting, clustering, anomaly detection, mixed integer programming, evolutionary algorithms, BUT NOT NLP/ Computer Vision/ Reinforcement Learning. I have some top20 finishes in Kaggle, and a couple papers published, as mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t job hopped in years (was payed handsomely to stay with back2back huge payrises), so that red flag isn&amp;#39;t raised for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interviewed with FAANGs earlier this year, and after getting one or two offers I rejected them as I sensed layoffs would be coming (in hindsight it seems I was correct).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So naturally I felt confident going into my current interviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I &amp;#39;ve been dissapointed in my current interviews which usually span between 3 to 5 rounds (I only was rejected in the CV phase for ridiculous reasons you can find below, the rest reached final round, so huge time sinks):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Too senior (this was for a company critical position, salary was quite high for something less senior)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Not senior enough (Actual role was much less complex than in JD, proved it&amp;#39;s just pipeline building, so I would actually be too senior for this role...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Straight rejection from CV scan: Lacks lamdas knowledge (I list AWS ecosystem, S3, Kinesis, Athena, EC2)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Only has AWS knowledge (literally was told to get certifications for both GCP and Azure and come back when I have certs for all 3... Eh?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Was drinking coffee during the interview (someone out of 10-12 people during a 7 stage 16 hour interview complained about it, the internal recruiter even named them... &amp;quot;{insert name here} complained about you drinking coffee, apart from that your interviews were excellent.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Too expensive (was inside the budget range) -&amp;gt; Was for a principal position, they ended up hiring a mid level (what the actual ...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lacks frontend experience (not even in the job description)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- While you can dabble as DE and DS, which is great, you lack experience as a SWE using java (not in the JD)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- While we said budget is that, it&amp;#39;s actually half (no thank you, why do you tell me that after final interview)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- We work remotely but once you join you need to go for 6 months in Sweden to help set up an analytics department there  (why do you tell me that after final interview)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Things changed, we won&amp;#39;t actually hire anyone at this stage (why do you tell me that after the final interview)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- With your current bundle of skills we would also expect strong DevOps experience (excuse me?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Even though your technical skills seemed great, and we tested you in both DS and DE, I still can&amp;#39;t believe that you have all those skills, therefore I reject you (this one had me furious for more than a week, as I really really wanted that position, which essentially asked for someone with DE &amp;amp; DS skills)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the feedback itself which feels a copy-paste by now :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the strongest technical skills we have seen, excellent communicator/ problem solver/ would be a great fit for the team/ really cool guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... (something from the above).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong here? The reasons seem to be quite ridiculous and I am quiet upset since it happened again and again. Even had an external recruiter come back fuming to me and say I don&amp;#39;t know what the f* is wrong with them but don&amp;#39;t worry I ll line you up for other opportunities. And then it happened again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The technical interviews come as of easy (hardest was a specific leetcode hard for one of the FAANGs which made me sweat, did only half of it due to time constraints and got the offer) and interviewers seem genuinely impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never had issues with cultural fit in the past, I&amp;#39;ve worked with people much younger than me, worked with people much older than me, I presented to boards, was invited to conferences and guest lectures, formed strong connections inside and outside of work, so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s cultural fit.
