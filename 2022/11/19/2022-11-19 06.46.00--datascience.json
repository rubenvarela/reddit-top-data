This is my first reddit post, so please forgive me if this is not the place to be posting asking for advice/guidance.\n\nI wanted to turn to this community as I feel extremely alone. I have virtually zero network. I have a few family members/family friends who work in the tech industry, but not in tech roles. Aside from that, I don't have any peers, coworkers, or friends that I know who would understand my situation.\n\nI graduated with my B.S. in Statistics back in March of this year. I've been working in a very small, non-tech start-up (\\~7 employees, I am the only technical employee) as a \"data scientist\" since graduating. I say \"data scientist\" in quotes because I don't feel like I'm doing work of a data scientist. I'm super part time, \\~15 hours per week, paid minimum wage. I live in the Bay Area, CA - so minimum wage doesn't cut it. I worked as an unpaid intern for the company for about 9 months before graduating, and I only accepted the offer because I had nothing else lined up. I figured I'd take it temporarily while I actively seek a full-time role elsewhere. \n\nThe company has all of their data in Google Workspace, primarily Google Sheets. No databases, no cloud infrastructure. The company doesn't want to transition to anything else because they don't see a need. I tried convincing my boss to let me set up a database and they can keep their data in Sheets as well, but he doesn't see a need so he doesn't want to pay me to do that. He basically has me doing busy work, barely any data science at all. Projects are scrappy with no structure. Most of the time it's my boss proposing a business problem to me, and me being like \"hmm, how can I solve this with python\". I come up with some what of a solution, that works for that one use case and that's it. It never becomes a fully finished project because I don't have the resources to take it any further.\n\nI thought I'd get a few projects under my belt, create a portfolio, and find another job. I feel like I'm worse off now than I was 9 months ago when I graduated. I haven't built a single model, no dashboards, no databases/SQL, no stats, etc. I haven't used my stats skills since school and I feel like I'm losing them. With that being said, I'm very far from being prepared to do any technical interviews. I've applied to countless positions over the past 6 or so months, had 2 technical interviews but I didn't make it past the SQL rounds. \n\nThis job is absolutely consuming me and I'm feeling hopeless. I don't have time to work on personal projects, prepare for technical interviews, etc. I get paid for 15 hours of work per week, but I work well over 40+ hours, I have no time for anything. On paper, I have the degree, I have the \"work experience\" and a good reference from an employer, but I'm severely lacking the technical skills required for entry level roles -  like being able to solve a problem end to end, push a model into production, deployment, etc. Not a single project I've worked on has came full circle, so as of right now I have nothing to show for the work I've done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR;\n\nI feel stuck because I don\u2019t have time to work on anything else outside of this job. I don\u2019t feel like I have the sufficient skills to land another job. It's just taking every ounce of my motivation and energy. I'm desperately seeking a job I can grow in, and one in which I have people to turn to for support. \n\nMy question is 1, what should I do right now, should I quit this job and fully focus on building my portfolio/preparing for technical interviews? \n\nAnd 2, should I find any job in a tech company, start from the bottom and try to get into DS role from internally? Or would that result in a similar situation that I'm in now because I wouldn't be practicing and learning new stats/ML skills?\n\nI apologize for this being so long, I've been holding that in for a long time lol. I'm hoping to reach anyone out there who has been in a similar position and can give me their two cents.

I can&amp;#39;t seem to figure it out whether it&amp;#39;s the force of habbit, or I&amp;#39;m missing something important. I end up having several sandbox scripts, every py file has some random &amp;#39;if name==main&amp;#39; block to try out functions contained within, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is your workflow, as the project gets more complex and you have to maintain a stable code base?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yydh9b", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "statespace37", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/yydh9b/development_workflow_in_python_prototype_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/yydh9b/development_workflow_in_python_prototype_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 820272, "created_utc": 1668754197.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi everyone, am a beginner in the DS field and am going to start on a new project.
