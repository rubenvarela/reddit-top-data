everyone,\n\nI felt I just needed to get my words out into writing as it feels like a thousand thoughts are going through my head at the moment. For context, I have been with this organisation for just over 2 years now (18 months as D&amp;A Graduate, 10 months as a Data Engineer).\n\nI have been really enjoying my current role, having built production pipelines, assets, and even basically lead a Data Engineering sub-team for just over a month whilst the new DE lead onboarded and familiarised himself with internal processes. I know that when I'm properly in the zone (a bit corny), I can contribute greatly to key decisions like design / architecture and have that \"product\" mindset for Machine Learning use cases.\n\nI am now coming towards the end of support two ML use cases that are going into production, with work the naturally quietening down as we go into the December period. After coming out of the gym last night, I received a call from one of the DE leads who managed the team I was with in one of my placements during my graduate programme, telling me about this senior MLOps Engineer role and asking if I would consider applying for it.\n\nNow, I know I certainly wasn't the first choice given them have been trying to recruit these role for a while now with little success, however, to even be thought of for such a role I thought quite surprising. I told him that it would certainly be a role that I would be interested in given the experience I have had so far with these production use cases, and the thought process and decisions that need to be consider in order to actually productionise Machine Learning solutions for the business.\n\nI also think it would be a great time to join at this position as the team are very much at the early, early stages of their MLOps journey. So, I think it would be a great opportunity to be able to learn as I am doing it.\n\nHowever, and this is a big **however**, I have formally only been a Data Engineer for 10 months. I haven't had that much experience translating non-function business requirements into a design and implementation of a ML product. And my journey into cloud technologies has only just started.\n\nThis has just been a really ramble but I would love to see if anyone with more experience within the industry has thoughts to add to any of this?\n\n**Edit:** I also know that just because I'm because I'm being asked to consider applying, it does not guarantee that I will necessarily get the role.
