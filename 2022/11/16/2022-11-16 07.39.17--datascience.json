After having lost 3 family members during covid, including dad, I've been doing a lot of thinking about how life is short and whether it really is worth spending the finite time we have far away from family.\n\nSo, I've been looking for jobs in my home country - but either the pay is too low or I need to migrate to the big cities, which defeats the purpose of staying close to (with) family. Therefore, I'm now thinking of trying my hand at DA/DS/ML/AI consulting service.\n\nBut how do I go about setting it up? I set up multiple gigs in Fiverr, one for each subfield (NLP, CV, ML, etc), but I have so far only received 30-100 page views in 2 weeks, and 0 jobs. I've reduced the price of some of the gigs to as low as $5 (starting price), but even then I've received no paid jobs yet (I've had one guy approach me to help him for free on his project).\n\nObviously I lack marketing skills. So, do I need to find a marketing partner or hire someone to do the marketing for me? Is it worth paying Google ads for my Fiverr gigs? Or do I spend some time to create my own consulting website and do paid marketing for that, instead of the Fiverr gigs? If there's anybody here who has successfully set up their DS consulting gigs, any help, guidance and direction from you is much appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[All the project names in Fiverr start with \\\\\"I will\\\\\" for buyers, but in the seller dashboard \\\\\"I will\\\\\" is not shown](https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=2112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d304afb4f2311b1c9d0cb02d5b828a4313e7ac86)", "author_fullname": "t2_79v29l8u", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How do I go about setting up my own data analytics and data science consulting services?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 42, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"zf9h9jkod30a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 32, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33c526b0a8153a93f223be6594a1e1f8090aa16"}, {"y": 65, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e02372c657f1e890f882ea52c536233f02221204"}, {"y": 96, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7b9725a2a89a9acdfc1c0264d6ddc5d14f18c9d"}, {"y": 193, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4ecb394e9ff8f8799bc1e0478c3caf6f12b230"}, {"y": 290, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1530ad9097581915926579931fde717ee9517f45"}, {"y": 327, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd38cbcaa0742b7913c0629e08956c788bb623d5"}], "s": {"y": 640, "x": 2112, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/zf9h9jkod30a1.png?width=2112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d304afb4f2311b1c9d0cb02d5b828a4313e7ac86"}, "id": "zf9h9jkod30a1"}}, "name": "t3_yvsygw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jGUDUTFu_T_4SpWC1b65xlMR3bcKtAgit4y4FAgsX_8.jpg", "edited": 1668508196.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668507219.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in ML/AI in a different country than my own, so I live away from my family.

Data Analyst under a Senior Systems &amp; Data Analyst, who left in June. That means I am literally the only Data Analyst left on the team, with no backfill on the horizon. In addition, we had a complete data systems overhaul in May from our 40 year old mainframe system Old System to one I will just call New System. \n\nThese two events significantly shifted the scope of my responsibilities - now instead of me running and maintaining queries from Old System, I was charged not only to learn the design of New System, but also lead the data community at my institution for best practices and query \"recipes.\" In other words, I became \"the data expert\" overnight (because there was zero training for anyone and I happened to have a three months' advance period of playing with the test New System.)\n\nIn addition to playing the leadership role (presenting to large audiences, answering emails from a listserv to data users in the community,) I started facilitating connections with external offices, including our IT office that develops the intermediary data interface between New System and Native New System for our institution, and with our research office which handles regulatory reporting. There's been a lot of cruft work in simply organizing these meetings, taking notes, following up, and generally taking ownership of these new workstreams, given that my manager left, but I know that I'm actually digging deeper with these duties beyond what my previous manager did.\n\nSome of my bullet points of what I've been doing:\n\n* Handling a growing sector of ad hoc data requests\n   * More new requests from previous offices that have not requested data are coming in due to inexperience with New System. \n   * (There's a huge reliance on me to provide reports as even folks who are supposed to use the web user interface struggle and find my reports easier, like administrative people who aren't supposed to work with data at all, this is across like 15+ offices. Since this is just the volume of the work increasing, I don't really know if this would count for me in a raise/job description redux.)\n* Handling private and confidential data requests\n   * A lot of confidential, \"reputational risk\" data requests are coming to me now that the Senior Data Analyst is gone. Think requests from Legal.\n   * (Would this mean anything when trying to get a raise, and if so, what's the right language about it?)\n* Validating New System reports and queries against Native New System\n   * Investigate, write up Jiras, follow up with IT for critical upstream system issues that cause breaks downstream for staffs and students. Fix critical bug fixes\n   * (This was never in my job description and doesn't really fit a Data Analyst, is more Systems Analyst, yet has become 30% of my role since the migration. This is a beta testing, bug fixing job. In other words, if IT and our consultants did their jobs properly, I wouldn't be the one constantly finding bugs and delivering documentation on them.)\n* Growing sector of work in collaborating with IT, promoting data stewardship on campus\n   * As IT continues to come to this office and this data analyst as \"the\" data experts on campus, this office grows in leadership and visibility across offices. Our home office also gains more leverage on decisions made about New System and plays a critical role in data stewardship by presenting guidance to report users on which data elements to use and not to use appropriately in different settings.\n   * (My old manager was much less people oriented than me, so she never really did any of the strong collaboration stuff I'm doing.) \n\nDoes anyone have any more language I could use that would be helpful with management or HR? Especially around leadership, presentation, facilitation, data stewardship, but any areas?\n\nI don't care what role I get reclassed in as long as I get a raise, to be honest. I would like a 20% raise which I know could be achieved with Senior Data Analyst.
