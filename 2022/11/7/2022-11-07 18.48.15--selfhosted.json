clients wich gave me an internal addresse on their servers. As it is, I have currently 4 professional emails I need to check and reply frequently, which is bothersome to handle.\n\nI could use Gmail to handle this : setup a Gmail account, import the 4 addresses on it. I can receive all the mails (POP3), send as any of the addresse, when I reply it automatically choose which addresse to use, and have a custom signature for each addresse. And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it's google, privacy is an issue for work ... I have a home server, I'd like to have my own Gmail equivalent at home.\n\nI could use a desktop client, like thunderbird, but I use different computers, different networks, I need everything in a single place, I don't want to manager different thunderbirds configs, and some emails are deleted when pulled with POP3, so I would only have them at one place ...\n\nEmail forwarding would be easy, but I need to reply as the mail it was sent to, so I need multiple smtp ...\n\nI reviewed a few webmails to handle things:\n\n\\- Roundcube : only one account. I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?\n\n \\- Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn't seem to be a thing.\n\nI really did'nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it's own signature, with an android app to sync with.\n\nDo you guy know any webmail that could do that ?

And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it&amp;#39;s google, privacy is an issue for work ...

I&amp;#39;m fed up of email, much prefer using ntfy and all too often I set up a mail rule which hides a true positive because I&amp;#39;ve not thought the rule through :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone has set up something like Mailu to effectively be an internal only email service which can then be monitored and alerted on another way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or is there a better way to handle this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I want to have a way for an application I self host, in my homelab network, to use SMTP to create whatever notification it wants on a service which is also inside my network. I have no desire to stand up a mail service which can email out to the wider internet. Then I want to use that to trigger alerting through whatever method (figure this out later... ?)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yoqduh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ragnarkarlsson", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/yoqduh/mailu_or_similar_for_internal_only_email/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/yoqduh/mailu_or_similar_for_internal_only_email/", "subreddit_subscribers": 208763, "created_utc": 1667835035.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "There is some selfhosted service like DUDE from Mikrotik?", "author_fullname": "t2_4189y7w0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Network discovery", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yompp3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667827308.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some selfhosted service like DUDE from Mikrotik?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yompp3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "parmesanocheese", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/yompp3/network_discovery/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/yompp3/network_discovery/", "subreddit_subscribers": 208763, "created_utc": 1667827308.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
