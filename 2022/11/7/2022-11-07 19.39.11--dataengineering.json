I interned at a large F500 company and returned to work there for a total of 2 years. First half of my time there I learned a lot surrounded by several smart people but the organization and standards were bad. Worked frequently with contractors that were smart and could code solutions quick, but they and management did not prioritize things like source control, QA, code review, testing in dev first, CI/CD, etc. Thus my job ended up being a ton of putting out fires and frequent oncall of fixing bugs and reporting/manually restarting failures (few of us did our best to automate what we could). I ended up eventually hating the job once it became an oncall rotation of every 3 weeks and not learning anything new anymore and eventually left after getting an offer at fast growing startup doing more traditional backend development.\n\nStarted with good amount of work with hive/hadoop/sql/python/bash then AWS/python/sql/databricks/spark. Fairly comfortable in command line and unix. We used a pretty terrible legacy orchestration software and eventually ended up managing most of our ETL jobs with an internally built framework and cron jobs.\n\nAt next job I was there for a little over a year and it was heavy in AWS and tech stack was javascript, node, and lots of AWS services (dynamodb, lambda, sqs, etc.) Was pretty new to web development but learned a lot and went from lightly familiar with AWS to pretty familiar. Churned out API endpoints for different microservices and was surrounded by super smart people and great developers. Honestly felt a little overwhelmed by how lacking I felt but learned a good amount. Still felt fairly junior as I was great at implementing but very newb at technical tradeoffs and design. And I still am meh at javascript with 1 year of professional experience. Was introduced to a little front end work but I still know next to nothing besides basic react. Can do small bug fixes and very very basic implementations.\n\nAfter layoffs (and a move), ended up at super small startup as primary backend dev for our project for a few months now. Also overwhelmed in a different way as I have nearly no mentorship or guidance and am solo developing this project with no stories/tasks assigned to me. Basically I talk with PM on what requires they need, I try my best to translate the requirements and confirm with CTO, then start coding.  Lots of things changed while coding and not all my assumptions were correct so it's been difficult. Also it is a similar tech stack but it is javascript with node/express, mongodb/mongoose, and Azure. So still some learning curve on that side as well.\n\nI am starting to think I just didn't like the work environment at my first company but I did enjoy the work/tech itself. I love writing code in Python (still my favorite language despite not working with it professionally much the last 2 years) and I love creating scripts for automation. I find that the parts I enjoy most about my last few jobs were the few opportunities I was able to write small scripts to increase some inefficiency somewhere or something as simple as using it for initial load of a bunch of data to our db for testing. I like SQL as well though we used only very basic SQL at my last two jobs.\n\nI'm also not really enjoying web development. I think designing and building APIs is cool but that's about it. I also just don't like coding in JS much. Also there seems to be this constant nudge for me to do more full-stack work at both jobs but I just don't like working on front end or learning more about it.\n\nSomeone mentioned SRE to me but I don't think I really like getting any closer to the ops side. I don't think I'd be as interested in the role besides the scripting part.\n\n**tl;dr** if context was too long:\n\nIf I were to try to get back into data engineering, should I be targeting junior roles? I would say my Python is still decent, Spark almost completely forgot everything and I wasn't that great with it to start with, same for Scala. SQL is a little rusty but better than most software engineers and worse than most data engineers. I'm pretty quick at picking up new tech and technologies as I've been having to do that basically every job. All in all I have about 3 years experience with almost half of it being data engineering.\n\nIf I were to try to transition back, what should I focus on learning/revisiting (is it mainly know Spark now?) and what should I keep an eye out for in terms of teams/roles?\n\nMy ideal wishlist for a job:\n\n- Fully remote\n\n- 120k+ base salary\n\n- good mentorship and WLB\n\n- primary language is Python, don't mind using a little bit of others to get minor stuff done\n\n- AWS\n\n- no on-call or at least healthy on-call setup", "author_fullname": "t2_21k74213", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Going back into data engineering?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yoh15o", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667810533.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all looking to get some thoughts and advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started off my career out of college as a data engineer.

And I still am meh at javascript with 1 year of professional experience. Was introduced to a little front end work but I still know next to nothing besides basic react. Can do small bug fixes and very very basic implementations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After layoffs (and a move), ended up at super small startup as primary backend dev for our project for a few months now. Also overwhelmed in a different way as I have nearly no mentorship or guidance and am solo developing this project with no stories/tasks assigned to me. Basically I talk with PM on what requires they need, I try my best to translate the requirements and confirm with CTO, then start coding.  Lots of things changed while coding and not all my assumptions were correct so it&amp;#39;s been difficult. Also it is a similar tech stack but it is javascript with node/express, mongodb/mongoose, and Azure. So still some learning curve on that side as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am starting to think I just didn&amp;#39;t like the work environment at my first company but I did enjoy the work/tech itself. I love writing code in Python (still my favorite language despite not working with it professionally much the last 2 years) and I love creating scripts for automation. I find that the parts I enjoy most about my last few jobs were the few opportunities I was able to write small scripts to increase some inefficiency somewhere or something as simple as using it for initial load of a bunch of data to our db for testing. I like SQL as well though we used only very basic SQL at my last two jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not really enjoying web development. I think designing and building APIs is cool but that&amp;#39;s about it. I also just don&amp;#39;t like coding in JS much. Also there seems to be this constant nudge for me to do more full-stack work at both jobs but I just don&amp;#39;t like working on front end or learning more about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone mentioned SRE to me but I don&amp;#39;t think I really like getting any closer to the ops side. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be as interested in the role besides the scripting part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; if context was too long:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to try to get back into data engineering, should I be targeting junior roles? I would say my Python is still decent, Spark almost completely forgot everything and I wasn&amp;#39;t that great with it to start with, same for Scala. SQL is a little rusty but better than most software engineers and worse than most data engineers. I&amp;#39;m pretty quick at picking up new tech and technologies as I&amp;#39;ve been having to do that basically every job. All in all I have about 3 years experience with almost half of it being data engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to try to transition back, what should I focus on learning/revisiting (is it mainly know Spark now?) and what should I keep an eye out for in terms of teams/roles?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ideal wishlist for a job:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fully remote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;120k+ base salary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;good mentorship and WLB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;primary language is Python, don&amp;#39;t mind using a little bit of others to get minor stuff done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;no on-call or at least healthy on-call setup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "yoh15o", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "adgjl12", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/yoh15o/going_back_into_data_engineering/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/yoh15o/going_back_into_data_engineering/", "subreddit_subscribers": 79182, "created_utc": 1667810533.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Hi.
