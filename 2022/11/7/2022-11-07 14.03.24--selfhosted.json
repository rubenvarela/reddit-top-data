I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really did&amp;#39;nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it&amp;#39;s own signature, with an android app to sync with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you guy know any webmail that could do that ? How do you guys handle multiple emails accounts without a desktop client ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time, any help or tips would be appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ynzca7", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Biidouille", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/ynzca7/looking_to_avoid_using_gmail/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ynzca7/looking_to_avoid_using_gmail/", "subreddit_subscribers": 208734, "created_utc": 1667761559.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "I have some services which I want to share with friends.\n\nHow to handle authentication?\n\nI would like to store the password only in one place, not in several places.\n\nI run an Ubuntu server.", "author_fullname": "t2_13dy25", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "how to handle authentication?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yogcyz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667807997.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have some services which I want to share with friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to handle authentication?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to store the password only in one place, not in several places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run an Ubuntu server.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yogcyz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "guettli", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/yogcyz/how_to_handle_authentication/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/yogcyz/how_to_handle_authentication/", "subreddit_subscribers": 208734, "created_utc": 1667807997.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "hi there.
