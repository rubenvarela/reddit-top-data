There are two databases which are on the same SQL server instance that references these databases but in their normal form without the _test after their name.\n\nMany of the stored procedures are fully qualified and they reference the specific databases on the server. There is about 50 of them. Instead of going into every single stored procedure manually and replacing Source with Source_Test manually you have been asked to implement dynamic solution.\n\nThe reason for this is because these stored procs are called by an SSIS package that holds parameters on a project level, so the variable's can be set in SQL Server using the environmental variables. At run time someone can enter the original database name and the name of whatever their test database is.\n\nSOLUTION :\nHere is what I did to fix this. Wrote a stored procedure in T-SQL that looks through every stored procedure on the server and replaces every mention of Source with Source_Test. It only look for information to the left of the first period in a fully qualified DB reference (which usually contains two periods) so it only looks at the database name. If the stored proc contains code that references Source they are all changed to Source_Test within the code of the stored procedure.\n\nThen I put this stored procedure at the top of a workflow in SSIS so it's the first thing the package commits. It uses the global variables in the SSIS project to hold the names of the input striking and output string for the search and replace proc.\n\nThen after the rename , all the processes in the SSIS package excute and then the same stored procedure is executed again, only with the input and output variables reversed. So everything goes back to normal.\n\n\nIve done this specific task in job titles completely different from the one I hold now. If you had this problem where would it go to ? Straight to Data Engineering ? Or would an analyst look at it first. Or Database Developer, DBA. The list goes on.

I was interested in filling these values, but was not sure what might be the best approach since the data was changing over time either in a positive or negative direction and thought that perhaps using methods that I had previously used for classification such as filling with median or mean would not produce accurate results. While examining the the data and looking for a possible solution to filling these values I remembered that by using Annual Growth Rate I could determine missing values by determining the rate of change between the given values then using the increase or decrease formula depending on the direction of the values given. Seeing as how I could not find this being done online I went ahead and attempted this in a Colab notebook and came up with the following proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still have some questions about the usability of this method, but believe it may be a feasible solution for filling missing values in a time series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://github.com/lifeofbaka/US-Energy-Timeseries/blob/main/US_Energy.ipynb", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UPyObv-tEwtHImTjwqNe5-FOCiBkJedMRmTfKMiJK1A.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e62d90faeb8e0ddafb25db873e1ce956735eca11", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UPyObv-tEwtHImTjwqNe5-FOCiBkJedMRmTfKMiJK1A.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2e828a2420f69cf30b6b2ac76032a7a3dd1c62a", "width": 108, "height": 54}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UPyObv-tEwtHImTjwqNe5-FOCiBkJedMRmTfKMiJK1A.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d33faa26bb4ec7e5a33a47c3cf2f337c7b5a01c", "width": 216, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UPyObv-tEwtHImTjwqNe5-FOCiBkJedMRmTfKMiJK1A.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4215d41a6a6a27a552c023ba602b9a02e348dae", "width": 320, "height": 160}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UPyObv-tEwtHImTjwqNe5-FOCiBkJedMRmTfKMiJK1A.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f558bed87a3edd11a005edd746a57474a8e93322", "width": 640, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UPyObv-tEwtHImTjwqNe5-FOCiBkJedMRmTfKMiJK1A.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=733b79d1d1eaf24da41797f6f6fc1d099ec3eafc", "width": 960, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UPyObv-tEwtHImTjwqNe5-FOCiBkJedMRmTfKMiJK1A.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d2c6429e737a40044a69003be89df8c19cd163d", "width": 1080, "height": 540}], "variants": {}, "id": "KQI7jHpzUxS9sbS-aD-2Uj8ZJIoGfbxzoUtFCi4BwA0"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4134b452-dc3b-11ec-a21a-0262096eec38", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ddbd37", "id": "z2bkys", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DarthKermit-65", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/z2bkys/using_aagr_to_determine_missing_values_in_a_time/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://github.com/lifeofbaka/US-Energy-Timeseries/blob/main/US_Energy.ipynb", "subreddit_subscribers": 80791, "created_utc": 1669167159.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Currently we are set up in BQ with a pseudo relational model that doesn't really fit any standard architectures.
