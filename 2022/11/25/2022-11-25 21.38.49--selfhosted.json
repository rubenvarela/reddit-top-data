While this is fine, it&amp;#39;s getting to the point where I&amp;#39;d like to consolidate backups and not run separate instances for each db. It would also be nice to be able to manage the backup schedules in one place and maybe even test the backups on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do yall have any suggestions for tools that do something like this, preferably that can be deployed via docker and run via web? I&amp;#39;ve tried searching for something like this on google, but have had no luck so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "z4eb28", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "williamwgant", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/z4eb28/suggestions_for_backup_tool_for_multiple_databases/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/z4eb28/suggestions_for_backup_tool_for_multiple_databases/", "subreddit_subscribers": 212027, "created_utc": 1669385450.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "Currently using Kavita but it doesn\u2019t have an iOS app\n\nWhat servers have an iOS App?\n\nI know Paperback supports Komga, but Komga only does image epubs and not text epubs (aka books), which is what I want", "author_fullname": "t2_nz9u1", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What selfhosted book server has an iOS app available for it?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "help", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_z3ukqf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Need Help", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1669323886.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently using Kavita but it doesn\u2019t have an iOS app&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What servers have an iOS App?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know Paperback supports Komga, but Komga only does image epubs and not text epubs (aka books), which is what I want&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "82508a80-05bc-11eb-ae09-0effb713859f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "z3ukqf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kvpop", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/z3ukqf/what_selfhosted_book_server_has_an_ios_app/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/z3ukqf/what_selfhosted_book_server_has_an_ios_app/", "subreddit_subscribers": 212027, "created_utc": 1669323886.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "I have Cloudflare tunnels setup on my Mac server.

To make this real short, I&amp;#39;m a noob when it comes to selfhosting and don&amp;#39;t really know how to do so. I tried a lot but didn&amp;#39;t find a way that works for bypassing my ISP&amp;#39;s firewall. And here I hope that you can help me out a bit :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My setup:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;local raspberry pi to serve as my local server&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;application backend written in flask (python)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;gunicorn web server &amp;amp; nginx reverse proxy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;domain + VPS from hostinger&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;set up raspberry to host website&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;set up VPS to redirect traffic from domain over VPS to my local server via VPN tunnel (to bypass ISP firewall)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to do that. I don&amp;#39;t expect a step by guide but a conceptual overview of what I should be doing in my case is much appreciated. I&amp;#39;m open to any solution as long as I can host from my local raspberry pi and can avoid the great ISP wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I can&amp;#39;t use Wireguard as an VPN provider.
