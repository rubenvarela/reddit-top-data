wondering if there's a universal opinion on becoming a generalist vs a specialist.\n\nTo give you some context, I have worked extensively on images and videos for 7+ years (a lot of deep learning) and a few months ago, I shifted to tabular data (fraud detection). Here are some of my observations.\n\n1. I enjoy solving problems in images, text, video and audio domains compared to anything else (Thanks to my background in signal and image processing). I am not very fond of other domains. \n\n2. I understand that solving a fraud problem is intellectually very challenging and the stakes are high. I also know that I'm going out of my comfort zone (which is a good thing) and exploring areas outside of computer vision.\n\n3. I'm facing the explore and exploit dilemma. I can exploit my experience in deep learning, specialize in it, and become a \"subject matter expert\" (whatever that means) in computer vision, audio data etc. This will involve going deep down the rabbit hole in these areas. \n\n4. There's the other option of becoming a jack of all trades, get good experience in other domains and work on projects outside my comfort zone. This may also involve obtaining a lot of domain and business knowledge.\n\nHowever, my career interests are within the computer vision domain. I'm ready to explore and grow within this field. I don't want to be a jack of all trades and work on every possible domain in data science.\n\nHaving said that, what are your opinions and thoughts on becoming a generalist and a specialist? What's more sustainable in the long run?
