What's insane is that these discs currently being sold are not M Discs at all, but regular organic layer Verbatim BD-Rs, yet Verbatim still calls these M Disc. When I tried calling them out on their lies by pointing out things such as the discs' MID being the same as that of regular BD-Rs and the discs having 6x burn speed despite real M Discs being 4x speed, they just chucked it up to \"the discs being completely reworked, and we moved production facility hence the new DISC IDs\". The most ridiculous part is, these \"new M Discs\" (as Verbatim support calls them) are writable in any standard Blu Ray drive, you don't even need a drive that supports M Disc burning! For those unaware, M Discs require an M Disc capable drive to be burned, because M Discs need a stronger laser than what is used for regular BDs. This stronger laser is only in M Disc drives and there is no way you could ever write a real M Disc in a non M Disc drive.

I currently have 2 HDDs connected to it, but at some point want to add a couple of SSDs and do some tiered caching to avoid accessing the HDDs unless absolutely necessary (to avoid the noise - HDD accessing noise really annoys me).\n\nAnyway, to my question: Every 5 seconds, regardless of whether the HDDs are being used, I hear them each being accessed (I hear two near-simultaneous \"accessing\" clicks, so am assuming it's one from each). Exactly every 5 seconds, without fail. In order to rule out TrueNAS as the source, I powered the VM off, and disconnected the LSI HBA from the VM. The \"accessing\" clicks persisted. I rebooted so that the HDDs would then show up in Proxmox - the \"accessing\" clicks still persisted.\n\nAny ideas how to stop this?\n\nThank you", "author_fullname": "t2_2wj2od18", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "LSI 9211-8i - HDDs Accessed Every 5 Seconds", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ytuoxa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668324031.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got an LSI 9211-8i (in IT Mode) that I pass through to a TrueNAS VM under Proxmox.

setups/questions, I thought I'd finally post it and get this community's thoughts. I have a QNAP NAS setup - a 4 bay TS-451+ with 3 10TB hdds in a RAID 5 setup. All told, I have around 11 terabytes of data used in the 18 TB pool. I'm looking to expand it a bit plus update those drives that are getting a couple years old. Within that pool, I have a Plex server with media files. Those backup weekly to a 14 TB external drive. My data doesn't update too often, so daily backups aren't a big priority. And if I lose a recent addition, it's not a huge problem. \n\nWith upcoming sales, I'm intending to rebuild things a bit. \n\n* SSD: 2 TB+ or whatever capacity I can get for a reasonable price for OS + Library\n* HDD: 16+ TB x 4 (2 in the main NAS, 2 in a secondary setup as a backup)\n\nI'm thinking of getting a SSD to run the OS on for performance reasons, and also to reduce the library's constant read/writes on the existing drives. But one of the biggest changes I am thinking about is moving from RAID 5 to not using RAID. At the size of my NAS setup, I don't think it adds any value. Here's some of the reasons I'm thinking\n\n* If one of the HDDs were to die in my current setup, then I'd be looking at a long rebuild time. With the trip to the computer store to find a drive included, this seems excessively stressful. \n* I have only 4 bays, so an SSD + 3 drive RAID 5 setup is possible. I have a 4 bay DAS as well, so i could even match it for backups. But it would be an additional 2 drives (4 to 6) and the rebuild would take even longer with larger drives. \n* If I go away from RAID, I could reduce activity on my drives by dividing tasks. For example, I could have one drive be for movies, and another for TV series. \n* If I wanted to expand my backups, I could just add more drives in offsite areas with much less cost than trying to build a matching offsite setup. \n\nAs for backup, I'd run weekly or daily backups like I do now to a connected matching drive connected via a USB DAS or a networked device. This would require dividing my files evenly across the drives, but I don't think that'd be much of a concern. I try to keep my collection to a minimum since removals are rare. This is a hobby of mine that helps my family have something fun to watch. So nothing here is a business or otherwise critical. Lots of nostalgia, though. \n\nIs there anything I've overlooked with this approach? Moving away from RAID seems strange when I have multiple drives at work. But with drive sizes, rebuild times, and transfer speeds as they are, I am not finding strong reasons to use RAID. I'd rather have a  backup drive I can just pop right back in and be up and running quickly. \n\nThank you for any thoughts!", "author_fullname": "t2_wu0dt", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Thinking of moving away from RAID for NAS setup", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yu4kvy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668352797.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had this question for a while, and not seeing similar setups/questions, I thought I&amp;#39;d finally post it and get this community&amp;#39;s thoughts.
