My initial understanding is that data analyst deal less with actual models tweaking or machine learning algorithms / concepts than data scientist. \nI have few precise doubts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will data analyst profile be substantially poor choice than data science profile? If yes why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard that a lot of non CS grads take up data analyst role. So is it something that CS post grad wont enjoy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How hard it is to transit to from data analyst to data scientist? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: It may help to answer above question if you understand what I enjoyed in the past. I enjoyed developing complex applications / systems in my SDE jobs. I also enjoyed algorithms, data structures and competitive programming. Currently I have developed interest in reinforcement learning and language models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yu3nkg", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SnooHabits4550", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/yu3nkg/what_role_should_a_computer_science_post_grad/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/yu3nkg/what_role_should_a_computer_science_post_grad/", "subreddit_subscribers": 819173, "created_utc": 1668350724.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I'm really new into this world and I guess this popular internet test maybe uses some kind of clustering algorithms with k-values and etc. But I can't understand how they weight every answer to specify the output(in mbti, the output would be your personality for example).\nThere are also some test that told you \"you are 60% x and 40% y.

The pay is great, I was already making 6-figures, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot by making it harder to get a DS job in the future since I don't have a data scientist / machine learning engineer title job.\n\nI had a recruiter tell me they look for having the data scientist title by name when choosing clients.\n\nThere are data scientists at the jobs I applied to and I figured I could work my way up to that title, but I'm not sure if I should.\n\nWhat has been your guys experience?", "author_fullname": "t2_bzw9ivz7", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How much do you care about title / how much did it matter being hired?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ytcpeh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668272771.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr would you take a lower title and a step back from pure data science as a junior due to a layoff, even if the pay was good?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was recently laid off.
