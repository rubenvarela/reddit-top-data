That means I am literally the only Data Analyst left on the team, with no backfill on the horizon. In addition, we had a complete data systems overhaul in May from our 40 year old mainframe system Old System to one I will just call New System. \n\nThese two events significantly shifted the scope of my responsibilities - now instead of me running and maintaining queries from Old System, I was charged not only to learn the design of New System, but also lead the data community at my institution for best practices and query \"recipes.\" In other words, I became \"the data expert\" overnight (because there was zero training for anyone and I happened to have a three months' advance period of playing with the test New System.)\n\nIn addition to playing the leadership role (presenting to large audiences, answering emails from a listserv to data users in the community,) I started facilitating connections with external offices, including our IT office that develops the intermediary data interface between New System and Native New System for our institution, and with our research office which handles regulatory reporting. There's been a lot of cruft work in simply organizing these meetings, taking notes, following up, and generally taking ownership of these new workstreams, given that my manager left, but I know that I'm actually digging deeper with these duties beyond what my previous manager did.\n\nSome of my bullet points of what I've been doing:\n\n* Handling a growing sector of ad hoc data requests\n   * More new requests from previous offices that have not requested data are coming in due to inexperience with New System. \n   * (There's a huge reliance on me to provide reports as even folks who are supposed to use the web user interface struggle and find my reports easier, like administrative people who aren't supposed to work with data at all, this is across like 15+ offices. Since this is just the volume of the work increasing, I don't really know if this would count for me in a raise/job description redux.)\n* Handling private and confidential data requests\n   * A lot of confidential, \"reputational risk\" data requests are coming to me now that the Senior Data Analyst is gone. Think requests from Legal.\n   * (Would this mean anything when trying to get a raise, and if so, what's the right language about it?)\n* Validating New System reports and queries against Native New System\n   * Investigate, write up Jiras, follow up with IT for critical upstream system issues that cause breaks downstream for staffs and students. Fix critical bug fixes\n   * (This was never in my job description and doesn't really fit a Data Analyst, is more Systems Analyst, yet has become 30% of my role since the migration. This is a beta testing, bug fixing job. In other words, if IT and our consultants did their jobs properly, I wouldn't be the one constantly finding bugs and delivering documentation on them.)\n* Growing sector of work in collaborating with IT, promoting data stewardship on campus\n   * As IT continues to come to this office and this data analyst as \"the\" data experts on campus, this office grows in leadership and visibility across offices.

That means I am literally the only Data Analyst left on the team, with no backfill on the horizon. In addition, we had a complete data systems overhaul in May from our 40 year old mainframe system Old System to one I will just call New System. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two events significantly shifted the scope of my responsibilities - now instead of me running and maintaining queries from Old System, I was charged not only to learn the design of New System, but also lead the data community at my institution for best practices and query &amp;quot;recipes.&amp;quot; In other words, I became &amp;quot;the data expert&amp;quot; overnight (because there was zero training for anyone and I happened to have a three months&amp;#39; advance period of playing with the test New System.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to playing the leadership role (presenting to large audiences, answering emails from a listserv to data users in the community,) I started facilitating connections with external offices, including our IT office that develops the intermediary data interface between New System and Native New System for our institution, and with our research office which handles regulatory reporting. There&amp;#39;s been a lot of cruft work in simply organizing these meetings, taking notes, following up, and generally taking ownership of these new workstreams, given that my manager left, but I know that I&amp;#39;m actually digging deeper with these duties beyond what my previous manager did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of my bullet points of what I&amp;#39;ve been doing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Handling a growing sector of ad hoc data requests\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More new requests from previous offices that have not requested data are coming in due to inexperience with New System. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(There&amp;#39;s a huge reliance on me to provide reports as even folks who are supposed to use the web user interface struggle and find my reports easier, like administrative people who aren&amp;#39;t supposed to work with data at all, this is across like 15+ offices. Since this is just the volume of the work increasing, I don&amp;#39;t really know if this would count for me in a raise/job description redux.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Handling private and confidential data requests\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A lot of confidential, &amp;quot;reputational risk&amp;quot; data requests are coming to me now that the Senior Data Analyst is gone. Think requests from Legal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(Would this mean anything when trying to get a raise, and if so, what&amp;#39;s the right language about it?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Validating New System reports and queries against Native New System\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investigate, write up Jiras, follow up with IT for critical upstream system issues that cause breaks downstream for staffs and students.
