The most ridiculous part is, these \"new M Discs\" (as Verbatim support calls them) are writable in any standard Blu Ray drive, you don't even need a drive that supports M Disc burning! For those unaware, M Discs require an M Disc capable drive to be burned, because M Discs need a stronger laser than what is used for regular BDs.

I rebooted so that the HDDs would then show up in Proxmox - the &amp;quot;accessing&amp;quot; clicks still persisted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas how to stop this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "ytuoxa", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NateroniPizza", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/ytuoxa/lsi_92118i_hdds_accessed_every_5_seconds/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ytuoxa/lsi_92118i_hdds_accessed_every_5_seconds/", "subreddit_subscribers": 653523, "created_utc": 1668324031.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_j2c74gm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Unraid Nas build -

Some research indicates that this might be an IBM feature, where the SED drive can be put into an \"auto-lock\" mode. [This page](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/psfa/7.2.1?topic=drives-unlocking-seds) mentions that you need IBM support to provide authorization to reformat the drives (even to just clear the data). \n\nOn most SATA drives that have internal drive encryption, I believe there's usually a way to force a secure erase even if you don't know the drive's lockout password. But it would appear that IBM is either using a proprietary setup (wouldn't surprise me, the drives probably have custom firmware) or SAS uses a completely different standard to begin with. \n\nRegardless, I tried just using hdparm, based on [this post](https://superuser.com/a/1299308/229062)'s instructions:\n\n```\ntestbox:/# hdparm --user-master m --security-set-pass mypassword /dev/sdf\nsecurity_password: \"mypassword\"\n\n/dev/sdf:\n Issuing SECURITY_SET_PASS command, password=\"mypassword\", user=master, mode=high\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\ntestbox:/# hdparm --security-erase mypassword /dev/sdf\nsecurity_password: \"mypassword\"\n\n/dev/sdf:\n Issuing SECURITY_SET_PASS command, password=\"mypassword\", user=user, mode=high\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\ntestbox:/# hdparm --security-erase-enhanced mypassword /dev/sdf\nsecurity_password: \"mypassword\"\n\n/dev/sdf:\n Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password=\"mypassword\", user=user\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n```\n\nSo, unless there's a secret trick to reformatting these drives, they're useless duds. \n\nJust a fair warning to those who like buying up old enterprise drives. It seems like it's getting more and more common to see weird shenanigans that prevent such drives from being reused, even in the scenario where the end user intends to reformat the drive and doesn't care about any data. My guess is it's companies wanting to satisfy the security demands and allay some of the fears companies have about data breaches (although the vast majority of breaches from large companies using drives like these don't come from physical hard drive theft, it comes from social engineering and network-based hacks...)", "author_fullname": "t2_udw4y", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Beware used IBM SAS hard drives (maybe?)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yulbpo", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668390015.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got a small lot of used 2TB IBM (rebadged Seagate) SAS hard drives.

Linux recognizes the drive, but it never &amp;quot;comes online&amp;quot; - i.e. it gets stuck on &amp;quot;Spinning up disk&amp;quot; until it times out and gives up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n[347779.336218] mpt2sas_cm0: mpt3sas_transport_port_remove: removed: sas_addr(0x5000c50085f13291)\n[347779.336222] mpt2sas_cm0: removing handle(0x000c), sas_addr(0x5000c50085f13291)\n[347779.336224] mpt2sas_cm0: enclosure logical id(0x500605b003ea4220), slot(7)\n[347801.814766] mpt2sas_cm0: handle(0xc) sas_address(0x5000c50085f13291) port_type(0x1)\n[347801.815919] scsi 6:0:5:0: Direct-Access     IBM-XIV  ST2000NM0043  A4 EC5C PQ: 0 ANSI: 6\n[347801.815923] scsi 6:0:5:0: SSP: handle(0x000c), sas_addr(0x5000c50085f13291), phy(7), device_name(0x5000c50085f13290)\n[347801.815925] scsi 6:0:5:0: enclosure logical id (0x500605b003ea4220), slot(7)\n[347801.815927] scsi 6:0:5:0: qdepth(254), tagged(1), scsi_level(7), cmd_que(1)\n[347801.815998] scsi 6:0:5:0: Power-on or device reset occurred\n[347801.816898]  end_device-6:5: add: handle(0x000c), sas_addr(0x5000c50085f13291)\n[347801.817149] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Spinning up disk...\n[347802.822432] ...................................................................................................not responding...\n[347902.128963] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Read Capacity(16) failed: Result: hostbyte=0x00 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK\n[347902.128973] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Sense Key : 0x2 [current]\n[347902.128979] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x0\n[347902.129329] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Read Capacity(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=0x00 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK\n[347902.129335] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Sense Key : 0x2 [current]\n[347902.129340] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x0\n[347902.130091] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] 0 512-byte logical blocks: (0 B/0 B)\n[347902.130096] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] 0-byte physical blocks\n[347902.130433] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Test WP failed, assume Write Enabled\n[347902.130530] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Asking for cache data failed\n[347902.130535] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Assuming drive cache: write through\n[347902.132374] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Spinning up disk...\n[347903.141819] ...................................................................................................not responding...\n[348002.448361] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Read Capacity(16) failed: Result: hostbyte=0x00 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK\n[348002.448373] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Sense Key : 0x2 [current]\n[348002.448379] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x0\n[348002.448819] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Read Capacity(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=0x00 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK\n[348002.448830] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Sense Key : 0x2 [current]\n[348002.448837] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x0\n[348002.450540] sd 6:0:5:0: [sdf] Attached SCSI disk\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The drive itself comes up but it appears as basically an empty removable drive, or a drive with 0 bytes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is behavior that I think would be expected if the drive were in a security mode where it requires a password before it appears to the system. Some research indicates that this might be an IBM feature, where the SED drive can be put into an &amp;quot;auto-lock&amp;quot; mode. &lt;a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/psfa/7.2.1?topic=drives-unlocking-seds\"&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; mentions that you need IBM support to provide authorization to reformat the drives (even to just clear the data). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On most SATA drives that have internal drive encryption, I believe there&amp;#39;s usually a way to force a secure erase even if you don&amp;#39;t know the drive&amp;#39;s lockout password. But it would appear that IBM is either using a proprietary setup (wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me, the drives probably have custom firmware) or SAS uses a completely different standard to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I tried just using hdparm, based on &lt;a href=\"https://superuser.com/a/1299308/229062\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s instructions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;```\ntestbox:/# hdparm --user-master m --security-set-pass mypassword /dev/sdf\nsecurity_password: &amp;quot;mypassword&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/dev/sdf:\n Issuing SECURITY_SET_PASS command, password=&amp;quot;mypassword&amp;quot;, user=master, mode=high\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\ntestbox:/# hdparm --security-erase mypassword /dev/sdf\nsecurity_password: &amp;quot;mypassword&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/dev/sdf:\n Issuing SECURITY_SET_PASS command, password=&amp;quot;mypassword&amp;quot;, user=user, mode=high\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\ntestbox:/# hdparm --security-erase-enhanced mypassword /dev/sdf\nsecurity_password: &amp;quot;mypassword&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/dev/sdf:\n Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password=&amp;quot;mypassword&amp;quot;, user=user\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n```&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, unless there&amp;#39;s a secret trick to reformatting these drives, they&amp;#39;re useless duds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a fair warning to those who like buying up old enterprise drives. It seems like it&amp;#39;s getting more and more common to see weird shenanigans that prevent such drives from being reused, even in the scenario where the end user intends to reformat the drive and doesn&amp;#39;t care about any data. My guess is it&amp;#39;s companies wanting to satisfy the security demands and allay some of the fears companies have about data breaches (although the vast majority of breaches from large companies using drives like these don&amp;#39;t come from physical hard drive theft, it comes from social engineering and network-based hacks...)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "20c598d2-b3f5-11ea-8f7a-0e7cd54fad9b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "yulbpo", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fmillion", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/yulbpo/beware_used_ibm_sas_hard_drives_maybe/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/yulbpo/beware_used_ibm_sas_hard_drives_maybe/", "subreddit_subscribers": 653523, "created_utc": 1668390015.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I actually was looking for a way to download rumble videos, not necessarily YouTube. \n\nI found a YouTube video showing how to download rumble videos ( [here](https://youtu.be/yHUBdjBX55k) ) and the guy used a website called davapps. \n\nI\u2019m asking Reddit if this site is legit because I\u2019m not a big tech guy and it seems almost too good to be true lol.

working against me.\n\nI have a large (12-drive) ZFS array that I use for my primary bulk storage. It's around 100TB or so of usable space.\n\nI have a task that runs monthly. It takes a snapshot of all datasets in the array and runs a scrub to check disk/array health. So far this has worked great. I've actually occasionally needed to dip into a snapshot to pull up a file. So it's good that I do this.\n\nHowever, there's two things that have occurred, one a \"goof\" of mine, the other being snapshots doing what they're supposed to but working against me.\n\nI had a friend who had a failing 18TB drive. I used ddrescue to clone the entire drive to a directory on my NAS (all but like two sectors were ultimately readable), and then also mounted the image as loopback and copied all the files off to my NAS. After my friend got a new drive, I copied the files back for him, and deleted them from my NAS. However, my screw-up was not creating a new dataset for this purpose, I just dumped it in a folder on my main dataset. Thus, the entire backup (around 12TB) got swept up in a snapshot, since the time between my friend giving me the bad drive and getting a replacement crossed the month boundary and my scheduled task ran. This was preventable - the right way would have been to make a new dataset, because then after I knew my friend was back up and running and I didn't need to hold the data I could just delete the dataset and all snapshots. But the upshot is I now have to discard last month's snapshot for the dataset - hopefully I don't end up needing it!\n\nThe second problem is more just ZFS doing the right thing, but me wishing it didn't. I was cleaning out folders and discovered that a huge (5TB) folder had somehow been duplicated at some point in the past - months ago. Thus it's still in *every month's snapshot* between when the duplication occurred and now. Since I don't think there's any way to selectively remove a folder from all snapshots while keeping the rest of the snapshot intact (that kinda would defeat the purpose in a way), I now have to either delete *every* snapshot for the dataset, or I have to deal with an extra 5TB or so of my drive being unusable. I know for *absolute certain* that I won't ever need those files again (since it literally was \"Folder\" and \"Folder - Copy\" - even rsync compares the two to be identical), but nonetheless that space will be held hostage in the snapshots until the last snapshot containing the dupe falls off the back end (my setup currently stores snapshots for 6 months, so that's 6 months of waiting for that 5TB to come back).\n\nAnd with my array now approaching &lt;1TB free, I'm starting to get a little nervous. I don't wanna just kill a ton of snapshots since they've been invaluable to me in the past, but I want that extra 5TB of space back... (I also want that 12TB of space from my friend's backup back, but that at least only means losing the most recent snapshot, not up to and including *all* snapshots!)\n\nI'm mostly writing just to vent/rant/comment, but the practical question is: is there actually a way to deal with this situation - i.e. remove a certain path from *all* snapshots without having to remove the entire snapshot? My assumption would be *no*, since that could possibly defeat the whole point of a snapshot. But nonetheless I'm faced with a decision - live with &lt;1TB free for the foreseeable future, or take the risk and delete all the snapshots (and maybe seriously regret it down the road)?\n\n(Normally I'd just add more drives, but my disk shelf is full, and I don't currently have the disposable income to buy another shelf and drives (insert irrelevant commentary about inflation/living expenses/etc. here)...)", "author_fullname": "t2_udw4y", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The unfortunate downsides to regular snapshots (by design)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/zfs", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yuidyg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668382116.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.zfs", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve finally found myself in one of those &amp;quot;not-so-edge&amp;quot; cases where my data preservation strategies are working against me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a large (12-drive) ZFS array that I use for my primary bulk storage.
