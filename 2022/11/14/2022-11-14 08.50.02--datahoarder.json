The most ridiculous part is, these \"new M Discs\" (as Verbatim support calls them) are writable in any standard Blu Ray drive, you don't even need a drive that supports M Disc burning! For those unaware, M Discs require an M Disc capable drive to be burned, because M Discs need a stronger laser than what is used for regular BDs.
