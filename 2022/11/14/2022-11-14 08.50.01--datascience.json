It took me about three months to learn GEE and develop a GEE program to calculate evapotranspiration from Landsat images based on a well-known approach described in scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently I am studying about the creation and training of neural network with tensorflow and I have already trained several models on some non-published data on my computer, with good results, but it is still not valuable for publishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will not provide links for my works because I want to stay anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to hear from you if my knowledge and skills are enough to try a job position in datascience. I finished my PhD this year, and even though I applied to hundreds of jobs, I have never been invited even for a job interview. I want to know what I am doing wrong and what skills I am lacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count":
