lots of papers, seen lots of tutorials online, GitHub projects, etc. but in every project they build the recommender in a simple way and evaluate it using a random user chosen by hand (better explanation: there is always a function that recommend a series of song (or movies, or articles, etc.) for a specific user and from this recommendation, by comparing the real listened songs by this user in the test set, the precision is computed).\n\n\n\nMY QUESTION:\nI'm new to the ML world and python programming, so I want some advices or some links to good projects on how to build a recommender system that creates recommendations for all users in the dataframe (not only for a specific one) to evaluate the overall precision (and other statistics).\nWhat are for example the steps

subset of the famous last.fm music dataset and I want to create a simple recommendation system (popularity-based and user-item collaborative filtering)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My pandas dataframe is something like this (obviously this is not the real data, just a simple example):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| user_id   |  title     |    listen_count |\n|   abcd     |    A       |            1            |\n|   abcd     |    F       |            25          |\n|   ghdf      |   J        |            6            |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all preprocessing and data exploration phase, I have a cleaned dataset with ~4390 unique users (which have listened at least 18 different songs and everyone have listened a single song minimum 6 times).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I have read lots of papers, seen lots of tutorials online, GitHub projects, etc. but in every project they build the recommender in a simple way and evaluate it using a random user chosen by hand (better explanation: there is always a function that recommend a series of song (or movies, or articles, etc.) for a specific user and from this recommendation, by comparing the real listened songs by this user in the test set, the precision is computed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MY QUESTION:\nI&amp;#39;m new to the ML world and python programming, so I want some advices or some links to good projects on how to build a recommender system that creates recommendations for all users in the dataframe (not only for a specific one) to evaluate the overall precision (and other statistics).\nWhat are for example the steps and the (computationally) fastest way to create a popularity-based and a user-item CF recommender like this I&amp;#39;ve just described above?\nPlease help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON
