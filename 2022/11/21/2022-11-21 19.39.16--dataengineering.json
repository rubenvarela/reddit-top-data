How it all began, what I've learnt, where I've failed, and where I am now.\n\nBefore I begin telling you about my journey, let me explain a bit about my background, ie: education and how I applied for this job post-covid. I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science in Data Science, and with that, it would have been natural for me to apply for a job as a Data Scientist. I applied for that position for around a month and sadly, did not get any response. This ofcourse mace me feel depressed and frustrated thinking that I would never be hired as a Data Scientist. Then, I decided to shift my strategy to another method, in which I approached a professional recruiter to assist me in finding a suitable company who would value learning and taking a chance with me. Thankfully, within a week, I got a response from a company which eventually became the workplace I am currently in.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the interview process. I was interviewed for a Data Scientist position, that consists of 3 seperate sessions. In the first session, I was given an assignment to solve \"The Birthday\" problem along with a probability problem (which I kind of forgot the actual name of it). To be completely honest, I had no idea what \"The Birthday\" problem even is, so I did what everyone who was given an interview assignment does and searched for it online. I then copied and pasted the code/solution for the assignment. It only took about 30 minutes to understand the code and prepare it for the second session. As the second session was about to get started, I bluntly told the interviewer that I just sort've cheated and pasted the online code/solution. Regardless, the interviewer brushed it off, and began another interview process. A few questions of the solution I copied were thrown at me, and I was able to answer a few of them with relative confidence. Though after this session, I immediately lost hope due to the factors in how I did the assignment and answered the questions, which again I remind you thar I literally copied and pasted the code to make it run. To my surprise, about a couple weeks later, I was asked to attend a third interview! I of course went in expecting some feedback on what I've done so far(maybe some \"DO NOT CHEAT!\" advice), but instead they congratulated me and told me I got the post. I was left shocked and confused but ultimately happy at this turn of events. \n\nFast forward to my first day in office, it was also during a Program Increment event, and I had no idea what anyone was doing. I kept hearing my manager go on about SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) and Scrum events. To be frank, I was so overloaded with information and was pretty shocked(scared more like) when my manager told me that I was to be split in half, figuratively of course, to be a member of both the Data and the Integration teams. This was due to the data team being new and small, only consisting of myself and my manager(whom by now I should mention, was the one who interviewed me). So during the first few days, I was trying to understand what the company is trying to acheive as well as my job scope within these two teams. I spent almost a month doing practically nothing and instead kept going around and bugging my colleages(specifically the Software Testing Lead, in my defense, they told me to ask him anything) to show me the ropes and understand what the system architecture is and so on and so on. \n\nIn the first few months in the company, I was temporarily assigned as a software tester in the Integration team and an analyst in the Data team.\u00a0 For the testing scope, most of the work is clear and easy to perform as it was just testing API callbacks, validating the documents' structure, and checking the acceptance of the API. I was a bit more relaxed in the Integration team but when it came to the Data side of things, I felt overwhelmed with stress and confusion from time to time. \n\nIn the data team, I was experimenting with a lot of stuff, such as analysing the company communication platform, coming up with word cloud and scraping information online. I spent most of my time cleaning the data and I felt it was pretty much wasted as it never reached production. While I was studyinh in University, the process of making an ML/AI model is straightforward, as the data has been cleaned and ready to use, but in real life, we need a data infrastructure which provides clean data for the downstream user to do analytics or ML/AI model training. That\u2019s when I began to learn about data engineering, this led to me realised that to create a fancy ML/AI, first we need to have a good dataset or else it will just be garbage in and garbage out. \n\nWith this newfound knowledge, I consulted with my manager and volunteered myself to explore the data engineering field and him being himself gave me the green light to do so. When I was exploring I discovered a lot of terms like data warehousing, data lake, ETL, ELT, reserver ETL and etc. I was so confused and overwhelmed by it so I searched how to start in DE(Data Engineering), and came to find that different people share different DE roadmaps with the similarities being the fundamentals, the usage of Python and SQL. At first, I never understood why we even need SQL in DE, so for the next few months, I kept following The Seattle Data Guys aka Ben Rogojan. I learn a lot of stuff from him such as explaining the different tools from the website.\n\nAfter a while, my company FINALLY appointed someone else as a Data Lead(this person is not the manager who interviewed me because he was busy being the Release Train Engineer for SAFe). This is good because most of the time I have no one else to consult to about data matters and I end-up YOLO-ing the job, leading to me messing up or it being so bad that it doesn\u2019t get the pushed to the production stage. At last, I finally have a team but it still only consists of two people hahaha. So then, we start performing proper work like researching ETL tools, data warehouse and data visualisation tools. \n\nI spent the following month trying out those ETL tools and Data Warehousing. I learnt a lot of stuff like the best practices, ETL vs ELT the use cases and so on. A website I'm fond of, [g2.com](https://g2.com), is a good place to compare different tools. I was tempted at first to try out a famous ETL tool, Fivetran. However,it isn't that beginner-friendly when compared to HevoData(which my company currently uses). That is way more user-friendly, where I can straight away query the data from HevoData without needing to query the data from the destination GUI, ie: AWS Redshift. I also learnt about DBT labs, which I still struggle with because I need to learn how to host them on GitHub and link it to the destination. \n\nSo, where did I fail? I failed in quite a few things such as understanding the use and importance of SQL, especially for the transformation part. I also made some mistakes such as I need to make a schema of raw data and a schema of transforming data in the data warehouse/ data lakehouse because I use the ELT method. I've also messed up by learning theorical concepts without an inkling of real-world use cases, as I'm afraid to try it out at first because in reality, depending on a companys' data maturity, there will have different ways to carry out building the data infrastructure. I still have other stuff to learn like database denormalisation, advanced SQL query, and etc. \n\nMy take is if you truly want to survive in the DE field, don\u2019t be afraid to fail, learn from the it and improve upon it. That\u2019s how I was able to build the companys' first data pipeline and Data warehouse/data lakehouse. I'm still way beyond from being expert let alone covering everything in this field but I will continue to keep on learning as I proceed.

In the first session, I was given an assignment to solve &amp;quot;The Birthday&amp;quot; problem along with a probability problem (which I kind of forgot the actual name of it). To be completely honest, I had no idea what &amp;quot;The Birthday&amp;quot; problem even is, so I did what everyone who was given an interview assignment does and searched for it online. I then copied and pasted the code/solution for the assignment. It only took about 30 minutes to understand the code and prepare it for the second session. As the second session was about to get started, I bluntly told the interviewer that I just sort&amp;#39;ve cheated and pasted the online code/solution. Regardless, the interviewer brushed it off, and began another interview process. A few questions of the solution I copied were thrown at me, and I was able to answer a few of them with relative confidence. Though after this session, I immediately lost hope due to the factors in how I did the assignment and answered the questions, which again I remind you thar I literally copied and pasted the code to make it run. To my surprise, about a couple weeks later, I was asked to attend a third interview! I of course went in expecting some feedback on what I&amp;#39;ve done so far(maybe some &amp;quot;DO NOT CHEAT!&amp;quot; advice), but instead they congratulated me and told me I got the post. I was left shocked and confused but ultimately happy at this turn of events. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to my first day in office, it was also during a Program Increment event, and I had no idea what anyone was doing. I kept hearing my manager go on about SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) and Scrum events. To be frank, I was so overloaded with information and was pretty shocked(scared more like) when my manager told me that I was to be split in half, figuratively of course, to be a member of both the Data and the Integration teams. This was due to the data team being new and small, only consisting of myself and my manager(whom by now I should mention, was the one who interviewed me). So during the first few days, I was trying to understand what the company is trying to acheive as well as my job scope within these two teams. I spent almost a month doing practically nothing and instead kept going around and bugging my colleages(specifically the Software Testing Lead, in my defense, they told me to ask him anything) to show me the ropes and understand what the system architecture is and so on and so on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first few months in the company, I was temporarily assigned as a software tester in the Integration team and an analyst in the Data team.\u00a0 For the testing scope, most of the work is clear and easy to perform as it was just testing API callbacks, validating the documents&amp;#39; structure, and checking the acceptance of the API. I was a bit more relaxed in the Integration team but when it came to the Data side of things, I felt overwhelmed with stress and confusion from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the data team, I was experimenting with a lot of stuff, such as analysing the company communication platform, coming up with word cloud and scraping information online. I spent most of my time cleaning the data and I felt it was pretty much wasted as it never reached production. While I was studyinh in University, the process of making an ML/AI model is straightforward, as the data has been cleaned and ready to use, but in real life, we need a data infrastructure which provides clean data for the downstream user to do analytics or ML/AI model training. That\u2019s when I began to learn about data engineering, this led to me realised that to create a fancy ML/AI, first we need to have a good dataset or else it will just be garbage in and garbage out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this newfound knowledge, I consulted with my manager and volunteered myself to explore the data engineering field and him being himself gave me the green light to do so. When I was exploring I discovered a lot of terms like data warehousing, data lake, ETL, ELT, reserver ETL and etc. I was so confused and overwhelmed by it so I searched how to start in DE(Data Engineering), and came to find that different people share different DE roadmaps with the similarities being the fundamentals, the usage of Python and SQL. At first, I never understood why we even need SQL in DE, so for the next few months, I kept following The Seattle Data Guys aka Ben Rogojan. I learn a lot of stuff from him such as explaining the different tools from the website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while, my company FINALLY appointed someone else as a Data Lead(this person is not the manager who interviewed me because he was busy being the Release Train Engineer for SAFe). This is good because most of the time I have no one else to consult to about data matters and I end-up YOLO-ing the job, leading to me messing up or it being so bad that it doesn\u2019t get the pushed to the production stage. At last, I finally have a team but it still only consists of two people hahaha. So then, we start performing proper work like researching ETL tools, data warehouse and data visualisation tools. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the following month trying out those ETL tools and Data Warehousing. I learnt a lot of stuff like the best practices, ETL vs ELT the use cases and so on. A website I&amp;#39;m fond of, &lt;a href=\"https://g2.com\"&gt;g2.com&lt;/a&gt;, is a good place to compare different tools. I was tempted at first to try out a famous ETL tool, Fivetran. However,it isn&amp;#39;t that beginner-friendly when compared to HevoData(which my company currently uses). That is way more user-friendly, where I can straight away query the data from HevoData without needing to query the data from the destination GUI, ie: AWS Redshift. I also learnt about DBT labs, which I still struggle with because I need to learn how to host them on GitHub and link it to the destination. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, where did I fail? I failed in quite a few things such as understanding the use and importance of SQL, especially for the transformation part. I also made some mistakes such as I need to make a schema of raw data and a schema of transforming data in the data warehouse/ data lakehouse because I use the ELT method. I&amp;#39;ve also messed up by learning theorical concepts without an inkling of real-world use cases, as I&amp;#39;m afraid to try it out at first because in reality, depending on a companys&amp;#39; data maturity, there will have different ways to carry out building the data infrastructure. I still have other stuff to learn like database denormalisation, advanced SQL query, and etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My take is if you truly want to survive in the DE field, don\u2019t be afraid to fail, learn from the it and improve upon it. That\u2019s how I was able to build the companys&amp;#39; first data pipeline and Data warehouse/data lakehouse. I&amp;#39;m still way beyond from being expert let alone covering everything in this field but I will continue to keep on learning as I proceed.
