Also, my understanding on git strategy and philosophy may be slightly limited so if you spot something stupid, please let me know! :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* Do you prefer monorepo or polyrepo for data analytics team?\n* If you have any personal experience, insights on this, please share yours with me \ud83e\udd79\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Background of this question**:\n\n*  Currently, we have multiple different teams (e.g., Decision science, Machine Learning, Forecasting aka my team and etc.) working on numerous data &amp; analytical modelling projects. And for the Python code management, we are using a single repository under the principle of \\`monorepo\\`. \n* On this single repository, there is **no git actions** (nor git hooks) in place. And I think my team (Not sure about other teams) would gain some benefits by enforcing some git actions (black formatting, pytest, and etc.). (The problem is, this single repo is owned by different team... so cannot implement the git actions at the moment.)\n* Fundamentally, I don't see the benefits of this \\`monorepo\\` concept at all. In this single repository, as different analytics teams use totally different modelling techniques and testings, each of the team doesn't actually use other team's code base and there is no point of sharing the code base in this case I guess? (\\*\\*\\*0.5% wrong as the only codes we share are shell scripts that submit ML jobs to GCP).\n* Also, this single repo design requires the coders to create their own libraries within the repository. So whenever you want to use the custom library that you developed, you actually have to `pip install ./your_library`  to use this library. The example of the repo structure follows:  \nsingle\\_repo/  \n\\--ml\\_job  \n\\----some\\_codes  \n... (bunch of code folders)  \n\\--lib  \n\\----team1\\_lib  \n\\----team2\\_lib  \n... (bunch of code folders)\n* Most importantly (IMO), our team's code base is related to **the monitored &amp; regulated statistical modelling** (Finance-related), hence, IMO, version control features like **git tag** and **release** would enhance the visibility of version control and code management for some of the stakeholders (Right now, this single repo does not allow any git tags as other teams)\n\n**My question:**\n\n* Are we using this monorepo concept totally inappropriately right now? \n* Is polyrepo concept that I am proposing right now making any sense?\n* What do you think? How does your organisation's code base look like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude4f Thanks a lot!

Since looking for correlations between features and statistical differences become too overwhelming and tedious, I thought of training a interpretable ML model and use it to discover which properties have the cell of each patient, There is no intention/value to make future predictions. The 2 best performing models were Logistic Regresion and a Random Forest with AOC &gt; 0.9 and F1-score &gt; 0.9 (trained with the whole dataset an 10-fold CV). Afterwards I use the SHAP-values and permutation feature importance to see which features and values intervals are more characteristic for each patient. Although there is a bit of discrepancy between the order of the most important features given by LogReg and RForest, there is good agreement for the most important features at each case.
