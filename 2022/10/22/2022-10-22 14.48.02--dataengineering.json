Some folks compare Snowflake with evil companies like Oracle and IBM.\n\nAs a big fan of Snowflake (I do not work for them and have no interest in promoting them) and someone who was very skeptical about Snowflake hype, I am very very very curious there this hate is coming from and it is biased towards other products and vendors (and we know quite a lot of people here promote vendors they work for).\n\nI would like to hear why you hate Snowflake so much and what product you love instead.\n\nHere a few reasons why I felt in love with Snowflake and why I do not hesitate to recommend it to my piers. I do have extensive background working with traditional RDBMS, EDW platforms and Big Data/Hadoop/Spark/Kafka and all the zoo.\n\nFirst off, Snowflake supports all 3 big cloud providers so you can move to another cloud and you cannot really do that with BigQuery or Redshift or Synapse. Yes, it is proprietary tech, and no, you cannot change their source code (but how often you have done it with other platforms??) but at least you are not locked on one cloud. A lot of companies who hire new CEOs/CTOs, love to start cloud migration projects and you never know which cloud you will end up using tomorrow.\n\nSecond, Snowflake does not keep your data hostage. They make it super easy to get data out of Snowflake. In fact, they help you do that by eating egress costs. You pay 0$ for outbound egress as long as you are moving data in the same region/cloud provider. Very easy to backup your snowflake tables to S3/Blob with literally one command and that command is very fast and efficient.\n\nThird, performance is amazing. A lot of time you get sub-second response time - Presto, Athena, Hive, Databricks, Spark etc. can only dream about such performance. ANSI SQL compatibility helps a lot to port queries from other data platforms. Amazing query plan that helps you tweak performance of queries (good luck understanding Databricks execution profile!)\n\nFourth, the stupid thing just works out of the box. No indexes, no clustering or partitioning, no primary keys. No special-type tables or special-type data types. Just load data and enjoy.\n\nFifth, while real-time is tough with Snowflake and it is more like 5-10 second near real-time, they had UPSERT capabilities and Snowpipe long before Databricks had delta lake. A lot of distributed systems still to date do not have DELETE or UPDATE capabilities.\n\nLast, but not least. People were building data lakes and data warehouses BOTH on Snowflake when data lakehouse (what a stupid term) was not coined by Databricks. It is very efficient as data lake because storage is dirt cheap and they support semi-structured data as well. With snowpark addition, this takes this to the next level but I am personally not sold on snowpark idea and I still love Spark. But if you look at what others do, they force you to build separate data lake and separate DW so you end up with two systems not one.\n\nYou get a host of countless other features that simple not possible in many other competing products. Dropped a table by accident and it was not on your daily backup? No problem, just run UNDROP TABLE command.\n\nWant to go back in time to query your table as it was 30 days ago? no worries, use time-travel and point-in-time query feature.\n\nWant to share your production environment data with non-production environment for development and testing? Just a few more commands to run and you get a virtual copy of your production databases in your non-prod snowflake account. You do not pay double price for storage since only metadata is shared.\n\nOh, and speaking of storage price - did you see how cheap it is?\n\nNow one popular complaint - but Snowflake is $$$. Correct, that is if you are lazy #$% who does not read documentation and does not use all the great features that Snowflake gives YOU to help you spend less money.  VDW auto-suspend, caching, instant resize of compute cluster, automated multi-clustering to deal with concurrency during peak time, materialized views (very limited IMHO because they do not support joins but new dynamic tables feature should solve this problem nicely).\n\nNow, it is not perfect by any means. I personally would love to see these features in future:\n\n1. ability to enforce primary keys natively\n2. simple visual UI to run, schedule and monitor SQL queries, with simple dependencies. Snowflake tasks are pretty bad and get really messy over time. I do not want to deal with external schedulers just to run simple Snowflake queries in sequence.\n3. security model is confusing and can get quite messy if you do not think it through from beginning. I am not sure what they were thinking here by not implementing simple RBAC model. But on a bright side, they give all everything you need to build your own custom model / roles.\n4. a lot of usability issues with UI though it is getting better. I mean common, no auto completion for SQL?? Fortunately, they have new UI Snowsight that has it but not all the features of the old UI are available there so depending on what you do you have to switch between old and new UI.\n\nBut as you can see these are pretty minor things.\n\nLet's go - tell me why you hate it and what do you think works better in this world.\n\nThanks!", "author_fullname": "t2_5a55k9k4", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Question to Snowflake haters", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ya587h", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1666389949.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666387554.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few posts and comments recently about Snowflake.

Main programming language is Python (Libraries commonly used are Pandas, numpy, selenium,openpyxl, simple_salesforce and a few select api to access data stored on third party provisioned services), SQL, Salesforce queries, Power Query for Power BI manipulation. \n\nRecently I have been integrating a lot more Azure services into our workflow, the goal around this is to reduce the dependence of the team on excel and the need to constantly pull large amounts of the same data from the db during pipeline runs. The main services I have included are Azure Storage (blobs), Azure functions, Key Valult and Azure Api management.\n\nI have two certifications: Azure Data Engineer (Dp203) and Azure Adminstrator (Az104). Also prepping for Azure Devops Cert (Az 400).\n\nMy current title is Data Analyst, however I feel like it does not really capture all the things that I do.

I think it\u2019s worth mentioning more of my background that seems to align with the Ontology Specialist role. Before pursuing software engineering, I got an undergrad in Linguistics and took many Philosophy courses while in college. As a part of the bootcamp, I built two full-stack capstone projects that incorporated NLP with Python\u2019s NLTK library to extract Sentiment Analysis data and insights from news stories and artist lyrics.

Is this a valid fear? And a few more questions:\n\n1.
