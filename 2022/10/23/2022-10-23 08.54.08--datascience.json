And for the Python code management, we are using a single repository under the principle of \\`monorepo\\`.\n* On this single repository, there is **no git actions** (nor git hooks) in place. And I think my team (Not sure about other teams) would gain some benefits by enforcing some git actions (black formatting, pytest, and etc.). (The problem is, this single repo is owned by different team... so cannot implement the git actions at the moment.)\n* Fundamentally, I don't see the benefits of this \\`monorepo\\` concept at all. In this single repository, as different analytics teams use totally different modelling techniques and testings, each of the team doesn't actually use other team's code base and there is no point of sharing the code base in this case I guess? (\\*\\*\\*0.5% wrong as a couple of codes are shared for final modelling process).\n* Also, this single repo design requires the coders to create their own libraries within the repository. So whenever you want to use the custom library that you developed, you actually have to `pip install ./your_library`  to use this library.\n* Most importantly (IMO), our team's code base is related to **the monitored &amp; regulated statistical modelling** (Finance-related), hence, IMO, version control features like **git tag** and **release** would enhance the visibility of version control and code management for some of the stakeholders (Right now, this single repo does not allow any git tags as other teams)\n\n**My question:**\n\n* Are we using this monorepo concept totally inappropriately right now?\n* Is polyrepo concept that I am proposing right now making any sense?\n* What do you think? How does your organisation's code base look like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude4f Thanks a lot!

In this single repository, as different analytics teams use totally different modelling techniques and testings, each of the team doesn&amp;#39;t actually use other team&amp;#39;s code base and there is no point of sharing the code base in this case I guess? (***0.5% wrong as a couple of codes are shared for final modelling process).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also, this single repo design requires the coders to create their own libraries within the repository. So whenever you want to use the custom library that you developed, you actually have to &lt;code&gt;pip install ./your_library&lt;/code&gt;  to use this library.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Most importantly (IMO), our team&amp;#39;s code base is related to &lt;strong&gt;the monitored &amp;amp; regulated statistical modelling&lt;/strong&gt; (Finance-related), hence, IMO, version control features like &lt;strong&gt;git tag&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;release&lt;/strong&gt; would enhance the visibility of version control and code management for some of the stakeholders (Right now, this single repo does not allow any git tags as other teams)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are we using this monorepo concept totally inappropriately right now?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is polyrepo concept that I am proposing right now making any sense?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What do you think? How does your organisation&amp;#39;s code base look like?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\ud83d\ude4f Thanks a lot!
