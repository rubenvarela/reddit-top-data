In this post, I would like to explain my process of archiving the footage from tape to files on my NAS. While capturing the video from the camera to my PC was relatively easy, I had to invest a bit of time searching here on reddit and other places on how to process it efficiently and with minimal quality loss. Hopefully, others find this helpful, avoid problems and mistakes that I made and also discover new techniques like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A bit of background:** Although miniDV is digital, it is stored in an interlaced format, opposed to the progressive format which is used for almost everything nowadays. When playing interlaced video on a normal monitor, you will experience a combing effect on moving objects. That is why we have to deinterlace interlaced video to watch it in its full glory. But more on that later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Capturing the miniDV tapes to the PC:** for this I used my parents' Sony miniDV camcorder, which I plugged into the PC via Firewire. I used a Firewire PCI card like [this](https://amzn.eu/d/iJLVyfq) I had lying around, although you can use any PCIe or USB adaptor. The advantage of using Firewire is that the video gets transferred losslessly and even includes the dates the footage was shot!\n\nThe software I used for this part is called [WinDV](http://windv.mourek.cz/). Here, I just had to specify a video source (my camcorder), a destination file and hit capture. WinDV automatically saves one video file in .avi format for each scene that is on the tape and names it with the date when it was shot. So if your camcorder's date settings were correct when you shot the video, you have a very easy way of sorting the files by date and time.\n\nIn my case I captured 893 files from 13 or so miniDV cassettes which were shot between 2002 and 2012. The files that WinDV produces are very big, all together it was 192 GB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Post-processing:** You could just leave the files as they are, in their interlaced format. Which is exactly what I did for one or two years until my parents recently got a new TV that couldn't read the .avi format. There are four goals when post-processing the avi files:\n\n1. adding the dates of the videos as subtitles so they can be seen when watching the video\n2. converting them into the .mkv format that most devices understand and can play\n3. reducing the video file size\n4. deinterlacing the video\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1:** The software [DVdate](https://paulglagla.com/en/dvdate-2/) can be used to create subtitle files for each video that contain the date and time of when the video was shot. The software's website explains how DVdate can be used to\n\n&gt;create a .srt subtitle file containing the overlay: instead of permanently embedding the datecode, you can automatically create a .srt file containing the same information as subtitles, and then activate them when you read the video in most media players.\n\nI configured it so that the date and time get displayed for 10 seconds at the beginning of each video file.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2-4:** I use [StaxRip](https://github.com/staxrip/staxrip) to encode the video because it includes the QTGMC deinterlacer, which is from my research a very good deinterlacer that produces less artifacts in the video than other deinterlacers like the one included in [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr).\n\n[Here is a screenshot of the settings that I used in StaxRip.](https://imgur.com/a/C31dMSG) The source video in the picture is in PAL format, but I also encoded videos from an older camera that were in NTSC and had a different color format 4:1:1 instead of 4:2:0. This caused an error with the source filter FFVideoSource. After I changed it to DirectShowSource by right-clicking the Source row under \"AVS Filters\", StaxRip could also convert those files. I used the \"file batch\" option to convert a whole folder with all video files. Although the x265 (HEVC) codec is newer and more efficient than x264 (AVC), it is optimized for HD and 4K UHD content and not so much for SD like miniDV video. In my tests the x265 encoded files were a bit larger in size, so I stuck with x264. Under \"AVS Filters\" you can also see \"Prefetch\", this is added to tell the QTGMC to use all threads of the CPU ([see this thread](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/399820-StaxRip-low-CPU-usage)).\n\nThe subtitles, which are inside the .srt file we created earlier, are automatically embedded into the new file by StaxRip. I wanted them to be selected as the default option when the player plays the video so that I didn't need to go into the settings and turn on subtitles for each video. This can be done with the software [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/). In its default state, MKVToolNix cannot apply the same settings to multiple video files at once, but thanks to a guy from GitHub, we have a [workaround](https://github.com/Serede/mkvtoolnix-batch) for that! Another plus of using MKVToolNix is that it fixes a fault in StaxRip's encoder that causes it not to display video information like the framerate in programs like VLC (when you press CTRL+J). After MKVToolNix has remuxed the video, the information is shown correctly again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's all that's to it!\n\nAfter post-processing, all video files now have a size of 22.7 GB which is only roughly 12 % of the size of the captured .avi files. I can't see any loss in quality over the originals aside from deinterlacing. And they play flawlessly on my parents' new TV!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Great Success!](https://youtu.be/r13riaRKGo0)", "author_fullname": "t2_1bw4332m", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How I archive miniDV tapes - a short guide", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "guide", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yblzv9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Guide/How-to", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 66, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1666566425.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666542332.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family recorded many videos of me and my brother throughout our childhood on miniDV.

Or do I really just lose it?\n\nThanks!", "author_fullname": "t2_4id0x6ry", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Using Left Over Space In ZFS", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yba3gi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666506198.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the process of recreating my home server because I ran out of space.
