This is fast degenerating into additionism/retentionism vs removalism which had happened perennially in this site as a whole, which to the best of my understanding has contributed to low editorial retention. From time to time absolutist rationales and stances to justify deletion/noninclusion of contents and even whole pages, which had sometimes contributed to Systemic bias; one of the long string of latest examples being Donna Strickland. It's easy to just sit down at couch and say \"I don't know anything of that or that or that, let's delete it!\" about local people, politics, economics, religion, events, science, arts, literature, film, theater, food and drinking/restaurants, geography, astronomy, dance, music, sports, education and whatever all around the globe\". It's also easy to remove \"unimportant or irrelevant\" information because of lack of familiarity or disinterest due to cultural differences. While you here might want a simplistic presentation, others like readers might want Wikipedia to be detailed and be like a Wiki rabbit hole.\nTo the best of my understanding, the German Wikipedia underwent similar craze and as a result lost financial donors and contributors due to \"purging trolls\" activity. Because of that their publications has regularly linked to English Wiki instead of their native version. Note that I'm not advocating for an radically unrestricted of anything into this encyclopedia because some may violate copyright laws or otherwise misinformation, but it's no good either if you take the other side to the extreme.\nWith the help of this word counter which I copied and pasted the text from the original version (before *name censored* removal), the word count stands at 1,321 words (including the section titles). This is far short of 6,000 to 10,000 words described in WP:SIZESPLIT which takes between 30 and 40 minutes to read at average speed.\n&gt;  In the end additionism/retentionism vs removalism is a zero sum game which not playing would be wise. One possible middle ground is to use only reliable sources with Taiwan News, VICE and Heise as a minimum in terms of reputation and/or reliability, and move on after that.\n\nAn editor who wants removal:\n\n&gt; I agree with (name censored) The article is in a pretty bad state, with a rather large amount of unencyclopaedic and crufty content that should be removed. Unfortunately, with the IP editor's preference for long paragraphs that say very little ([274]), repeated baiting attempts directed at me ([275], [276], [277]), and their recent restoration of content crufty material because it \"disrupted the story flow\" ([278]), I am not alone in being extremely hesitant to try and make any improvements to the article at present. I fear that without some sort of intervention, frustration will drive otherwise productive and good faith editors away from the article in the form of \"Let the Wookiee win\"\n\nAnother:\n\n&gt; Hi, the editor whose edits were challenged here. Wanted to point out that when the discussion about my edits was started, the IP editor mentioned but didnt tag me. When another put a notice on my talk page to tell me about the discussion, the IP editor removed it. diff 1, diff 2\n&gt;  Also wanna mention that the Taiwan News RfC was never closed, but by my count the survey had 7 votes for \"Generally reliable\", 9 votes for \"Marginally reliable or unclear\", and 1 vote for \"Generally unreliable and too partisan for factual reporting\". I didnt know about the RfC when I challenged the source, just that it wasnt WP:RSP, but the IP editor has been saying the RfC decided Taiwan News is \"quite reliable\" and I dunno where that came from.\n&gt;  For my edits, I did it in three parts because they needed three different edit summaries and because I wanted to wait and look at the article more before removing the biggest chunk. I havent edited the page since my edits were challenged.\n\nIP editor (again): \n\n&gt; (name censored) had by now told me and others to go to a multitude of other wikis catering for intricate/narrative style of presentation. There's a huge problem with the notion; speaking from reader's perspectives, if you want to learn about a subject you don't know or otherwise obscure to you, would you prefer them to be presented at one stop in a trusted encyclopedia rather than going site-by-site? Because here's one thing; by hopping through different sites there's also a security risk because presently browser exploits like remote code execution are all too prevalent and even \"legitimate source sites\" can one day fall victim to such attack. As an example Over 47,000 Malicious WordPress Plugins Are Active on Nearly 25,000 Websites. Scan it with Malwarebytes, Virustotal or anything you can, but most of the time they don't catch zero-day attacks until it's late. Almost all the policies that we cite here are formed during the 00s or 10s, when these aren't so prevalent. English Wikipedia ultimately is among the top sites visited on the Internet and it looks so much like putting too many eggs in one place since the shutdown of Google Knol.\n\n\n&gt;  After all, it's going straight into the dead end per the Poe's law if we harangue on what constitutes \"improvement\" or \"unencyclopaedic\", so as (name censored) claimed the problems now involve conduct issues here are a couple of questions for her, although (name censored) can answer as well:\n\n\n&gt;  If you can remember, what caused you to come to the article for the first time? It'd be helpful if you describe your feelings back then.\nMost importantly, you insisted on wanting to work on and improve the article, so what was your end goal? Let's do a thought experiment where suddenly you are the only active editor in Wikipedia while on that page. Imagine that Thanos had been resurrected and snaps everyone except you. More realistically, the sham referendums at occupied areas in Ukraine went through and Putin uses it as a justification (\"threatening Russia's territorial integrity\") to fire a tactical nuke at the Black Sea. Maybe Putin's crazier than we thought and sent the kiloton against Ivano-Frankivsk, Izmail, Lozova, Irshava Berdiansk, Tokmak, you name it. Instead of cowing the world NATO intervenes and destroy Russian positions throughout occupied areas resulting in a formal declaration of war by RU. A malfunctioning early warning radar falsely reported incoming missiles but there's no Stanislav Petrov this time. San Francisco is hit with a Bulava MIRV, as does New York City, Washington DC, London, Belfast, Edinburgh, Manchester, Moscow, St Petersburg, Vladivostok, Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and so many other cities, knocking off the Internet for good. You survived, hiding in a bunker or something. It turns out that you have a complete dump in a hard drive and deciding to edit that a bit to present to leftover future generations. What would that be for this page? To answer the question, put the page source in personal sandbox or rather WP:SANDBOX, edit it as if you're the only one doing that, and put the sandbox diff link of your finished work back here. For reference, this is my answer.\n\nPasserby:\n\n&gt;  Around 7,000 words of discussion or 18 pages in a letter-sized document with Arial font 11. Wow. I am fascinated by this talk page treatises. I am sure there are editors who would gladly analyze this discussion to determine a summary and render a resolution. But most editors would walk away in an instant though. I have to mention that you guys still are midway of reaching the 14,000 level of an epic by (name censored). Cheers!\n\nim14andthisisdeep:\n\n&gt; Ultimately the best of both worlds would be forking. I think that Meta-Wiki had said somewhere that alternative namespaces could serve fit for the purpose; even though Simple English Wikipedia, which is so ideal for reductionists/minimalists, is so underutilized. \n\n&gt; Most of the time y'all will take an inch for a mile, while the clash of synergistic currents continues unabated. Seen it a hundred times. Here's a two cent prognosis. Take an example. (name censored) took reductionism/minimalism to the extreme like it's like Icarus going to the sun, so much that they finally had enough of him. He has the template on his page that \"he reserves the right to screw up\", but that doesn't do much. More recent would be the (name censored) controversy; not really addition/reductionism related, but ya'll came very close to imploding. It's a miracle that most of the world were too enmeshed of the protests in Hong Kong; otherwise there'd be a few, if not hundreds, of forks now, rather than a monolith monopoly took for granted, or so many eggs in a basket. Tides are forever, but sandcastles aren't.\n\n\nNow they're itching to remove it.\n\n&gt; I was actually just looking at that. I think that because of the 2016 Motherboard article, 2018 BBC news piece, and the 2020 IranWire interview we just barely squeak over the GNG line. But it's super marginal, and I could also see an AfD deleting the article anyway.\n\nAfD stands for [Articles for Deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion).

English Wikipedia ultimately is among the top sites visited on the Internet and it looks so much like putting too many eggs in one place since the shutdown of Google Knol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, it&amp;#39;s going straight into the dead end per the Poe&amp;#39;s law if we harangue on what constitutes &amp;quot;improvement&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unencyclopaedic&amp;quot;, so as (name censored) claimed the problems now involve conduct issues here are a couple of questions for her, although (name censored) can answer as well:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can remember, what caused you to come to the article for the first time? It&amp;#39;d be helpful if you describe your feelings back then.\nMost importantly, you insisted on wanting to work on and improve the article, so what was your end goal? Let&amp;#39;s do a thought experiment where suddenly you are the only active editor in Wikipedia while on that page. Imagine that Thanos had been resurrected and snaps everyone except you. More realistically, the sham referendums at occupied areas in Ukraine went through and Putin uses it as a justification (&amp;quot;threatening Russia&amp;#39;s territorial integrity&amp;quot;) to fire a tactical nuke at the Black Sea. Maybe Putin&amp;#39;s crazier than we thought and sent the kiloton against Ivano-Frankivsk, Izmail, Lozova, Irshava Berdiansk, Tokmak, you name it. Instead of cowing the world NATO intervenes and destroy Russian positions throughout occupied areas resulting in a formal declaration of war by RU. A malfunctioning early warning radar falsely reported incoming missiles but there&amp;#39;s no Stanislav Petrov this time. San Francisco is hit with a Bulava MIRV, as does New York City, Washington DC, London, Belfast, Edinburgh, Manchester, Moscow, St Petersburg, Vladivostok, Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and so many other cities, knocking off the Internet for good. You survived, hiding in a bunker or something. It turns out that you have a complete dump in a hard drive and deciding to edit that a bit to present to leftover future generations. What would that be for this page? To answer the question, put the page source in personal sandbox or rather WP:SANDBOX, edit it as if you&amp;#39;re the only one doing that, and put the sandbox diff link of your finished work back here. For reference, this is my answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passerby:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Around 7,000 words of discussion or 18 pages in a letter-sized document with Arial font 11. Wow. I am fascinated by this talk page treatises. I am sure there are editors who would gladly analyze this discussion to determine a summary and render a resolution. But most editors would walk away in an instant though. I have to mention that you guys still are midway of reaching the 14,000 level of an epic by (name censored). Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;im14andthisisdeep:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the best of both worlds would be forking. I think that Meta-Wiki had said somewhere that alternative namespaces could serve fit for the purpose; even though Simple English Wikipedia, which is so ideal for reductionists/minimalists, is so underutilized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time y&amp;#39;all will take an inch for a mile, while the clash of synergistic currents continues unabated. Seen it a hundred times. Here&amp;#39;s a two cent prognosis. Take an example. (name censored) took reductionism/minimalism to the extreme like it&amp;#39;s like Icarus going to the sun, so much that they finally had enough of him. He has the template on his page that &amp;quot;he reserves the right to screw up&amp;quot;, but that doesn&amp;#39;t do much. More recent would be the (name censored) controversy; not really addition/reductionism related, but ya&amp;#39;ll came very close to imploding. It&amp;#39;s a miracle that most of the world were too enmeshed of the protests in Hong Kong; otherwise there&amp;#39;d be a few, if not hundreds, of forks now, rather than a monolith monopoly took for granted, or so many eggs in a basket. Tides are forever, but sandcastles aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now they&amp;#39;re itching to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was actually just looking at that. I think that because of the 2016 Motherboard article, 2018 BBC news piece, and the 2020 IranWire interview we just barely squeak over the GNG line. But it&amp;#39;s super marginal, and I could also see an AfD deleting the article anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AfD stands for &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\"&gt;Articles for Deletion&lt;/a&gt;.
