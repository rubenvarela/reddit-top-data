So I'm baselining and looking for outliers, which should have a high correlation with 'bad' in my dataset.

It seems like an interesting question, since as analysts we don&amp;#39;t know everything and if we try to select feature manually, there&amp;#39;s a good chance we might miss something. Right? There might be some combination of features which, when correlated with some combination of other features ends up being a good indicator that we wouldn&amp;#39;t have manually expected. Maybe 3 features plotted on a 3D chart with K-Means clustering or just human viewing reveals something interesting / creates a valuable signal that we might not have guessed or tested if we were hand-picking the features we thought might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m computing an exhaustive list of features globally and locally, like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How standard / deviant is the feature locally?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;local occurence count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;local occurence as % of total local feature count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How standard / deviant is the feature globally?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;global occurence count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;global occurence count as % of global feature count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is the feature related to other features locally?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: min distance, where distance is in terms of index&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: max distance, where distance is in terms of index&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: avg distance, where distance is in terms of index&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: min distance, where distance is in terms of character count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: max distance, where distance is in terms of character count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: avg distance, where distance is in terms of character count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How globally standard / deviant is the feature&amp;#39;s relationships to other features locally?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: min distance as % of all global min distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: max distance as % of all global max distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: avg distance as % of all global avg distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: min distance as % of all global min distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of character count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: max distance as % of all global max distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of character count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for each term: for each other term: avg distance as % of all global avg distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of character count&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the theory I&amp;#39;m experimenting with, planning to just produce every possible chart, perhaps thousands, and then do some simple clustering on all of them and see if features associated with known-bad sample have a statistical tendency to end up in distinct clusters in any of those plots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I potentially on the right track? Is this a known strategy in data science? It&amp;#39;s my first real run-in with cleaning data, isolating / computing features, so I&amp;#39;m still really just shooting in the dark at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "y6txbs", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jonathan-Todd", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/y6txbs/is_it_sometimes_a_good_strategy_to_identify_prep/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/y6txbs/is_it_sometimes_a_good_strategy_to_identify_prep/", "subreddit_subscribers": 814105, "created_utc": 1666059259.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Basically the title, and will it be easy to apply the material on python instead?", "author_fullname": "t2_lus61uk", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Is Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course still a good choice?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "education", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_y6yd0l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Education", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666072408.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically the title, and will it be easy to apply the material on python instead?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "99f9652a-d780-11e7-b558-0e52cdd59ace", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "y6yd0l", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mohamedk97", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/y6yd0l/is_andrew_ng_machine_learning_course_still_a_good/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/y6yd0l/is_andrew_ng_machine_learning_course_still_a_good/", "subreddit_subscribers": 814105, "created_utc": 1666072408.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi, I'm relatively new to time-series modeling and am not quite sure how to approach this problem.
