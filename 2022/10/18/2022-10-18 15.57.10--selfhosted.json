Despite that I've been self hosting for a couple years and just got Nextcloud setup yesterday. Oh boy do I feel like I've been missing out.\n\nI knew it was used for file sharing but I had no idea how much it does, so in case there are any other people like me that missed the memo on everything Nextcloud offers here's what I've discovered and in the last 24 hours:\n\n1. File sharing. This is obvious but I want to emphasize how seamless this is. Nextcloud provides an interface similar to google drive or one drive for managing, uploading, and sharing files, and it works perfectly. It makes managing user permissions easy and finally gives me a way to share a link to files on my server. No need to try and get people to make user accounts, you can just send a link that opens to the files you want to share with a single link.\n2. Office. Nextcloud offers full office functionality for free, just like what you get with google drive but without all the pesky google getting in the way. I had no idea this was integrated and it is super convenient. But it gets better...\n3. Collaboration. One of the coolest things about google drive, at least when it was new because I still remember its launch, was the ability to collaborate in real time on a document. Nextcloud has the same capability in a completely self hosted package. And I can't emphasize this point enough, people don't need accounts. I wouldn't leave files unprotected for long, but for a short time you can share a link to a file and give everyone permission to edit the file. No accounts needed.\n4. Talk. In the past I have used rocket chat for a completely private chat server but next cloud talk is better. I love that it finally gives me an option for a self hosted video chat and phone chat system that's integrated into the normal text chat.\n5. Email and calendar. I have way too many email accounts that I have to check regularly, there are existing clients that let me bring everything into 1 place but many are local only. Nextcloud's lets me pull all my emails and calendars into a single place that can be accessed from anywhere.\n6. Customization. I run my own small business I can't tell you how cool it is to send a link to clients and instead of going to onedrive or google drive they go to a subdomain of my website and its fully branded. The background color even matches the rest of my site.\n7. Mobile backup. Basically says it all, photos can be backed up with the mobile app in real time. This is great!\n\nI think that covers it. I have no affiliation with nextcloud and I'm not an expert on it.

I&amp;#39;ve decided to try out Nextcloud, and to make it available externally, but I&amp;#39;m having nothing but trouble getting the certificates created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nextcloud is running with Linuxserver&amp;#39;s docker container (I also tried the official one, and ran into similar issues), with the following docker compose setup:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;\nservices:\n  nextcloud:\n    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest\n    container_name: nextcloud\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - PUID=1000\n      - PGID=1000\n      - TZ=America/Chicago\n    volumes:\n      - ./config:/config\n      - ./data:/data\n    ports:\n      - 8080:443\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been able to verify it works correctly when accessing it from my local network. I created a new subdomain as I have done before, pointed it to the correct place, but NPM/Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt will not make a valid certificate for it. Some settings:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Domain name: nextcloud.mydomain.tld\nScheme: https (I also tried http)\nForward IP: My server&amp;#39;s IP, as I use for other services\nForward Port: 8080\nCache Assets - No\nBlock Common Exploits - Yes\nWebsockets Support - Yes\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When creating a new SSL certificate:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Force SSL\n- HTTP/2 Support\n- HSTS Enabled\n- HSTS Subdomains\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these are what I typically use. Creating the certificate fails simply with &lt;code&gt;Some challenges have failed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one difference is that most things I have set up use port 80 or both 80/443. This is the first time I&amp;#39;ve set up a service that uses 443 by default, and I&amp;#39;m unsure if that would cause some change required. Other than that, I&amp;#39;m completely out of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7b9b9156-5ccb-11eb-9ab6-0e4839ba7cc3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "y6jom4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sigma-Alpha_2", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/y6jom4/struggling_to_get_nextcloud_nginx_proxy_manager/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/y6jom4/struggling_to_get_nextcloud_nginx_proxy_manager/", "subreddit_subscribers": 205448, "created_utc": 1666033809.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Would it be useful to use Dynamically updated Whitelist ?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_y79ck5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_8y3qa8t1", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "default", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "crosspost_parent_list": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "sysadmin", "selftext": "Open ports to the public give me chills.
