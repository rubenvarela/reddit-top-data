Despite that I've been self hosting for a couple years and just got Nextcloud setup yesterday. Oh boy do I feel like I've been missing out.\n\nI knew it was used for file sharing but I had no idea how much it does, so in case there are any other people like me that missed the memo on everything Nextcloud offers here's what I've discovered and in the last 24 hours:\n\n1. File sharing. This is obvious but I want to emphasize how seamless this is. Nextcloud provides an interface similar to google drive or one drive for managing, uploading, and sharing files, and it works perfectly. It makes managing user permissions easy and finally gives me a way to share a link to files on my server. No need to try and get people to make user accounts, you can just send a link that opens to the files you want to share with a single link.\n2. Office. Nextcloud offers full office functionality for free, just like what you get with google drive but without all the pesky google getting in the way. I had no idea this was integrated and it is super convenient. But it gets better...\n3. Collaboration. One of the coolest things about google drive, at least when it was new because I still remember its launch, was the ability to collaborate in real time on a document. Nextcloud has the same capability in a completely self hosted package. And I can't emphasize this point enough, people don't need accounts. I wouldn't leave files unprotected for long, but for a short time you can share a link to a file and give everyone permission to edit the file. No accounts needed.\n4. Talk. In the past I have used rocket chat for a completely private chat server but next cloud talk is better. I love that it finally gives me an option for a self hosted video chat and phone chat system that's integrated into the normal text chat.\n5. Email and calendar. I have way too many email accounts that I have to check regularly, there are existing clients that let me bring everything into 1 place but many are local only. Nextcloud's lets me pull all my emails and calendars into a single place that can be accessed from anywhere.\n6. Customization. I run my own small business I can't tell you how cool it is to send a link to clients and instead of going to onedrive or google drive they go to a subdomain of my website and its fully branded. The background color even matches the rest of my site.\n7. Mobile backup. Basically says it all, photos can be backed up with the mobile app in real time. This is great!\n\nI think that covers it. I have no affiliation with nextcloud and I'm not an expert on it.

In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.\n\nI recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.\n\nI want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.\n\nSo my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?\n\nI am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.\n\nOr is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?\n\nThe new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path.

In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path.
