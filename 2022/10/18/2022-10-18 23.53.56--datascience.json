Not always possible, but if you can do it will help in understanding how you can generate value.\n\n\\- **Ask for feedback from your manager.** This is very underutilized. Asking for feedback makes you vulnerable, but it will help in understanding what your manager thinks is important. Plus, it shows that you are willing to learn (which is very important in business).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How to manage time\n\n\\- **Prioritize tasks before analysis.** Before touching data, making a list of all actions you need to do will give more clarity in the process and help in planning your time better. Data science comes with a lot of uncertainty, which will take some of them away. \n\n\\- **Use a data analytics project template.** A document where you describe your hypotheses, data needed, and stakeholders will make you way more efficient. \n\n\\- **Plan update meetings with stakeholders to create soft deadlines for yourself.** This helps you to work towards a date and get work done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How to communicate insights\n\n\\- **Learn good data visualization practices.** Understand how you structure a Powerpoint deck and how you present recommendations. I advise to google for Mckinsey's Powerpoint breakdown. \n\n\\- **Create a dialogue where questions can be asked.** The one you are communicating with will definitely have questions. Allow room in your communication for insights and ask \"was this clear?\" after complicated parts.\n\n\\- **Show you are trying to help, not to criticize.** Do not position yourself as the person that knows everything and that the other party is wrong. Be helpful and try to understand where they are coming from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### How to collaborate with others\n\n\\- **Write code together.** Writing code together helps to stay sharp and spot errors. This will lead to better work.\n\n\\- **Use Kanban boards to assign tasks and track progress.** Use Kanban boards to decompose big assignments into smaller tasks. Keep the board updated to track progress.\n\n\\- **Have multiple update calls per week.** This depends on the project, but having update calls with your peers \\~2 times per week to discuss challenges helps to spend less time on parts where you are stuck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully, this was useful for you.
