It would also be nice to take on a second gig that uses a different platform like AWS so I can keep myself relevant and up to date with all the main cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is anyone here doing this successfully ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "y3aayl", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrRedmondNYC", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 41, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/y3aayl/anyone_hold_down_two_de_positions_at_once/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/y3aayl/anyone_hold_down_two_de_positions_at_once/", "subreddit_subscribers": 76404, "created_utc": 1665695642.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Any experience with Dremio?

However, the ETL company they went with isn&amp;#39;t working out and I&amp;#39;m being tasked with building the pipeline. I do have a basic understanding, some of the technical skills and what I don&amp;#39;t know I can quickly learn. The money that was being spent on the ETL company is being reallocated and there&amp;#39;s nothing else in the budget for data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently I have Stitch set up to load some of our data sources in BigQuery and I&amp;#39;m creating views  in BigQuery to transform the data. It&amp;#39;s not a great solution but I needed something quick. The plan is to do the transformations in dbt. Stitch doesn&amp;#39;t have enough of the connectors we need, most notably Amazon Seller Central, so I&amp;#39;m exploring other options. I tried out AirByte but it&amp;#39;s too over normalized and I haven&amp;#39;t had success getting the BigQuery denormalized destination to work. I&amp;#39;ve also used Meltano some. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are some other good free options? If you were in my position what pipeline would you set up? It&amp;#39;s an ecommerce company so Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, Google Analytics, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Big Query, NetSuite are some of the connectors I&amp;#39;ll need. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any good learning resources out there for someone like me. I&amp;#39;m taking python courses and doing as much research as possible, reading Fundamentals of Data Engineering and Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform. But I really need to hit the ground running and would do better if I could learn as I go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "y3i3t1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lahma_mama", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/y3i3t1/data_analyst_tasked_with_building_data_pipeline/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/y3i3t1/data_analyst_tasked_with_building_data_pipeline/", "subreddit_subscribers": 76404, "created_utc": 1665716240.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_265t3i5h", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "46 Best Resources to learn Big Data (YouTube, Books, Courses, &amp;

If I follow general git control version principles, next year the code will have changed (new columns, additional features, different parameters, etc.).\n\nA situation that might happen is, in the future one might want to understand how a certain column was calculated in the past, or what logic is behind a certain business rule. You might want to even execute that old code again.\n\nThe complexity increases when there are different scenarios for budget, monthly forecasts and ad-hoc planning requirements.
