However, the ETL company they went with isn&amp;#39;t working out and I&amp;#39;m being tasked with building the pipeline. I do have a basic understanding, some of the technical skills and what I don&amp;#39;t know I can quickly learn. The money that was being spent on the ETL company is being reallocated and there&amp;#39;s nothing else in the budget for data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently I have Stitch set up to load some of our data sources in BigQuery and I&amp;#39;m creating views  in BigQuery to transform the data. It&amp;#39;s not a great solution but I needed something quick. The plan is to do the transformations in dbt. Stitch doesn&amp;#39;t have enough of the connectors we need, most notably Amazon Seller Central, so I&amp;#39;m exploring other options. I tried out AirByte but it&amp;#39;s too over normalized and I haven&amp;#39;t had success getting the BigQuery denormalized destination to work. I&amp;#39;ve also used Meltano some. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are some other good free options? If you were in my position what pipeline would you set up? It&amp;#39;s an ecommerce company so Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, Google Analytics, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Big Query, NetSuite are some of the connectors I&amp;#39;ll need. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any good learning resources out there for someone like me. I&amp;#39;m taking python courses and doing as much research as possible, reading Fundamentals of Data Engineering and Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform. But I really need to hit the ground running and would do better if I could learn as I go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "y3i3t1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lahma_mama", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/y3i3t1/data_analyst_tasked_with_building_data_pipeline/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/y3i3t1/data_analyst_tasked_with_building_data_pipeline/", "subreddit_subscribers": 76388, "created_utc": 1665716240.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Any experience with Dremio?
