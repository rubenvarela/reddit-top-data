I have a vision for what I want to build with Fasten, but I want to make sure it align's to the community's needs. \nIf you have a feature request or an idea (big or small) please don't hesitate to submit a Github Issue. \n\n[Fasten Issue Tracker](https://github.com/fastenhealth/docs/issues)\n\nI also have an [FAQ](https://github.com/fastenhealth/docs/blob/main/FAQs.md) that you might find interesting.\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to Fasten, please be aware of the following:\n\n- **I'll need a CLA from contributors** (atleast until I figure out a monetization strategy), I don't want to pigenhole my code into any specific license quite yet.\n- **Fasten will eventually be monetized** - this is due to the legal and privacy requirements imposed by Healthcare providers, and also because a \"self-hosted only\" service doesn't scale to people like my own parents. Open-source with a hosted version (similar to HomeAssistant) would be ideal here. \n- **Fasten may be (kind-of) cripple-ware.**  Given the security &amp; privacy requirements of Healthcare providers, there's a requirement to have a known cloud accessible component (Fasten Lighthouse) to act as an Authentication Gateway. This Gateway will never have access to credentials that can be used to access your data (excluding some that do not allow for native/mobile OAuth authentication flows). While you could compile the Fasten Self-hosted, you may only able to access limited functionality without a license to the Gateway (a monetization strategy I'm debating). This Gateway will eventually be source available.\n- **Security &amp; Compliance concerns may limit functionality** - while Fasten will not need to be HIPAA compliant (as its self-hosted), It's designed to be as secure and hardened as possible - the eventual goal is to release a hosted (HIPAA compliant) version. Security and privacy will be considerations from day 1. \n\nIf you're ok with all of those \"limitations\", please join us on Discord!  (I've fixed the invite link)\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Bykz6BAN8p\n\nIt's still a small community, but I hope to grow it in the open, and I'll be available to answer questions you might have. \n\nHere's the Github repo we're using to coordinate our work:\n\nhttps://github.com/fastenhealth/docs\n\n\n## Support\n\nIf you're interested in other ways to support Fasten, please consider Following the github organization\n\n[Org Follow button Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/GGPPPuc.png)\n\n\n[https://github.com/fastenhealth](https://github.com/fastenhealth)\n\nAttempting to get grants/raise funding for self-hosted applications is difficult, but it can be easier if theres significant interest &amp; engagement. \n\nAlso consider sharing your expertise. My career has primarily been working on complaint software/infrastructure (PCI, HIPAA, SOC, FedRAMP), however I'm sorely lacking in design/UI/UX, legal and healthcare expertise that would be incredibly valuable at this stage. \nConsider joining our [discord](https://discord.gg/Bykz6BAN8p) if you're interested in contributing. \n\n\nThanks!", "author_fullname": "t2_97kst", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fasten Open Sourced - BETA - A Self-hosted Personal Electronic Medical Record system", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "productannouncement", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_y32qmq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 42, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Product Announcement", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 42, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1665677668.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey reddit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a refresher: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/xj9rx7/introducing_fasten_a_selfhosted_personal/\"&gt;almost a month ago&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve been busy having (incredibly thought-provoking) conversations with some of you, chatting with HIPAA lawyers &amp;amp; professionals, and re-architecting the application to support zero-knowledge encryption. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s taken a lot longer than I expected, but thankfully the code is back to a state that is useable,  but still slightly embarrassing :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a quick summary of the changes I&amp;#39;ve made:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fasten has been rewritten/rearchitected to be a SPA/PWA. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fasten license changed to GPLv3 - and &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/fastenhealth/fasten-onprem\"&gt;Open Sourced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fasten is now designed to support &lt;code&gt;zero-knowledge encryption&lt;/code&gt; - all healthcare provider access is done on the client side, where data will (eventually) be encrypted with a user provided key BEFORE sending to backend/database.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Golang backend has been gutted, only webserver, CORS relay and couchDB shim remain.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Migrated from SQLite to CouchDB as internal datastore&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Code to communicate with healthcare providers has been moved to the frontend and will eventually be its own dedicated Typescript library. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All processing of data from healthcare providers is done inside web-workers - keeping the UI snappy. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;OAuth flow now leverages url &lt;code&gt;fragments&lt;/code&gt; allowing healthcare providers to pass back transient authorization codes without hitting a Fasten server.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Fasten Lighthouse (Auth Gateway) is now fully stateless!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Work-in-progress/Broken&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While refactoring Fasten to better support the SPA model, I did manage to break a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the built-in testuser &lt;code&gt;test@test.com&lt;/code&gt; no longer works, you&amp;#39;ll need to create your own user and attach sandbox healthcare providers yourself. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;manual uploads of FHIR bundles are not supported (functionality was removed during refactor -- will be re-added)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;refresh tokens (eventually used for background sync) may not be working consistently -- you may need to reconnect&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Still no encryption at rest. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it still has most of the same limitations as the original BETA:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  You can only connect to Sandbox accounts on the healthcare providers (no real/personal accounts yet).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#39;s only packaged as a Docker image&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Search is disabled&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Some error messages may not be displayed correctly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  The UI is fairly limited, no pretty graphs or dashboards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Join The Beta&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that Fasten is &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/fastenhealth/fasten-onprem\"&gt;Open Sourced&lt;/a&gt; all you need to do to get started is follow the instructions in the &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/fastenhealth/docs/blob/main/BETA.md\"&gt;BETA.md guide&lt;/a&gt; to get a &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; version of Fasten up and running. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you&amp;#39;re interested in hearing about Fasten updates, please consider filling out the following Google Form:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/eqtLQbcQaTBN4tuCA\"&gt;https://forms.gle/eqtLQbcQaTBN4tuCA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have feedback, positive or negative, please create a Github issue! I have a vision for what I want to build with Fasten, but I want to make sure it align&amp;#39;s to the community&amp;#39;s needs. \nIf you have a feature request or an idea (big or small) please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to submit a Github Issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/fastenhealth/docs/issues\"&gt;Fasten Issue Tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have an &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/fastenhealth/docs/blob/main/FAQs.md\"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that you might find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Contribute&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in contributing to Fasten, please be aware of the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ll need a CLA from contributors&lt;/strong&gt; (atleast until I figure out a monetization strategy), I don&amp;#39;t want to pigenhole my code into any specific license quite yet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fasten will eventually be monetized&lt;/strong&gt; - this is due to the legal and privacy requirements imposed by Healthcare providers, and also because a &amp;quot;self-hosted only&amp;quot; service doesn&amp;#39;t scale to people like my own parents. Open-source with a hosted version (similar to HomeAssistant) would be ideal here. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fasten may be (kind-of) cripple-ware.&lt;/strong&gt;  Given the security &amp;amp; privacy requirements of Healthcare providers, there&amp;#39;s a requirement to have a known cloud accessible component (Fasten Lighthouse) to act as an Authentication Gateway. This Gateway will never have access to credentials that can be used to access your data (excluding some that do not allow for native/mobile OAuth authentication flows). While you could compile the Fasten Self-hosted, you may only able to access limited functionality without a license to the Gateway (a monetization strategy I&amp;#39;m debating). This Gateway will eventually be source available.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;amp; Compliance concerns may limit functionality&lt;/strong&gt; - while Fasten will not need to be HIPAA compliant (as its self-hosted), It&amp;#39;s designed to be as secure and hardened as possible - the eventual goal is to release a hosted (HIPAA compliant) version. Security and privacy will be considerations from day 1. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re ok with all of those &amp;quot;limitations&amp;quot;, please join us on Discord!
