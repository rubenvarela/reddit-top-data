At $160k, the TC for this role is the largest one out of my remaining offers. I also am weighing a couple of data science positions, which range from $80k to $110k in TC. At the end of the day, I&amp;#39;d like to develop my career toward the data engineering route, but coming out of a more theoretical PhD where I slung a lot of spaghetti code, I&amp;#39;ve been applying to both stats-heavier data science positions that my background is more compatible with and junior data engineering openings to have a better chance of landing somewhere due to financial need. I had a verbal offer for a &amp;quot;Data Science - Engineer&amp;quot; opening at another company that would have been a better title fit (albeit with lower TC), but that offer never converted to an actual in-writing one unfortunately after I was notified that the company had instituted a hiring freeze, which may have been a white lie of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some advocate &amp;quot;finessing&amp;quot; ill-fitting titles for resumes and LinkedIn profiles, but one would obviously would need to bring out the original title for future background checks. In my negotiation process, I was not able to get the title changed. Is the title of the job something that could hurt me long-term due to the presence of the &amp;quot;data entry&amp;quot; phrase? I&amp;#39;ve looked around on here and on &lt;a href=\"/r/cscareerquestions\"&gt;r/cscareerquestions&lt;/a&gt;, and the general consensus seems to be that less conventional titles do not bring too much harm if they still sound somewhat technical, but &amp;quot;data entry&amp;quot; has the feel to me of corresponding to a much less rigorous role and carrying much worse connotations than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Appreciate your time and help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "ygugij", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hesperoyucca", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/ygugij/how_negatively_can_job_title_affect_career/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/ygugij/how_negatively_can_job_title_affect_career/", "subreddit_subscribers": 78340, "created_utc": 1667076852.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": " \n\nHey!\n\nOriginally posted this in a data analysis group, but was told that it might be more of a data engineering question than  data analysis. \n\nSo I am a mathematician by education but a software dev by trade (hopefully).
