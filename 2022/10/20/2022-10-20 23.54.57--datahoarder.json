They were bought together, and now I'm worried that they're going to die together as well. I took a look at the SMART info today and it got me concerned. I have backups of everything on both of them and my OS is installed on an SSD so I wouldn't lose any data if they did die, but of course I want to extend their life as much as possible. Hard drives don't grow on trees. \n\nThe drives are pretty old, the temperatures are okay and I do not have older SMART data to compare and see if the number of uncorrect/able and pending sectors is increasing or not. Here's the SMART info for both of them:\n\n[Disk 1](https://preview.redd.it/ug60strhvyu91.png?width=742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84d600814d5595a1533398dc35273eec46469951)\n\n[Disk 2](https://preview.redd.it/rgrb23ljvyu91.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec58be2ac7516b774c300ad2cb59c1154f9fae4)\n\nThere was also a bunch of errors:\n\n[Errors](https://preview.redd.it/qrdswytmvyu91.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0da395a230a205b365e77070631ba1486636ffc0)\n\nI am also very concerned about all the \"prefailure warning\" flags NOT on the attributes marked as problematic. \n\nBut oddly, with all this wrong, I still get the following message:\n\n&gt;=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===   \n&gt;  \n&gt;SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED\n\nSo, my questions to you fine people are: \n\n1.

Do i need to use Linux to do that? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "y8r8sl", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bigd1979666", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/y8r8sl/shucking_wd_mycloud_home_how_to_format/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/y8r8sl/shucking_wd_mycloud_home_how_to_format/", "subreddit_subscribers": 648405, "created_utc": 1666249859.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Fellow hoarders,\n\nthis is gonna be a long one, so TL;DR:   \n\"I am looking for ways to reorganise my backup solution that would relieve the USB connection either completely by outright avoiding it, or that could simplify the data stream through use of JBOD/DAS or even NAS with more sophisticated hardware unless the problem can indeed be easily and reliably identified and fixed in software or by introducing some intermediate extra hardware. \"\n\nI mainly hoard footage I am shooting and since it's both my passion and the professional endeavour that pays my bills, the storage is not just precious but also growing exponentially as the quality standards increase. A lot of the stuff I acquire isn't something that would get edited immediately if at all, but I still want to preserve it for the future possibilities or just the archive.\n\nAnyway, so I been doing manual backups for ages and actually have lost very little data since the mid-nineties. Recently I overhauled my scattered desktop empire and put 5-bay JBOD enclosure Sabrent DS-SC5B (elsewhere branded as Icy Box) at the centre of it, with 2x 16tb drives holding most of my footage, one mirroring the other, as well as many other 4-8tb drives that I could easily hotswap when needed. I do regular backups from my computer's workdisk on another disk within the enclosure and those two 16tb drives only get updated when the project or sorting is finished and the footage gets archived or offloaded temporarily to free up the SSDs. \n\nDespite the rocky start where some files got corrupted on IronWolf Pro (then sent to Seagate for recertified substitute, probably for no good reason), this worked well for almost a year. And yet recently I have had 3 occasions where files got corrupted again in a similar fashion -- and this time on 2 different disks, so I don't think it's a HDD issue. It's like the laptop loses the connection to the drive(s), unable to read it, and when it comes back (or when I am forced to reconnect it physically), some of the files are corrupted, in the last instance turning into zero sized nothings. After the second incident involving Exos, I purchased an equivalent one and backuped everything from the intact disk onto it, then reformatted the original backup Exos but losing the trust in the process -- what if it IS the disk? (SMART says no.)\n\nNow it looks like there are two possibilities:   \n1) It's the computer  \n2) It's the Sabrent enclosure\n\nBoth during the 1st incident and now again I got an error message: \"A device which does not exist was specified\". \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a58rhex4dxu91.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4612f9695f6e49124292ceda56ec0c2d1f806cf5\n\nThis time I have been using FreeFileSync to equalize the drives.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wblt01d3exu91.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe900292000b1bc94ee9791a9123142f51edf1bb\n\nI also went into Event Viewer to look at what error messages I can relate to the incidents and here they are:  \n\n\n&gt;04/09/2022 12:40:51  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Event ID: 51  \n&gt;  \n&gt;An error was detected on device \\\\Device\\\\Harddisk1\\\\DR19 during a paging operation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;05/09/2022 00:57:44  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Event ID: 153  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The IO operation at logical block address 0xdf0f66f8 for Disk 6 (PDO name: \\\\Device\\\\00000131) was retried.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;05/09/2022 00:57:44  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Event ID: 153  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The IO operation at logical block address 0x9e5d3f90 for Disk 7 (PDO name: \\\\Device\\\\0000014d) was retried.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;05/09/2022 00:57:46  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Event ID: 51  \n&gt;  \n&gt;An error was detected on device \\\\Device\\\\Harddisk6\\\\DR27 during a paging operation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;11/09/2022 04:35:57  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Event ID: 140  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The system failed to flush data to the transaction log.

My daily computer I do all the file management on, is Asus Zephyrus G14, bearing a fair amount of of things connected via USB at any given time. I do however use separate socket for the Sabrent enclosure and one of the times during corruption it was copying from an external disk also using a separate USB port on the other side of laptop, so presumably a different hub. The other time corruption happened seemingly within the enclosure (obviously not really as it's dumb but it was kind of working with itself).\n\nSince I doubt there are clear and certain methods accessible to me allowing to identify where the problem is and/or fixing it through software, I have half-accepted I may just never know and that the time and resources swallowed by trying to uncover the root of the issue might well be greater than just rebuilding the system in a different way and hoping for the best.\n\nI want to try a new enclosure, something that is very well made and thought out. Unfortunately, I am not spoiled by choice just because I don't need or want NAS: it doesn't suit my workflow, I don't need something that's always on, I also don't have the network infrastructure to make use of it (I have unlimited 5G tethered through my phone and that's it), and frankly I don't particularly want to pay for all the features I don't need.\n\nHowever, I'd like to finally get away from the USB but since my laptop doesn't have Thunderbolt ports, what else there is? Even allowing the USB, options for JBOD/DAS are not great, especially in 4+ bay range. Sabrent's offering is the best I could find, small footprint and good control of how you use it, allowing to easily hotswap drives and not spinning up any by default until you need them etc. I am just thinking it doesn't have the electronics to manage itself independently, so maybe there's an issue with the controller (coupled with my laptop's limitations), such as it can get oversaturated by the 5 drives when the ARE all on and just passes the buck to the laptop overwhelming it in the process? \n\nMaybe there are USB enclosures that have more electronics inside of them to manage this better, is what I hope -- but I haven't been able to find any yet. I would even consider buying NAS in the end, just because it has a computer inside whose sole function is to manage and safeguard data. Running their own OS independently, maybe they are flexible enough to get reconfigured in a more \"hands-on/on-demand\" fashion and somehow attached to my computers directly.\n\nAny suggestions? Both to the enclosure/NAS I could use or how to diagnose / circumvent the USB problem if it's USB problem.\n\nThxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "author_fullname": "t2_bahjz", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title":

My daily computer I do all the file management on, is Asus Zephyrus G14, bearing a fair amount of of things connected via USB at any given time. I do however use separate socket for the Sabrent enclosure and one of the times during corruption it was copying from an external disk also using a separate USB port on the other side of laptop, so presumably a different hub. The other time corruption happened seemingly within the enclosure (obviously not really as it&amp;#39;s dumb but it was kind of working with itself).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I doubt there are clear and certain methods accessible to me allowing to identify where the problem is and/or fixing it through software, I have half-accepted I may just never know and that the time and resources swallowed by trying to uncover the root of the issue might well be greater than just rebuilding the system in a different way and hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to try a new enclosure, something that is very well made and thought out. Unfortunately, I am not spoiled by choice just because I don&amp;#39;t need or want NAS: it doesn&amp;#39;t suit my workflow, I don&amp;#39;t need something that&amp;#39;s always on, I also don&amp;#39;t have the network infrastructure to make use of it (I have unlimited 5G tethered through my phone and that&amp;#39;s it), and frankly I don&amp;#39;t particularly want to pay for all the features I don&amp;#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;d like to finally get away from the USB but since my laptop doesn&amp;#39;t have Thunderbolt ports, what else there is? Even allowing the USB, options for JBOD/DAS are not great, especially in 4+ bay range. Sabrent&amp;#39;s offering is the best I could find, small footprint and good control of how you use it, allowing to easily hotswap drives and not spinning up any by default until you need them etc. I am just thinking it doesn&amp;#39;t have the electronics to manage itself independently, so maybe there&amp;#39;s an issue with the controller (coupled with my laptop&amp;#39;s limitations), such as it can get oversaturated by the 5 drives when the ARE all on and just passes the buck to the laptop overwhelming it in the process? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe there are USB enclosures that have more electronics inside of them to manage this better, is what I hope -- but I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find any yet. I would even consider buying NAS in the end, just because it has a computer inside whose sole function is to manage and safeguard data. Running their own OS independently, maybe they are flexible enough to get reconfigured in a more &amp;quot;hands-on/on-demand&amp;quot; fashion and somehow attached to my computers directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions? Both to the enclosure/NAS I could use or how to diagnose / circumvent the USB problem if it&amp;#39;s USB problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a9b81a26-bb69-11eb-8bca-0ea4446fb5bf", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "128TB", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "y8ubh5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ze77y", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/y8ubh5/looking_for_advanced_dasnas_enclosure/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/y8ubh5/looking_for_advanced_dasnas_enclosure/", "subreddit_subscribers": 648405, "created_utc": 1666261032.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
