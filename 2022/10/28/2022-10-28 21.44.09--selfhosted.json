He complained constantly on guides on YouTube and written media on \u201c\u2026how can I do this cool stuff if I can\u2019t even see what they are showing?!\u2026\u201d I\u2019m aware of the ability of adding alternative text but very few get it right including myself. \n\nI had him use the dummies guides and his screen reader was able to work with very little tweaking (markdown rules).\n\nI hope to one day add accessibility features to the site for more people to use. \n\nYour spelling and grammar is a problem!\n\nNot a question but yep, for starters I\u2019m British, we don\u2019t like \u2018z\u2019 and our center is centre. Yeah I know weird right! Also I\u2019m dyslexic, I do my best to run through via Word and Grammarly, but both aren\u2019t perfect either. If you see something, just let me know, I won\u2019t bite and appreciate it more than you think. \n\nI know of a better way of doing something, why would you do it that way?\n\nAmazing! I really want to know, I\u2019ll credit any work that comes over from others and majority have said don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m grateful to have others contribute even if it ends up being written with a hundred credits to others on Reddit. \n\nCan I request a dummies guide?\n\nOf course! I\u2019m going to eventually create a request system and have a list on the website of them all in the works. It takes on average 4 days to make and verify. More testers who offer help; the quicker it can be released. \n\nNow the question I\u2019m asking, what\u2019s next?\n\nWell I am going to take a few days worth of rest and maybe a little light planning. Then I\u2019m going to get the next three done\n\n* Caddy\n* Vaultwarden\n* Plex with NFS / Samba (SMB) storage. \n\nDepending on how the next set go, if there is high demand on them, I may consider a subscription style ($1 a month like Garbage Time / DankPods with a $2 sub where $1 goes to a Autism charity) where I\u2019ll be adding add-on features to the dummies guides. Some I\u2019m considering as this are\n\n* Nginx proxy manager streams others etc\n* Custom bots on Matrix, like server monitoring and information from Portainer as an example. \n\nI will always keep the dummies guides free for everyone and can be held as a guarantee. Including backups of it too. But by all means share your views on this good and bad. \n\nFinally, I\u2019d like to thank you all again for an fantastic community and huge appreciation to everyone that\u2019s helped out. Truly means a lot. \n\nFor those who want to thank me\u2026 As someone who is Autistic and has an Autistic nephew please donate anything, from money/time to sensory toys, to your local Autism charity or Food Bank, that for me is the biggest thanks anyone can give!\n\nHappy Self Hosting!", "author_fullname": "t2_ecn42vsv", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dummies Guides x3", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "guide", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yfjahk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 170, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Guide", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 170, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666948761.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Go check out new dummies guides&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since my last &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ycelsb/a_dummies_guide_to_matrix/\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I received overwhelmingly positive feedback and amazing constructive criticism that helped shape the next batch, I am happy to be releasing 3 new guides right before the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/001-authentik/\"&gt;Authentik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/005-npm/\"&gt;Nginx Proxy Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/003-vscode/\"&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fully appreciate that one of these are covered in lots of places but the idea is you can come to one site and could get 4 services online in a single day with little knowledge (soon zero knowledge) is what excites me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have had a few questions and I\u2019d like to answer some here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you not have any pictures in your guides?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s actually very simple, my friend is blind.
