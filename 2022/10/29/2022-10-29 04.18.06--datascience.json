I know a Pipeline when I see it, but despite reading tutorial after tutorial on Pipelines I cannot find an answer to what makes a Pipeline a different beast from a bunch of functions. For that matter, a lot of this stuff sounds like functions but...aren&amp;#39;t? Does this have something to do with the functional versus object oriented programming debate? My limited understanding of this debate is that functional programming is logical and object oriented makes me disoriented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a book everyone read that I didn&amp;#39;t hear about??? I want to be able to look at readthedocs and have that convey to my brain what to type in Python, without resorting to monkey business. How do I get my brain there?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yg8tv9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hotdatassss", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/yg8tv9/how_can_i_stop_using_sklearn_like_a_monkey/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/yg8tv9/how_can_i_stop_using_sklearn_like_a_monkey/", "subreddit_subscribers": 815994, "created_utc": 1667014375.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I\u2019m a complete beginner at statistics and I have a project I need to work on.
