The company is much larger than my previous job, which was a part-time bookkeeping at a small church. And I feel kind of lost and anxious. I wasn&amp;#39;t able to ask as many questions as I wanted to this first week. It looks like everyone else is pretty busy, as they immediately jump off the call when the scheduled end time hits. Today I attended a meeting with my direct manager and two other team members (one of whom was assigned to me as my mentor of sorts) to discuss requirements for a project they want me to work on, and it was all over the place. I wasn&amp;#39;t able to follow any of it aside from the first few minutes, and the rest of the meeting was the two other team members and my direct manager talking about something that happened a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been reassured by my direct manager that I&amp;#39;m basically going to be useless for the first few weeks, because their IT is notoriously slow and they have yet to install everything on my work computer I need. But it&amp;#39;s doing little for my nerves. I do try to keep myself busy. I do make sure I tried a couple of things before I ask questions; I know these people are busy. I haven&amp;#39;t even finished looking through everything they sent me yet. I&amp;#39;ve never received so many emails in my entire life continuously. Is it normal to feel like everything is already piling on?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yg94a1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "currentgradstudent", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/yg94a1/feeling_mostly_anxious_about_my_new_internship/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/yg94a1/feeling_mostly_anxious_about_my_new_internship/", "subreddit_subscribers": 816024, "created_utc": 1667015264.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "3 months in as a new data analyst at a state university.

To prepare the string data for use with the algorithm I transformed the strings to ascii, and then have tried a few different methods to induce normality (log and boxcox). The issue is I&amp;#39;m losing information through the transformation process so I can&amp;#39;t convert the data back to the proper email strings after I&amp;#39;ve clustered them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any recommendations for how to deal with this problem? Better approaches to solving the overall problem are also very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "937a6f50-d780-11e7-826d-0ed1beddcc82", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yg15gk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JimBeanery", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/yg15gk/clustering_string_methodologies/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/yg15gk/clustering_string_methodologies/", "subreddit_subscribers": 816024, "created_utc": 1666992656.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I was reading this section:[https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/references.html#reference-tables](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/references.html#reference-tables)\n\nI want to create automatic references/indexes for some printed pandas df but I don't want to paste the text in the cell to use the {table} chunk.
