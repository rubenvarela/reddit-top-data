The company I worked for and product I sold was in the Business Intelligence space, so I wanted to learn everything about it. I quickly became the most technical salesperson in my org, and tried to transition to a more technical solutions engineer role, but was blocked by management. So I left after 18 months. \n\nSalary: $80k\n\nTitle: Account Executive\n\nI worked selling a competing product to the former product, again learning everything I could. I began to learn SQL. After 14 months, I was laid off as the whole division went under. \n\nSalary: $100k\n\nTitle: Sr. Analyst\n\nI went to work in the healthcare space. Because of how technical I had become in my first sales job, I easily qualified for a tool-specific specialist at healthcare company. I was by far the most advanced on my team in this tool. My SQL was my biggest weakness, and I learned fast and studied countless hours outside of work. I left after 3 years due to lack of opportunity for advancement and political messes. \n\nSalary: $150k+$15k bonus \n\nTitle: Technical Lead\n\nI worked as a contractor for a FAANG company which is a great brand for my resume, but I was just a lowly contractor. I led complex projects writing SQL and a tiny bit of python. I studied python a lot. After 2 years, I tried to convert to FTE and it became obvious that it wouldn\u2019t happen. For the last 5 months, I spent about 5 hours a day studying algorithms and data structures and/or interviewing. After 2.5 years, I resigned. \n\nSalary: $175k+$25k bonus+$87k stock+$40k sign on bonus\n\nTitle: Data Engineer\n\nI received probably 5 offers between about 30 interviews. I got 1 FAANG offer ($225k, L5 BIE) 1 Top N offer ($287k DE) and 1 fortune 100 offer ($250k Sr DE). My advice here is that; I knew algorithms and data structures would be my weakness, so I focused there. With solid SQL, Algos, and behavioral, the rest I would need to figure out as I went. I began making lists of of topics that I was weak in as I went through more and more interviews, and I would get a few inches deep into each topic and/or make study sheets and flash cards as I went. A large element of this was luck. I focused on concepts, not tools. Normal forms, for example, are conceptual and tool-agnostic. There was also a massive luck element to this game. Some companies went for hard algos questions; I failed those interviews. Some interviewers wanted to talk about optimizing a pig job; I failed that interview. Was pig worth learning because one company asked about it? No. I stayed the course of conceptual topics. \n\nDespite my title as a Technical Lead as a contractor at FAANG, I interviewed for a Sr. role. Because the scope of some of the projects I worked on didn\u2019t impact multiple technical teams, I was down-leveled to entry-level Data Engineer. I declined the offer, and planned to accept another offer. A week later, the recruiter contacted me again and told me things changed on their end and they really wanted me.
