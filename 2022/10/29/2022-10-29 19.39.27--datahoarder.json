Googling around, it seems like this is some kind of recurring quality issue with these drives that Samsung refuses to acknowledge. My drive was only a year old with ~35TB written so well within the warranty. Kind of unfortunate since Samsung always seems to be heralded as the king of reliability in the SSD market.\n\nAs for the RMA process, the first thing I would suggest is registering your drive on Samsung's website and attempting to start a repair service request from there. I personally don't know how this works because every time I tried to do this it gave me a server error, but I imagine it's probably a more seamless process than what I went through when it actually works.\n\nThe second thing I tried was contacting them through their contact form [here](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/support/) (\"Contact us\" at the bottom), but I ended up just getting an automated response a week or so later telling me to read their support FAQ which was useless.\n\nThe thing that ended up working was e-mailing samsungmemorysupport@sea.samsung.com directly with my RMA request, including attached screenshots of my SMART info + SMART test showing errors.\nThis initiated a ticket in their system, in which they requested the following information:\n\n&gt; Dear Customer, \n\n&gt; Thank you for contacting Samsung Memory support. \n\n&gt; If you wish to have your unit repaired, please reply and provide a copy of your Receipt or Invoice along with the following information: \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; **All the Following Must Be Answered as Best as Possible** \n\n&gt; 1)Company Name (If Applicable): \n\n&gt; 2) Name (First, Last): \n\n&gt; 3) Full Address (PO box is NOT accepted): \n\n&gt; 4) Email: \n\n&gt; 5) Phone Number: \n\n&gt; 6) Product Number: \n\n&gt; 7) Serial Number (Located on the label on the bottom of the SSD.): \n\n&gt; 8) Detailed Reason for Repair: \n\n&gt; 9) Troubleshooting Performed: \n\n&gt; 10) Computer Specifications (Please provide any system information if available): \n\n&gt; 11) Bill of Sale (Invoice or Receipt must be in an JPEG image file format or PDF. Please do not paste but attach it to your reply email): \n\n&gt; 12) Photo of the Label on the SSD for verification (not the packaging. Please do not paste but attach it to your reply email) \n\n&gt; 13) Please write YES in this field to denote that you have accepted our warranty terms and conditions (Listed Below):\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Please note: \n\n&gt; 1) Update ticket with requested info and attachments. \n\n&gt; 2) Proof of Purchase (PoP) required for customers outside the US and Canada, though we may ask for it from US and Canadian customers in some situations. Without PoP, we will use the unit's manufacturing date. \n\n&gt; 3) Email confirmation with service ticket number will be provided typically within 24 business hours of receiving your request, not including weekends or holidays. \n\n&gt; 4) Customers are responsible for shipping the SSD to our Service Center and will receive an address to ship the unit to in the confirmation email. Customers outside the US and Canada must include a pre-paid return label in the package with the unit. Customers within the continental US may be offered an accommodation at time of request. \n\n&gt; 5) The full warranty policy is found here: http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/support/warranty.html\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 6) For SSDs, please make sure to include only the unit for repair, do not include any accessories (cables, adapters, screws, manuals, etc). Any accessories or original packaging will be discarded and will not be returned. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 7) For Portable SSDs, please send in the unit and the cable(s) that were provided with the unit on purchase. Any other accessories or original packaging will be discarded and will not be returned. \n\n&gt; 8) Please note repair procedure wipes any data on the SSD. Please make sure to have your data backed up before sending in the drive. \n\n&gt; 9) If your unit cannot be repaired, following Samsung Policy, If the unit was manufactured within 90 days, based on the manufacture date, or purchased within 90 days and you provided us with the proof of purchase, Samsung will attempt to send you a new unit. Outside 90 days, Samsung will replace your unit with only a re-certified unit, which is guaranteed to work as well as a new unit.\n\nThe proof of purchase I provided was just a screenshot of my Amazon invoice for the drive, seemed to be fine.\n\nAfter providing this information, it took them 7 business days to open an RMA (original e-mail sent on September 23rd, sent additional e-mail on September 27th asking for a follow-up (no response), RMA opened on October 4th).\n\nOnce the RMA was opened, I received 3 e-mails, one from the support assigned to my ticket telling me the RMA has been opened, giving me my ticket number, and telling me to expect an e-mail from UPS containing a pre-paid shipping label. The second e-mail was an automated one from the ticketing system that apparently allowed me to track the repair progress, but in my experience this didn't really work at all. The third e-mail was the pre-paid UPS label, note that as stated above, they only want the SSD itself, not the box or cables, etc.\nI also received a text message with a separate link than the one above that allowed me to track the progress, but oddly enough this showed completely different information to the one e-mailed to me. This tracker actually still shows my original ticket as open, and that they are \"preparing to ship out your repaired unit\". Again, pretty much completely useless and confusing.\n\nBefore shipping the drive out, I ran a secure erase on it through Samsung's Magician software. I've seen multiple posts recommending against running a secure erase before RMAing SSDs because it tends to mask issues by forcing the drive to reallocate sectors, and then they'll refuse your RMA because they can't replicate the issue, but in my case it didn't cause any problems with the process.\n\nI shipped the package on October 5th, and they received it October 7th.\nI received an e-mail on October 10th saying the unit had been received and to expect it to be repaired within the next 7 days.\nOn October 13th, I received another e-mail saying a new ticket had been opened and that my \"exchange request has been allocated\", at this point the first ticket was closed as completed. The new ticket gave a new tracking link, but only provided very basic information about what was happening, so it wasn't really clear when they actually shipped out the drive or what was happening. I was never provided any kind of shipping notification or tracking code for the package. That e-mail was the last communication I had with them. I ended up receiving the replacement SSD on October 21st, using the tracking code on the package I can see it was originally shipped on the 17th. So basically the series of events goes:\n\n&gt; 9/23: Sent RMA request e-mail\n\n&gt; 10/4: RMA opened\n\n&gt; 10/5: Drive shipped out\n\n&gt; 10/7: Drive received by Samsung\n\n&gt; 10/10: Samsung confirms they've received drive\n\n&gt; 10/13: Exchange allocated\n\n&gt; 10/17: Replacement drive shipped out\n\n&gt; 10/21: Replacement drive received\n\nI ended up receiving what seems like a brand new 870 EVO 1TB as a replacement (production date is 2022-09-19).\n\nAll in all the process was pretty obtuse and there was a pretty bad lack of communication, but it worked in the end so I guess it's fine. I spent a lot of time just trying to hunt down what the correct way to even file an RMA was since the official method seems to be doing it through their website, which never worked for me.\n\nI've also read that you can initiate an RMA over the phone by directly calling their memory support department (1-888-480-5655), but I always save calling support numbers as an absolute last resort since it's usually such a terrible experience.\n\nHopefully this can help anyone else facing similar issues.", "author_fullname": "t2_5kann", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Samsung SSD RMA Experience", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ygfnwe", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 99, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 99, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667037593.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;m in the US, this process may be different outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Figured I&amp;#39;d post my RMA experience here since I&amp;#39;m sure there are a lot of Samsung SSD owners here, may save you some time if you need to RMA one of their drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day my OS crashed while trying to acess a file and upon rebooting, the boot drive (870 EVO 1TB) was reporting SMART read errors, and it seemingly couldn&amp;#39;t reallocate the sectors properly.
