The features I actually use from Nextcloud are just WebDAV access to my files (via Mountain Duck), and CalDAV/CardDAV sync to my phone and laptop.  \nI've been considering replacing NC with the following services and would like some opinions on a few points:   \n- SFTPGo as a file server: Mountain Duck can connect to SFTP servers, and on iOS the SFTP File Provider app can plug into the native Files app to browse my files. SFTPGo also has a WebDAV module which I can use to sync browser bookmarks with Floccus. My main question is, how do WebDAV and SFTP compare, performance-wise? I have had the feeling that WebDAV's transfer speed through Mountain Duck is a bit inconsistent, and it doesn't deal very well with large files, but I'm not sure whether SFTP will fare any better there.   \n- Radicale for CalDAV/CardDAV. Not much more to say on this one.  \n- Filebrowser or Filestash as a WebUI to browse my files if needed. On that note, is there an ARM64 Docker image of Filestash anywhere? The offical repo only provides AMD64.    \n\nThe goal is to replace a big monolith of an app (Nextcloud), with a few more lightweight services and maybe reduce the load on my server.

The features I actually use from Nextcloud are just WebDAV access to my files (via Mountain Duck), and CalDAV/CardDAV sync to my phone and laptop.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve been considering replacing NC with the following services and would like some opinions on a few points:&lt;br/&gt;\n- SFTPGo as a file server: Mountain Duck can connect to SFTP servers, and on iOS the SFTP File Provider app can plug into the native Files app to browse my files. SFTPGo also has a WebDAV module which I can use to sync browser bookmarks with Floccus. My main question is, how do WebDAV and SFTP compare, performance-wise? I have had the feeling that WebDAV&amp;#39;s transfer speed through Mountain Duck is a bit inconsistent, and it doesn&amp;#39;t deal very well with large files, but I&amp;#39;m not sure whether SFTP will fare any better there.&lt;br/&gt;\n- Radicale for CalDAV/CardDAV. Not much more to say on this one.&lt;br/&gt;\n- Filebrowser or Filestash as a WebUI to browse my files if needed. On that note, is there an ARM64 Docker image of Filestash anywhere? The offical repo only provides AMD64.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal is to replace a big monolith of an app (Nextcloud), with a few more lightweight services and maybe reduce the load on my server.
