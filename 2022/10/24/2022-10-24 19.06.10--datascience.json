So I had to work extra hard to learn all that stuff within 4-5 days, which I did by working late into the night. The last 2 days I was working deep into the night, trying to get the deployment right and the k8s cluster to function as expected, until 4:30 am.\n\nSo anyway, I submitted the assignment, satisfied and happy that I was able to get the thing working. The recruiter informed me that the company would like to interview me for the next round, hurray. In the interview, I explained to them how I built the model, how I deployed it, how it would take care of variable loads, etc. **Then they asked me, how do you do model versioning and retraining?** Honestly, I've never done it using any formal tooling purpose-built for this task. I just rename my models with a timestamp and that's how I do it. So I said as much and also that I use Git for versioning. Well, they said Git is good for versioning code, but it's not sufficient for models.\n\nAnyway, got the news from the recruiter that I didn't pass the interview. I looked up (Googled) \"model versioning\" after the interview, it seems I needed to reply with \"ML Flow\" as the answer. If only I could blabber, \"I use MLflow and Jenkins for model versioning and CICD/orchestration\", I think I would have gotten through to the next round in the interview process. But alas, getting through to 90-95% of the way - **starting from zero mind you** - isn't enough anymore. Because if it was, they could have known or understood that if this guy can learn docker and kuberbetes and GKE within 4-5 days and build a working prototype of an app, compete with a UI and everything, as a full-fledged product with a deep-learning model that he fine-tuned on custom data, then he can definitely learn f**kin MLflow and Jenkins within another week. \n\nOh and, they never even proposed to reimburse me for the ~ US$ 22 that I spent on building and running the cluster for a week. Not that $22 matters a lot to me - in fact I'm glad I learnt how to use GKE within 3-4 days with that $22, so it's money well spent imo - but it is a matter of principles, honour, ethics and just plain old manners.\n\nSo, do you think my frustration and hurt is justified?

If only I could blabber, &amp;quot;I use MLflow and Jenkins for model versioning and CICD/orchestration&amp;quot;, I think I would have gotten through to the next round in the interview process. But alas, getting through to 90-95% of the way - &lt;strong&gt;starting from zero mind you&lt;/strong&gt; - isn&amp;#39;t enough anymore. Because if it was, they could have known or understood that if this guy can learn docker and kuberbetes and GKE within 4-5 days and build a working prototype of an app, compete with a UI and everything, as a full-fledged product with a deep-learning model that he fine-tuned on custom data, then he can definitely learn f**kin MLflow and Jenkins within another week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and, they never even proposed to reimburse me for the ~ US$ 22 that I spent on building and running the cluster for a week. Not that $22 matters a lot to me - in fact I&amp;#39;m glad I learnt how to use GKE within 3-4 days with that $22, so it&amp;#39;s money well spent imo - but it is a matter of principles, honour, ethics and just plain old manners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, do you think my frustration and hurt is justified? Or do you think they&amp;#39;re right in having rejected me instead of seeing my potential? Personally, I feel like if a company is only gonna employ people that fulfil 100% of their requirements, where is the scope of growth in it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ycgxzf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ResearcherNo4728", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 16, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/ycgxzf/got_rejected_from_ml_engineer_role_despite/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ycgxzf/got_rejected_from_ml_engineer_role_despite/", "subreddit_subscribers": 815158, "created_utc": 1666631802.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi everyone =) I just wanted to ask a quick question now that I am more familiar with ML models.\n\nI have read and read many articles stating the (sometimes many) assumptions of different models, be it linear or logistic regression, support vector machines, and so on.
