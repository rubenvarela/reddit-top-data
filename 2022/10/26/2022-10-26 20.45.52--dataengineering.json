I might be a Sr. engineer but I still have much to learn and my experiences might be not a true reflection of the market.\n\n# Things To Consider:\n\n* This is more specific for boot camp grads. An interviewer will see the same \"Airflow pipeline with &lt;insert name of free API  here&gt; data\" project a million times with the same structure, tests, and GitHub readme. A lot of bootcamps (and online courses) tend to steer their students to reuse projects from previous years over and over, which leaves you at a huge disadvantage. If you think this is you, take the time to work on other things.  \n\n* I thought everyone knew this but obviously, some missed the memo. Data engineering is not exempt from TDD practices. If can't talk about testing during the interview, this is a massive red flag.  \n\n* Unwillingness to learn SWE concepts/topics will hurt you in the long run. It will not make it easy to interview at companies where Data Engineers are treated as specialized software engineers, or where you are expected to work with other engineers (Backend, DevOps, Architecture, Networking, etc).   \n\n* Focus on collaboration during technical interviews. Getting to the right answer is great, but a lot of companies will not consider you if you don't communicate with whoever is interviewing you. Being silent during the entire coding session makes it awkward and makes interviewers think you won't be a good fit in a collaborative team.   \n\n* For the love of god, come prepared with questions before an interview. And something else besides \"what is &lt;insert name of company&gt;, what do you do?\".   \n\n* If you are applying to a position but have no experience (internships, coops, freelancing, etc.) or just come straight out of an 18-week boot camp course. Please understand that you must put in 300% more effort in the interview and your portfolio than most candidates. I would love to hire folks like this, mentor them, and see them become great developers (and I have). Unfortunately, for 1 job application I publish, I get \\~170 applicants within a couple days sometimes. It is hard to say no to experience when jobs in the DE space are so popular these days. Maybe get an internship first or find a small startup that is willing to give you a shot.   \n\n* There are sooooo many companies out there misusing the term \"Data Engineering\" in job postings. Some are just glorified BI/DA positions with fancy titles or jobs where you don't code and end up becoming stuck in a career where you will have a hard time making moves to other engineering positions. In my opinion, data engineers shouldn't settle for such jobs. Ask questions to weed out these jobs during the interview process if you really want to become a proper DE (sorry if it sounds a bit harsh, I truly appreciate good BI developers and Data analysts)  \n\n* Finally, weekend projects and open-source contributions are always cool to see. I support those who want to keep their personal time completely separate from doing anything related to development. But you know, it's cool to see folks passionate about learning or contributing to our community. \n\nThese are just a couple things that jumped out at me during the past three months.

"selftext": "I have been using GCP for quite some time and I play the role of a senior data engineer in a consulting form. Now I have 2 roles to choose from where I am very confused:   \n\n\n1.Principal Data Engineer (GCP) at one of the country's leading insurance firms. They are migrating from on prem to GCP and would like me to be their SME for the engineering, road map and DBT practices. The role is quite lucrative for me as I want to grow more into the Data Architecting Space, and I will be working closely with a senior data architect here  \n\n\n2. Chief Data Engineer at a Startup Fintech (domain: investment portfolio management) - 8bn worth of assets locked. They use AZURE &amp; SNOWFLAKE heavily and they don't have any data engineer in the team. Most of the pipelines are by the data scientist themselves. I will be in charge to put down framework and bring change/processes. The remuneration is really good to ignore the offer totally.  \n\n\nI am very confused at the moment to which one to proceed with!! As a data engineer should we be wary about the Cloud platform we work on, or should we be cloud agnostic?  I can hear things like \"AWS is the past, Azure is the present, GCP is the future\"! I have little exposure to Azure and did not like the experience. Azure seems to be very much \"DATABRICK\"-ish while they try to bring in new features at par with other cloud. On first glance ADF seems to be just rebranding SSIS with some new features.   \n\n\nWhile GCP is not the big elephant, it provides a very good ecosystem for data &amp; analytics. Now they have introduced, big lake, iceberg support, dataplex etc. Azure has no equivalent counterpart and rather they seem to borrow more from other service providers (databricks).  Even Kubernetes, Apache beam has their history originating from Google.  Also, GCP is really getting smarter &amp; creative as an ecosystem for Data and Analytics. Big query is their MVP and is really playing head-to-head with Snowflake. People are moving out of Spark/Hadoop framework and going back to such cloud-based SQL providers.

Now I have 2 roles to choose from where I am very confused:   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.Principal Data Engineer (GCP) at one of the country&amp;#39;s leading insurance firms. They are migrating from on prem to GCP and would like me to be their SME for the engineering, road map and DBT practices. The role is quite lucrative for me as I want to grow more into the Data Architecting Space, and I will be working closely with a senior data architect here  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Chief Data Engineer at a Startup Fintech (domain: investment portfolio management) - 8bn worth of assets locked. They use AZURE &amp;amp; SNOWFLAKE heavily and they don&amp;#39;t have any data engineer in the team. Most of the pipelines are by the data scientist themselves. I will be in charge to put down framework and bring change/processes. The remuneration is really good to ignore the offer totally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am very confused at the moment to which one to proceed with!! As a data engineer should we be wary about the Cloud platform we work on, or should we be cloud agnostic?  I can hear things like &amp;quot;AWS is the past, Azure is the present, GCP is the future&amp;quot;! I have little exposure to Azure and did not like the experience. Azure seems to be very much &amp;quot;DATABRICK&amp;quot;-ish while they try to bring in new features at par with other cloud. On first glance ADF seems to be just rebranding SSIS with some new features.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While GCP is not the big elephant, it provides a very good ecosystem for data &amp;amp; analytics. Now they have introduced, big lake, iceberg support, dataplex etc. Azure has no equivalent counterpart and rather they seem to borrow more from other service providers (databricks).  Even Kubernetes, Apache beam has their history originating from Google.  Also, GCP is really getting smarter &amp;amp; creative as an ecosystem for Data and Analytics. Big query is their MVP and is really playing head-to-head with Snowflake. People are moving out of Spark/Hadoop framework and going back to such cloud-based SQL providers. Synapse is very new and i don&amp;#39;t know how much people have embraced Synapse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking about future I felt enterprises would love to go ahead with GCP rather than Azure for Data Engineering/Analytics platform (unless they have some Licensing dependencies of legacy systems).
