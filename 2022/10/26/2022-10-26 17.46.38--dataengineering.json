An interviewer will see the same \"Airflow pipeline with &lt;insert name of free API  here&gt; data\" project a million times with the same structure, tests, and GitHub readme. A lot of bootcamps (and online courses) tend to steer their students to reuse projects from previous years over and over, which leaves you at a huge disadvantage. If you think this is you, take the time to work on other things.  \n\n* I thought everyone knew this but obviously, some missed the memo. Data engineering is not exempt from TDD practices. If can't talk about testing during the interview, this is a massive red flag.  \n\n* Unwillingness to learn SWE concepts/topics will hurt you in the long run. It will not make it easy to interview at companies where Data Engineers are treated as specialized software engineers, or where you are expected to work with other engineers (Backend, DevOps, Architecture, Networking, etc).   \n\n* Focus on collaboration during technical interviews. Getting to the right answer is great, but a lot of companies will not consider you if you don't communicate with whoever is interviewing you. Being silent during the entire coding session makes it awkward and makes interviewers think you won't be a good fit in a collaborative team.   \n\n* For the love of god, come prepared with questions before an interview. And something else besides \"what is &lt;insert name of company&gt;, what do you do?\".   \n\n* If you are applying to a position but have no experience (internships, coops, freelancing, etc.) or just come straight out of an 18-week boot camp course. Please understand that you must put in 300% more effort in the interview and your portfolio than most candidates. I would love to hire folks like this, mentor them, and see them become great developers (and I have). Unfortunately, for 1 job application I publish, I get \\~170 applicants within a couple days sometimes. It is hard to say no to experience when jobs in the DE space are so popular these days. Maybe get an internship first or find a small startup that is willing to give you a shot.   \n\n* There are sooooo many companies out there misusing the term \"Data Engineering\" in job postings. Some are just glorified BI/DA positions with fancy titles or jobs where you don't code and end up becoming stuck in a career where you will have a hard time making moves to other engineering positions. In my opinion, data engineers shouldn't settle for such jobs. Ask questions to weed out these jobs during the interview process if you really want to become a proper DE (sorry if it sounds a bit harsh, I truly appreciate good BI developers and Data analysts)  \n\n* Finally, weekend projects and open-source contributions are always cool to see. I support those who want to keep their personal time completely separate from doing anything related to development. But you know, it's cool to see folks passionate about learning or contributing to our community. \n\nThese are just a couple things that jumped out at me during the past three months.

Samsung&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a data engineer who has had the privilege of using both Snowflake and Databricks, I want to provide my own take on this debate by using an analogy in the consumer electronics space to illustrate the difference between these two companies at a philosophical level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this post came after I saw this ad released by Samsung, mocking Apple for being so behind in technology:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

was immediately reminded of the Databricks sales people and solutions architects I&amp;#39;ve worked with, who always talk about things like Performance, TPC-DS benchmarks, Photon, Spark etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, Snowflake sales people are more focused on the business value, use cases, and practical applications of their product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Snowflake&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th

Like S3, Glue - Spark, EMR, Fargate, Lambdas, Step functions,...\n\nThe requirements would be to be more independant of hyperscaler, data sharing, to have better access rights, less friction, less maintenance , ...\n\nPrimary use would be data engineering / analytics, but Data Science would be ofcourse a plus.\n\nAt first glance one sees like dbt+snowflake would rock, on the other hand databricks seems to offer more capabilities (including unity catalog) - and we now use spark already and delta tables, so it seems like a preferred choice. Maybe a combination of two, but having multiple moving migrating targets seems not that great with also current ongoing development. Maybe two step approach (first databricks, then maybe snowflake)? Is there anything else on the market - just seen Dremio and Dataiku but not really evaluated them.\n\nPlease share your experiences (any).
