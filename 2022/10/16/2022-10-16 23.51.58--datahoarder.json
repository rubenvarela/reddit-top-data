While DrivePool is not a backup, it is a tool that *should* help me in a drive failure scenario. What it wasn't configured for was what happens when 2 drives happen to die at the same time. Over the course of about a week I noticed my server getting slower and slower to respond, to the point where the system would lock up until I turned off my external drive bay. Well good, at least I've narrowed it down.\n\nIn what seems like typical Seagate fashion, it turns out that somehow 2 of my 4TB drives bit the bullet the same time. StableBit Scanner confirmed that for me, multiple dead sectors on each drive. Pulled the drives, looked at them and sure enough these are Refurbished drives directly from Seagate as part of a warranty swap (meaning these have already died on me once). Either way, drives pulled and off I was.\n\nExcept, not everything was hunky dory. I hadn't realized this at first, but it turns out as part of 2 drives failing, data loss had happened. These drives mostly store Plex content for me, but what was irreplaceable was my \"NAS\" share, including Photos and personal documents that are encrypted through Cryptomator. I clued in at first when Cryptomator was unlocking to a blank folder.\n\nUnfortunately for me, because I hadn't realized at first, and because I utilize rclone sync instead of copy, the \"corrupted\" Cryptomator (which was missing actual encrypted files so it couldn't unlock properly) had already synced to B2. Thankfully, when configuring B2 I decided to program the lifecycle settings to keep all versions of files. So I knew the files where there, but \"hidden.\"\n\nI tried doing a snapshot of the folder in Backblaze, but that was missing files and I'm not entirely sure why.

It looks like the type B cages can mount to 120MM fan mounts and there are 4 at the top of the case.  I can easily drill some extra holes in the cages unless you guys have something similar that allows stacking.  Also with 4 fans up front and 2 fans in the rear I don't think air flow and drive temps would be an issue at all.\n\nEdit:  I should point out this will not have a motherboard.
