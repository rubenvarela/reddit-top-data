I tested all the parts and they all work correctly. The vhs player plays the tap back correctly on tv, capture card can display the vhs play fine. Its just when the I capture. Is this a tbc problem? The  JVC HR-9500U I have has a time corrector in it and I had sure it was on but still have the problem. Do I have to get another tbc?

There seem to be 5 per backplane.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that these are fan connectors and that the 2 on the left of the plane are for the 2 fans on the back of the case, and the three on the right are for the three fans just before the planes. If that is the case, are there 5 per backplane so all fans can work when only a single backplane is powered by the molex?\n\nPerhaps I've answered my own question or perhaps I'm dead wrong. Very curious to find out.\n\nps. I intend to connect the fans to the PWM slot on the motherboard for better handling of speed and such.\n\nThanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fg2uvov7j5u91.jpg?width=921&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5894b6cd9a244fa0a9d0a8e1198590f47b23cbd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nhjagqv7j5u91.jpg?width=927&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0af4ab97b07238e1a859602e02bc1fa632575c7d", "author_fullname": "t2_8qj6m7n2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Need help identifying connector on the backplane", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 133, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"fg2uvov7j5u91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 103, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fg2uvov7j5u91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28ea4c26f415503f48de3e317de6f633e7687358"}, {"y": 206, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fg2uvov7j5u91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a06d8a38a02f1350accbece4b0a1150f2c08af7a"}, {"y": 306, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fg2uvov7j5u91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69966cec396c787b60d89724ab2d11aa9bd49581"}, {"y": 612, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fg2uvov7j5u91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca2e79d5e3dc3d1ac412f6652d4c48532711d54"}], "s": {"y": 881, "x": 921, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fg2uvov7j5u91.jpg?width=921&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5894b6cd9a244fa0a9d0a8e1198590f47b23cbd"}, "id": "fg2uvov7j5u91"}, "nhjagqv7j5u91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 95, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nhjagqv7j5u91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13fc092f0affc2484795a9f4700fe9f817d39637"}, {"y": 191, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nhjagqv7j5u91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f58cc703c8257df707036bbf4236311bd20cbaa0"}, {"y": 283, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nhjagqv7j5u91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c16688184eccdeffbf298302daa4006967d2570f"}, {"y": 566, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nhjagqv7j5u91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=166661900da2639a1d0845aafe582ac78aca40d4"}], "s": {"y": 821, "x": 927, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nhjagqv7j5u91.jpg?width=927&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0af4ab97b07238e1a859602e02bc1fa632575c7d"}, "id": "nhjagqv7j5u91"}}, "name": "t3_y4xzna", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4tIB66I5LHHBd9x8_94pDNiUoeu2meaJrPzPwqngCII.jpg", "edited": 1665919084.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1665866233.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in the process of building a storage server and have been checking out several casing options.
