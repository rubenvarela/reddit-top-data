New data comes in daily with a batch job and we use Athena for queries.\n\nWe got tired of this setup and decided to move to a more flexible data stack:Any EL tool (Fivetran, Airbyte, Hevo...) =&gt; Data warehouse =&gt; dbt =&gt; BI tool.\n\nMy current doubt regards the EL tool and how to move the existing data in S3 to a DWH. I was reading the docs of several of these EL tools and the first thing I noticed is that not all of them support parquet data, and those who do don't support HIVE partitioning.\n\nThe first step to me is quite clear: I can't use the data in the existing format, I have to copy it to another bucket and ditch the HIVE partitions at the very least.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure how to address everything else:\n\n* First of all, which EL tool would you recommend and why? Consider that I'd like to use the same tool to extract data from other sources too (mostly Saas)\n* How would you suggest I handle the currently existing data on S3? Should I keep parquet?
