However, I am now contemplating a masters or Ph.D........  It's one thing to know python/sci-kit learn and the conceptual basics of how ML/deep learning models work via a bootcamp/self-study, but it's another thing entirely to deeply know the intricacies of neural network architecture and how to do higher-level computer vision projects etc etc, if you catch my drift. I'm contemplating getting an MS CS or PhD with a focus on ML/AI (or maybe MS DS....) to maybe try to pivot more into ML Engineering or at least get a DS job with less analytics and more ML. I know I could try to pick up personal ML projects/ML projects at my current job but I'm not sure if it's sufficient enough to transition to where ML is the focus of my time.\n\nHas anyone had success from a BootCamp and still gone back to school anyway? Why/why not? Grad school is a lot of time and money, and because I'm already making a decent amount the ROI would only be the pursuit of my interests rather than monetary value/title. Have any BootCamp grads made the switch from DS to MLE? How did you do it? Are personal projects/self-study/MOOCs enough? \n\nI know a lot of the BootCamp vs grad school discourse has been beaten to death on this subreddit but I'm in need of a bit of guidance.

However, I am now contemplating a masters or Ph.D........  It&amp;#39;s one thing to know python/sci-kit learn and the conceptual basics of how ML/deep learning models work via a bootcamp/self-study, but it&amp;#39;s another thing entirely to deeply know the intricacies of neural network architecture and how to do higher-level computer vision projects etc etc, if you catch my drift. I&amp;#39;m contemplating getting an MS CS or PhD with a focus on ML/AI (or maybe MS DS....) to maybe try to pivot more into ML Engineering or at least get a DS job with less analytics and more ML. I know I could try to pick up personal ML projects/ML projects at my current job but I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s sufficient enough to transition to where ML is the focus of my time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had success from a BootCamp and still gone back to school anyway? Why/why not? Grad school is a lot of time and money, and because I&amp;#39;m already making a decent amount the ROI would only be the pursuit of my interests rather than monetary value/title.

I've seen people say 'all you need to know is a little bit of python and you can EASILY get a $150K+ data science job\".

There are some things I do enjoy about DS (visualizing data, especially) but overall I haven't really liked any of the data jobs I've had at all. I just feel like the long story short is every place I've worked has inconsistencies or uncertainties of what they're expecting from a 'data' person (which sometimes leads to a lot of pointless work) and that the people on the team also have variable skillsets (I've worked with a lot of people who don't know R or Python that made working on certain tasks challenging as I've had to do the heavy-lifting for places where coding was required). Maybe my issue is that I haven't yet worked on a DS team in tech, but I don't know if the issue is working outside of tech or maybe that data science isn't my primary forte as much as software engineering.\n\nI'm just concerned that by trying to switch to SWE, I'm going to have to work even harder with uncertainty if I'd get a good salary at this rate. Tbh, I feel really depressed when people talk about their $300K+ salaries or how they're even working TWO jobs with those kind of salaries whereas I don't even have one job breaking the $150K mark yet. My career hasn't really gone smoothly-in my last job I was supposed to get a promotion but it never came through due to logistical issues and I was the only data person on my team who knew how to program and saved our team thousands of hours of work because of it (the analysts previously were copying and pasting summary tables on Excel). The job I did prior to that one-my boss threatened to fire me only because I asked if he could hire a junior employee to do data entry rather than have me do it and screamed at me the reason he hired a 'masters level data' person was to do data entry (lol). I want to add that I'm a woman of color and look young, so people have treated me horribly in the workplace throughout my life. I'm so ready to get that 'amazing' job and feel I have what it takes, but unsure if I'm only going to prolong my chances at that if I make the switch to SWE with 5 years of data experience.

I know it is a very personal decision and of course, there are lot of factors that can affect the decision. So, I will give some context and some specific questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Not from the 'first world'. I am from Colombia, and that's an important point to be told. why? Because of the cost. A master, it is usually very expensive. But here, they are quite expensive in contrast with the average income. It is what it is, so, if I start a master, I will have to take a long-term credit to pay it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Not planning to stay in Colombia. I do not know when, how. But I will go out of LATAM. It is simple, I understand that I can get a good job here BUUUT still, not good enough compared with all the effort I\u2019m putting in this. I will never be equally well paid here, then; let\u2019s say, a 'a first world country'. If you are from LATAM, you'll understand what I\u2019m saying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Here, I am almost done with my Statistics career. True be told, I have learned a lot of statistics concepts BUT, in general; ML, Deep learning and so on, are terms that I have 'heard' about them but are not something that I had studied. Neither my academic 'career' (Degree. It is not the same here than in US, for example) or personal studies. So, ii have two options that are quite possible. \n\nI can enroll myself in a master and, somehow; there i will learn about... ML(?) Become a better candidate to a foreign company(?) I mean, i guess there is a potential that I\u2019m not seeing in taking a master... But I suppose that, if I\u2019m planning to live outside my country, i guess a master is an advantage. Not clear how. I\u2019m just guessing...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr... I can prepare myself with online courses such as, Coursera, Platzi and other online platforms where I can actually learn in a low-cost mode. I am thinking to take this path but, I lack a person who can actually guide me and give me a 'wise' advice. Is it correct to do this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, about my profile... As I said, I am enrolled in a University in Colombia, I am finishing my career (less than a year to graduate) and hopefully, I will get my studies done. What studies? Well, I have studies lot of mats and algebra concepts, statistics concepts; that why I could understand almost ay topic with linear algebra and, if I need it to; I could understand how to manipulate data, fit a model, predict, etc. etc. So, could be better my profile? Yes. That\u00b4s why I am asking.  How can i make it better?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, regarding my 'programming skills', I am R-Studio dependent. I know in some point I will have to learn python, SQL, AZURE, Etc. Let\u2019s say, I have 'the logic' to understand a language, but I haven\u2019t work with any other language. Plus, I feel very comfortable in R and not very fond with python. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what should I do? I would like to read some advice of some persons who actually have experience in the industry. What should I expect regarding my profile? Will it be better with a master or not? Should I be working instead, in learning on my own? Any useful advice? What to study?  Where to start?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPD: Obviously, English is not my first language.
