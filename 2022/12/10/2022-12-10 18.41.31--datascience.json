Then on my own, I figure out how to \"do\" it, and start coding. As I work, my code base gets more convoluted.\n\nTo address this, I've taken a software engineering 101 course on Udemy, and it was helpful for the \"planning\" phase. I.e. spend more time up front gathering requirements and turning them into specifications.

I'm wondering if you know of any good learning tools that would teach these things. I'm happy to take courses if available but haven't been able to find one.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Should I have a separate .py file where I define all of my functions, or should I define them in the script in which they will be used?\n2.

Is there a better way to create a project with all required packages so that anyone can run it without them needing Anaconda installed?\n5. Should I have a 'requirements.txt' file?

Want to get into tech (have tried in past without success), but considering switching to SWE because I enjoy developing more than the data work I've done so far. Unsure and looking for insight.**\n\nHey all,\n\nI've been working as a data professional for the past 5 years in academia and government after obtaining a masters degree in clinical research (strong stats skills).  I've seen people say 'all you need to know is a little bit of python and you can EASILY get a $150K+ data science job\". I don't know if that's people just exaggerating on the internet or that I'm truly behind (it does feel like my progression hasn't been as great as others at times). I have solid R and Python skills, 5 year progression has been $54K-&gt;$80-$93K-$120-130K-this is outside of tech, I tried to apply for a tech job last year and couldn't find one.\n\nI've made improvements to my Github, got an interactive dashboard published in a journal and completed a Python ML course since that time, but for the past year or so, I was already considering switching to SWE because I personally feel I enjoy developing more than deploying ML models-I've used both Python and R to develop things (I know R is not intrinsically a dev language) and a teeny bit of JS before I started seriously focusing on strengthening my dev skills over the course of the year. There are some things I do enjoy about DS (visualizing data, especially) but overall I haven't really liked any of the data jobs I've had at all. I just feel like the long story short is every place I've worked has inconsistencies or uncertainties of what they're expecting from a 'data' person (which sometimes leads to a lot of pointless work) and that the people on the team also have variable skillsets (I've worked with a lot of people who don't know R or Python that made working on certain tasks challenging as I've had to do the heavy-lifting for places where coding was required). Maybe my issue is that I haven't yet worked on a DS team in tech, but I don't know if the issue is working outside of tech or maybe that data science isn't my primary forte as much as software engineering.\n\nI'm just concerned that by trying to switch to SWE, I'm going to have to work even harder with uncertainty if I'd get a good salary at this rate. Tbh, I feel really depressed when people talk about their $300K+ salaries or how they're even working TWO jobs with those kind of salaries whereas I don't even have one job breaking the $150K mark yet. My career hasn't really gone smoothly-in my last job I was supposed to get a promotion but it never came through due to logistical issues and I was the only data person on my team who knew how to program and saved our team thousands of hours of work because of it (the analysts previously were copying and pasting summary tables on Excel). The job I did prior to that one-my boss threatened to fire me only because I asked if he could hire a junior employee to do data entry rather than have me do it and screamed at me the reason he hired a 'masters level data' person was to do data entry (lol). I want to add that I'm a woman of color and look young, so people have treated me horribly in the workplace throughout my life.

Want to get into tech (have tried in past without success), but considering switching to SWE because I enjoy developing more than the data work I&amp;#39;ve done so far. Unsure and looking for insight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working as a data professional for the past 5 years in academia and government after obtaining a masters degree in clinical research (strong stats skills).  I&amp;#39;ve seen people say &amp;#39;all you need to know is a little bit of python and you can EASILY get a $150K+ data science job&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s people just exaggerating on the internet or that I&amp;#39;m truly behind (it does feel like my progression hasn&amp;#39;t been as great as others at times). I have solid R and Python skills, 5 year progression has been $54K-&amp;gt;$80-$93K-$120-130K-this is outside of tech, I tried to apply for a tech job last year and couldn&amp;#39;t find one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made improvements to my Github, got an interactive dashboard published in a journal and completed a Python ML course since that time, but for the past year or so, I was already considering switching to SWE because I personally feel I enjoy developing more than deploying ML models-I&amp;#39;ve used both Python and R to develop things (I know R is not intrinsically a dev language) and a teeny bit of JS before I started seriously focusing on strengthening my dev skills over the course of the year. There are some things I do enjoy about DS (visualizing data, especially) but overall I haven&amp;#39;t really liked any of the data jobs I&amp;#39;ve had at all. I just feel like the long story short is every place I&amp;#39;ve worked has inconsistencies or uncertainties of what they&amp;#39;re expecting from a &amp;#39;data&amp;#39; person (which sometimes leads to a lot of pointless work) and that the people on the team also have variable skillsets (I&amp;#39;ve worked with a lot of people who don&amp;#39;t know R or Python that made working on certain tasks challenging as I&amp;#39;ve had to do the heavy-lifting for places where coding was required). Maybe my issue is that I haven&amp;#39;t yet worked on a DS team in tech, but I don&amp;#39;t know if the issue is working outside of tech or maybe that data science isn&amp;#39;t my primary forte as much as software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just concerned that by trying to switch to SWE, I&amp;#39;m going to have to work even harder with uncertainty if I&amp;#39;d get a good salary at this rate. Tbh, I feel really depressed when people talk about their $300K+ salaries or how they&amp;#39;re even working TWO jobs with those kind of salaries whereas I don&amp;#39;t even have one job breaking the $150K mark yet. My career hasn&amp;#39;t really gone smoothly-in my last job I was supposed to get a promotion but it never came through due to logistical issues and I was the only data person on my team who knew how to program and saved our team thousands of hours of work because of it (the analysts previously were copying and pasting summary tables on Excel). The job I did prior to that one-my boss threatened to fire me only because I asked if he could hire a junior employee to do data entry rather than have me do it and screamed at me the reason he hired a &amp;#39;masters level data&amp;#39; person was to do data entry (lol). I want to add that I&amp;#39;m a woman of color and look young, so people have treated me horribly in the workplace throughout my life. I&amp;#39;m so ready to get that &amp;#39;amazing&amp;#39; job and feel I have what it takes, but unsure if I&amp;#39;m only going to prolong my chances at that if I make the switch to SWE with 5 years of data experience.

Not clear how. I\u2019m just guessing...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr... I can prepare myself with online courses such as, Coursera, Platzi and other online platforms where I can actually learn in a low-cost mode.

As I said, I am enrolled in a University in Colombia, I am finishing my career (less than a year to graduate) and hopefully, I will get my studies done. What studies? Well, I have studies lot of mats and algebra concepts, statistics concepts; that why I could understand almost ay topic with linear algebra and, if I need it to; I could understand how to manipulate data, fit a model, predict, etc. etc. So, could be better my profile? Yes. That\u00b4s why I am asking.  How can i make it better?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, regarding my 'programming skills', I am R-Studio dependent.

I know it is a very personal decision and of course, there are lot of factors that can affect the decision. So, I will give some context and some specific questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Not from the &amp;#39;first world&amp;#39;. I am from Colombia, and that&amp;#39;s an important point to be told. why? Because of the cost. A master, it is usually very expensive. But here, they are quite expensive in contrast with the average income. It is what it is, so, if I start a master, I will have to take a long-term credit to pay it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Not planning to stay in Colombia. I do not know when, how. But I will go out of LATAM. It is simple, I understand that I can get a good job here BUUUT still, not good enough compared with all the effort I\u2019m putting in this. I will never be equally well paid here, then; let\u2019s say, a &amp;#39;a first world country&amp;#39;. If you are from LATAM, you&amp;#39;ll understand what I\u2019m saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Here, I am almost done with my Statistics career. True be told, I have learned a lot of statistics concepts BUT, in general; ML, Deep learning and so on, are terms that I have &amp;#39;heard&amp;#39; about them but are not something that I had studied. Neither my academic &amp;#39;career&amp;#39; (Degree. It is not the same here than in US, for example) or personal studies. So, ii have two options that are quite possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can enroll myself in a master and, somehow; there i will learn about... ML(?) Become a better candidate to a foreign company(?) I mean, i guess there is a potential that I\u2019m not seeing in taking a master... But I suppose that, if I\u2019m planning to live outside my country, i guess a master is an advantage. Not clear how. I\u2019m just guessing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or... I can prepare myself with online courses such as, Coursera, Platzi and other online platforms where I can actually learn in a low-cost mode. I am thinking to take this path but, I lack a person who can actually guide me and give me a &amp;#39;wise&amp;#39; advice. Is it correct to do this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, about my profile... As I said, I am enrolled in a University in Colombia, I am finishing my career (less than a year to graduate) and hopefully, I will get my studies done. What studies? Well, I have studies lot of mats and algebra concepts, statistics concepts; that why I could understand almost ay topic with linear algebra and, if I need it to; I could understand how to manipulate data, fit a model, predict, etc. etc. So, could be better my profile? Yes. That\u00b4s why I am asking.  How can i make it better?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, regarding my &amp;#39;programming skills&amp;#39;, I am R-Studio dependent. I know in some point I will have to learn python, SQL, AZURE, Etc. Let\u2019s say, I have &amp;#39;the logic&amp;#39; to understand a language, but I haven\u2019t work with any other language. Plus, I feel very comfortable in R and not very fond with python. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what should I do? I would like to read some advice of some persons who actually have experience in the industry. What should I expect regarding my profile? Will it be better with a master or not? Should I be working instead, in learning on my own? Any useful advice? What to study?  Where to start?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PD: Obviously, English is not my first language.
