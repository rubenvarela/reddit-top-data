I value my free time more than my paycheck. I'm looking to work part time full remote (just grind out 20 hours a week instead of working 40 hour corporate job). I have a couple years experience as a DS under my belt, mostly in DoD, which is not friendly to working remotely outside the US. So I'm thinking of maybe working for a consulting company or big tech consulting (AWS or azure) for a year to get experience, then jump into some type of 1099 contracting role with my own LLC that I would setup.\n\nWhat I'm thinking is to approach startup or smaller companies, who can't afford to hire a data scientist full time at $200k, but they still could leverage data expertise on a part time basis. From my job, I've realized the most data immature companies have the greatest marginal return, where they have some data management need that's tied to their bottom line. I would come in, help them setup a cloud environment, data management practices, ETL system, any type of algorithm if it's required, tie it to some relevant output (dashboards, reports, etc.), and then teach someone at the company how to operate it. (I've done this with analysts at my job) then I can return periodically to maintain the product for them. \n\nMy goal would be to work no more than 10-20 hours per week at $100/hr.

I write in hopes of getting some advice from some of you pros in regards which job offers i should accept. Mostly because the jobs seems to be in different \"clusters\" under the term Data Science. Its essentially a choice between:\n\n1. Traditional Data-analysis in a semi established data environment (data engineers, pyspark but no scrum/agile and generel IT workplace). Lots of data cleaning and exploratory analysis. Low pay, medium IT-skill.\n\n2. Data-analysis oriented towards Business Intelligence including automation/ETL, SQL, PowerBI and more socially interactive in conveying results and helping non-analyst coworkers. Not a well established data environment yet. Medium pay but higher potential, low-medium IT skill.\n\n3. Straight DS including working in a pro Agile/Scrum environment, mainly doing machine learning to find solutions to a multitude of services in the public county. Low pay, high IT skill. More specialized and not so generalized approach.\n\nAnd then without job offers but still relevant there the 4th path which is more SWE focused paths which includes more coding, having to either simple front end duties or learn about unit testing, data structures/algorithms and other languages but Python (C, java or the like). MLOps og MLE futures. Medium pay, high IT skill. Much for me to learn.\n\nSince i don't have any experience yet i'm not sure which direction i personally prefer. I think i'm best off just getting any experience. But already now the choice impacts my DS career by which job i accept. \n\nHowever the business job sounds good because i will learn basic ETL, automation, more like all-around IT skills, but i'm also afraid of it not being technically advanced enough and i'll be stuck as a dashboard and simple descriptive statistics monkey that will always be a business guy. Then theres the more \"IT solid\" jobs that has a better IT infrastructure already, more technical coworkers, agile procedures, but whats the future in this? I will just stand on what others have built perhaps and not advance in regards to social aspects or domain knowledge.\n\nSo i was wondering if you pros knows anything about these domains? Whats the most solid choice? What would you do if you just started out? I know its kinda hard to answer without knowing personal preferences but its still a choice to be made and any wisdom is appreciated!\n\nAlso if people is interested in hearing how i got good enough to land basic data analysis jobs just message me.
