Unfortunately I only got half way through before I had to stop due to a new job and some personal things that kept me occupied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now as I&amp;#39;m trying to go back, I find it that I have forgotten a lot of it. And I&amp;#39;ve noticed that this has happened a lot to me unfortunately. Because I don&amp;#39;t have a job that requires me to actually use anything I&amp;#39;ve learned, as soon as I stop getting exposures to it much, I begin to forget. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions on how to keep my knowledge up?

I started a new job a month ago, and one of the reasons they hired me is because they want to start working on the same type of thing. The companies are completely different and not competitors in any way.\n\nMy new team lead asked me to present on my previous experience on the topic, and I happily accepted since I would love to place myself as a subject expert and hopefully own the project in this new company. However, I'm preparing the presentation now and started to feel like maybe I'm revealing too much. I don't want people in my new job think I'm gonna go and spill the beans wherever I go next.\n\nAs context, what they want to implement is nothing secret. The approach we took in my previous place was following the implementation from a freely available paper. In my presentation I am basically discussing the paper -- I am using some examples based on what I did in my previous role, but I'm not revealing any details about the data or the results that we obtained with this in my previous company.\n\nWhat do you think? Does my approach sound good?
