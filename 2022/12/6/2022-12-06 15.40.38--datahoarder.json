Just want reliable, and secure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "zdreh4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "charliesfinger", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/zdreh4/how_to_setup_new_professional_photo_archives/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/zdreh4/how_to_setup_new_professional_photo_archives/", "subreddit_subscribers": 657753, "created_utc": 1670291305.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4686005\n\nSteve Digicams is no more, hoped someone manage to archive it", "author_fullname": "t2_4zbi4912", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Saw this post on DPreview and wanted to share it", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "news", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ze3op9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "News", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670324982.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4686005\"&gt;https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4686005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steve Digicams is no more, hoped someone manage to archive it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "ed4936de-4bf6-11e3-8e8d-12313d184137", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "ze3op9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VirtualEffort8", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/ze3op9/saw_this_post_on_dpreview_and_wanted_to_share_it/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ze3op9/saw_this_post_on_dpreview_and_wanted_to_share_it/", "subreddit_subscribers": 657753, "created_utc": 1670324982.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have had my unraid server out of commission for a while since the motherboard (**ASROCK C2750d4i**) died year ago.

It is very important to me to do a great job with the quality of those scans and all my extensive reading brings me to conclusion that destroying my very expensive magazines is the best way to go about it, because it provides a flat scan with minimum shadows and imperfections I can edit out afterwards. I settled on an Epson Perfection V600 scanner. Good, affordable, but fairly small considering how big vintage magazines used to be. But it seems like a good starting point. Any scanning tips from experienced photo scanners would be appreciated. \n\nHowever, that is not my main issue. I tried tearing apart my first magazine today and I don't know if I did it right. A lot of the articles mentioned guillotines and specific cutters for something like this, but considering that a lot of the advertisement and editorial images inside fashion magazines tend to be spread across two pages and I don't want any gaps in between them, it seems unwise to use a cutter to cut away the entire spine and most likely several milimeters of each page in the process. So I went and did it manually, page by page. I did it carefuly and very gently and I pulled out pages as close to the spine as it was possible, but the glue or whatever it is that binds the pages together left the edges of my tear sheets quite jagged and messy looking. Is that normal? Surely, I can edit that out in Photoshop, but I would love to know if there's a way of getting cleaner edges on the tear sheets without cutting off any of the picture.  I'm providing some images of my tear sheets. All help is greatly appreciated! \n\n[Detail](https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e5d4f7a8bf60bceec92972480d7a25d8c14614)\n\n[Double spread](https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893c459033e3f3542b543d14c3bbc2a710a9625a)", "author_fullname": "t2_5lqwu8u5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Scanning Tear Sheets from Magazines", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2ka40ua0c54a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 144, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f3a4a93aadb9f7f2f75d0339068ca067722195d"}, {"y": 288, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00c0852d120cabf6fe479d0de668689e4d3e19e7"}, {"y": 426, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0d734127d5425f2e65800b2793e28a753e616ab"}, {"y": 853, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5792bf8acbeb20e0f3f40bd0c93ac6ff14084a4d"}, {"y": 1280, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82f3de023a5f4d7d0c132c0cfd4da382b9dc9eaa"}, {"y": 1440, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c991d9855b02fc29cc7a25ec98fd3ece36938d9"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 1536, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2ka40ua0c54a1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e5d4f7a8bf60bceec92972480d7a25d8c14614"}, "id": "2ka40ua0c54a1"}, "rjguexa0c54a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 144, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45fd7b87d769e95ca789371b2fa427a52e2f190"}, {"y": 288, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01d4fbd2da8f1fbbac382c8955308b18a26c6cf0"}, {"y": 426, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9b7bcea8a3becbbb59b2209c1e9958f7bb5cd25"}, {"y": 853, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99833dd5f5c40fee81283b4ec004ea23ee3d2bb"}, {"y": 1280, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbb0c6f23dbb6dbb7154dd7d6ef669639d141406"}, {"y": 1440, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07ec0775d837da4721ebb86df140014fe278c5d4"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 1536, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rjguexa0c54a1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893c459033e3f3542b543d14c3bbc2a710a9625a"}, "id": "rjguexa0c54a1"}}, "name": "t3_zdk6pp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gLdmAFmPOxl38lZmq0JFtqBe78qha-JcubROMXvEmgI.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670275358.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read what feels like countless discussions on scanners and scanning processes to the point where it makes me slightly nauseous.

But do you guys recommend cloud saving, and if so what service? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second: File saving. I don\u2019t know much about computer files and compression or anything like that. I also have some files coming from Mac devices and don\u2019t know if it will be important for all files to be the same file type when all is said and done? Is this preferred, should i convert all my file types to a certain type like png or jpg or both? And should I keep these files compressed onto flash drives so you have to unzip them to view them or am I overthinking this portion? Any help would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "zdhvhz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "grantdotyea", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/zdhvhz/starter_questions_for_photo_cataloging/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/zdhvhz/starter_questions_for_photo_cataloging/", "subreddit_subscribers": 657753, "created_utc": 1670270700.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I am looking to build a NAS for myself.

This includes but is not limited to high res photographs of inside and out, around 100+ depending on size microscope images of the circuit boards stitched together into one large image, 4800dpi resolution scans of the stripped circuit boards, part lists, 3d scans of all plastic housings, circuit simulations and gerber files etc.\n\nI also intend on scanning game manuals, magazines and other paper formed media with the 4800dpi resolution. Due to wanting it as lossless and as high res as possible I'll be having the files stored as tiff which due to the resolutions I'm dealing with takes up space fast. A single page of a game manual is something like 2GB iirc.\n\nAs a result of all of this I need something that I can reliably store a very large amount of information on for an extremely long time without corruption. I've been looking into LTO very briefly and am considering it as a good option. I was considering DVDs but due to the sizes of some files it'd take a lot of them and would consume storage space. I have seen there are archival optical discs which may be suitable but I've not looked into it.\n\nDue to the fact I get the stuff as I go rewritable would be helpful for me. I don't really know how WORM works and I'm not sure if I'm stupid for having the thought in my head that if I didn't fully fill the medium in one go I'd have wasted space I couldn't populate, if I can keep adding to it until it is full though, I just can't modify or delete anything (other than adding to folders) I'd be fine with that.\n\nI've considered an SAS raid server but since I'm not going to be accessing stuff too much on the physical medium once I've finished documenting it I feel this isn't really an effective solution for the long term. I want to have multiple forms of backup and intend on having all my stuff online and accessible so it will be stored on an off site server as well.

Due to wanting it as lossless and as high res as possible I&amp;#39;ll be having the files stored as tiff which due to the resolutions I&amp;#39;m dealing with takes up space fast. A single page of a game manual is something like 2GB iirc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of all of this I need something that I can reliably store a very large amount of information on for an extremely long time without corruption. I&amp;#39;ve been looking into LTO very briefly and am considering it as a good option. I was considering DVDs but due to the sizes of some files it&amp;#39;d take a lot of them and would consume storage space. I have seen there are archival optical discs which may be suitable but I&amp;#39;ve not looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact I get the stuff as I go rewritable would be helpful for me. I don&amp;#39;t really know how WORM works and I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m stupid for having the thought in my head that if I didn&amp;#39;t fully fill the medium in one go I&amp;#39;d have wasted space I couldn&amp;#39;t populate, if I can keep adding to it until it is full though, I just can&amp;#39;t modify or delete anything (other than adding to folders) I&amp;#39;d be fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve considered an SAS raid server but since I&amp;#39;m not going to be accessing stuff too much on the physical medium once I&amp;#39;ve finished documenting it I feel this isn&amp;#39;t really an effective solution for the long term. I want to have multiple forms of backup and intend on having all my stuff online and accessible so it will be stored on an off site server as well.
