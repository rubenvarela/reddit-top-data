My manager wants me to find out a benchmark  of how to plan our paid marketing campaigns with Influencers on YouTube and Instagram.\n\nMy manager wants me tell him an **ideal number of followers and cost** we should we invest based on some historical data that we have. Example of data is below.\n\nI want to know creating a number/benchmark is even possible?\n\nI think this problem can be solved if we make a custom function and use our desired results as inputs and outputs should be Cost and Followers. But how to even approach that? \n\nAnd I know obv this can be solved through ML but have very little knowledge about that. Im pretty good at pandas though. If someone can guide me how to solve this would be really helpful.\n\nAny kind of help is really appreciated. Thanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=3023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21bf2daaae5add876e81478ac6084728922e8730", "author_fullname": "t2_cim5rbri", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Difficult business problem from my manager", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 15, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6rno8usk444a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 12, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6daebf7694e43722fa1d61be2a6ff017d7158e4"}, {"y": 24, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbc864ca5a19afc239e1f889aabb934b4f234c0e"}, {"y": 36, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=819589cbc7966012afb895f82ce3a9b51d9c31ea"}, {"y": 73, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d563bb533f485a06318daddc3b38ca240d980fe"}, {"y": 109, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd8db0ff7776bf6bb52b24e9cee911af967827a7"}, {"y": 123, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1028991d24497fa5b8ed839d6eaf7f62f266f293"}], "s": {"y": 345, "x": 3023, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6rno8usk444a1.png?width=3023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21bf2daaae5add876e81478ac6084728922e8730"}, "id": "6rno8usk444a1"}}, "name": "t3_zdd6ea", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bwvtYt4OVwZWwzaqGZM4h10zeu8toVmuOGZDq0L2ANQ.jpg", "edited": 1670268932.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1670261128.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work for a product based company as a data analyst.

The requirements that were put in front of me were:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must have a free version so that it can be tested&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must be able to run on our servers or to be deployed to the cloud&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If we decide to go for managed cloud it doesn&amp;#39;t need to be free&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must support Open Cypher query language&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve taken a look at &lt;a href=\"https://opencypher.org/projects/\"&gt;https://opencypher.org/projects/&lt;/a&gt; to see which databases support Open Cypher. It seems to me that half of those projects are dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have used any of the Cypher-based graph databases, can you tell me how did you decide on one?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there some that should be avoided? Are there any special pain points that you just needed to accept that were not solvable?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "92b74b58-aaca-11eb-b160-0e6181e3773f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "id": "zdysfr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zealousideal_Plan591", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/zdysfr/how_to_choose_the_right_graph_database/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/zdysfr/how_to_choose_the_right_graph_database/", "subreddit_subscribers": 82018, "created_utc": 1670310298.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1670310426.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/dataengineering/comments/zdysfr/how_to_choose_the_right_graph_database/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zdyu0v", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zealousideal_Plan591", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_zdysfr", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/zdyu0v/how_to_choose_the_right_graph_database/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/dataengineering/comments/zdysfr/how_to_choose_the_right_graph_database/", "subreddit_subscribers": 824114, "created_utc": 1670310426.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_t8fchab9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How good is data science in India?
