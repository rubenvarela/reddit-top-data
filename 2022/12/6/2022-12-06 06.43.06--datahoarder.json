I'm new to it. I'm buying a scanner in January and finally embarking on my long awaited scanning journey. I intend to digitze my collection of fashion magazines - and the most important aspect of them are the images, of course. It is very important to me to do a great job with the quality of those scans and all my extensive reading brings me to conclusion that destroying my very expensive magazines is the best way to go about it, because it provides a flat scan with minimum shadows and imperfections I can edit out afterwards. I settled on an Epson Perfection V600 scanner. Good, affordable, but fairly small considering how big vintage magazines used to be. But it seems like a good starting point. Any scanning tips from experienced photo scanners would be appreciated. \n\nHowever, that is not my main issue. I tried tearing apart my first magazine today and I don't know if I did it right. A lot of the articles mentioned guillotines and specific cutters for something like this, but considering that a lot of the advertisement and editorial images inside fashion magazines tend to be spread across two pages and I don't want any gaps in between them, it seems unwise to use a cutter to cut away the entire spine and most likely several milimeters of each page in the process. So I went and did it manually, page by page. I did it carefuly and very gently and I pulled out pages as close to the spine as it was possible, but the glue or whatever it is that binds the pages together left the edges of my tear sheets quite jagged and messy looking. Is that normal? Surely, I can edit that out in Photoshop, but I would love to know if there's a way of getting cleaner edges on the tear sheets without cutting off any of the picture.  I'm providing some images of my tear sheets.

I&amp;#39;m new to it. I&amp;#39;m buying a scanner in January and finally embarking on my long awaited scanning journey. I intend to digitze my collection of fashion magazines - and the most important aspect of them are the images, of course. It is very important to me to do a great job with the quality of those scans and all my extensive reading brings me to conclusion that destroying my very expensive magazines is the best way to go about it, because it provides a flat scan with minimum shadows and imperfections I can edit out afterwards. I settled on an Epson Perfection V600 scanner. Good, affordable, but fairly small considering how big vintage magazines used to be. But it seems like a good starting point. Any scanning tips from experienced photo scanners would be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, that is not my main issue. I tried tearing apart my first magazine today and I don&amp;#39;t know if I did it right. A lot of the articles mentioned guillotines and specific cutters for something like this, but considering that a lot of the advertisement and editorial images inside fashion magazines tend to be spread across two pages and I don&amp;#39;t want any gaps in between them, it seems unwise to use a cutter to cut away the entire spine and most likely several milimeters of each page in the process. So I went and did it manually, page by page. I did it carefuly and very gently and I pulled out pages as close to the spine as it was possible, but the glue or whatever it is that binds the pages together left the edges of my tear sheets quite jagged and messy looking. Is that normal? Surely, I can edit that out in Photoshop, but I would love to know if there&amp;#39;s a way of getting cleaner edges on the tear sheets without cutting off any of the picture.  I&amp;#39;m providing some images of my tear sheets.

I&amp;#39;ve looked into TrueNAS and Unraid, but both seem to have a pretty major drawback that makes them less than ideal for me; TrueNAS appears to be exceptionally difficult to add drives to after the fact, which means I&amp;#39;d need to buy vastly more HDDs all at once, and Unraid suffers from poor read performance due to its single-spool nature, which isn&amp;#39;t ideal for loading VMs off of. I still need to have this machine run the Plex server, as it&amp;#39;ll be the only chassis that can fit the GPU for hardware transcoding.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might just be misunderstanding the use-cases and features of these operating systems, and if so, please do inform me! What I&amp;#39;m really looking for is a storage-focused OS that makes it simple to manage and monitor traditional RAID, but I&amp;#39;m finding that surprisingly difficult to find!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wondering if any of you have experience with any solutions that might fit my needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "zdmfqf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "asphere8", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/zdmfqf/nas_oses_for_a_janky_use_case_unraidtruenasothers/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/zdmfqf/nas_oses_for_a_janky_use_case_unraidtruenasothers/", "subreddit_subscribers": 657693, "created_utc": 1670279818.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "In my country there's mostly Toshiba and WD.
