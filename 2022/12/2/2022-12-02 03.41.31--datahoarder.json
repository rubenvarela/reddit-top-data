As my data grew and I added larger HDDs to the system it seemed like a very cost efficient emergency plan.  The original plan (with 2TB drives) was to back them up using a \"toaster\" drive.  I'd keep a copy at work and a copy at the house and BackBlaze was the emergency plan.  The \"Toaster\" backup went out the window in 2018 when it began to take hours using \"eSata\" as the drives surpassed 10TB.\n\nSix months ago it dawn on me (one of those Duh? moments) that I now have 33TB of data on the Backblaze cloud from my six 20TB drives.  In the event of a catastrophic failure the only way Backblaze allows restoration is by downloading or a second option of  selling you a USB drive that they will fill with your data.  You can return up to 5 of these per year for credit.\\*  In short, a complete restoration would take a significant amount of time in 8TB chunks, between mailings.\n\nI have now purchased a Synology DS1821+, which despite what it says does support Seagate Iron Wolf 20TB drives (I currently have it configured using six with SHR-2 redundancy and 1 hot spare.  I'd still like to use a cloud backup but is Glacier any better at a large restoration than BackBlaze was?

Which is this thump every 5 seconds in idle:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksgOgrbRPOo\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksgOgrbRPOo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would bother me to no end, since my drives are bolt directly to the case and any vibration would be amplified. I don&amp;#39;t mind a bit more noise when the drive is working, but not this constant Chinese torture. So are there any drives that are 12TB+ and still suitable for a PC case? All the &amp;quot;consumer&amp;quot; HDDs only go up to about 4-6TB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choices would be:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;WD Red Plus/Pro or WD Ultrastar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Toshiba Enterprise MG08/MG09 or Toshiba N300&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seagate Exos X or Seagate Ironwolf&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So any of these comparable to my old WD Reds 6TB? Obviously them being 5400rpm they are a bit quieter, but I don&amp;#39;t think I would mind them being a bit louder when working, as long as they are quiet in idle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZtUBNbnrobtS5u5o44AoS5rThv6_bbQ0nx0Muqn8obk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f3b57194c26b19f0d95dd320f5e340e1c4010b89", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZtUBNbnrobtS5u5o44AoS5rThv6_bbQ0nx0Muqn8obk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=287d8d5adfb9017897e750d3e32adec2ad4cd72f", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZtUBNbnrobtS5u5o44AoS5rThv6_bbQ0nx0Muqn8obk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9f9eafc838bcd8e929b2874ba202baa114e1bb9", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZtUBNbnrobtS5u5o44AoS5rThv6_bbQ0nx0Muqn8obk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5a9580b3e3386e16831024b523199fc50b5d15", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "l49uNcRsklIzLwFsAaL3msrOd0XE0pISIZHg3SH1ugk"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "20c598d2-b3f5-11ea-8f7a-0e7cd54fad9b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "z9lvqy", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LeDucky", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 24, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/z9lvqy/are_there_any_larger_12tb_quiet_drives_without/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/z9lvqy/are_there_any_larger_12tb_quiet_drives_without/", "subreddit_subscribers": 657072, "created_utc": 1669895408.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hey hey\n\nI'm looking to scan a lot of documents, they come basically in three broad categories:\n\n* \"legal\"/financial documents like bills,\n* generally just interesting pictures for fun archival,\n* and more like fine art (my own drawings/paintings).\n\nAnyhow, i have an HP MFP scanner with ADF so getting them into digital shouldn't be much of a problem.
