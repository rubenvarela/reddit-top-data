null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hello everyone! I never thought I'd consider myself a data hoarder, but I've now made a habit of keeping everything I can get my hands on. I just built a new server that's...a bit overkill, but I'm excited to see what all I can do with it. Part of that process was adding two new drives to my array and with a good price on a 10 TB NAS drive, a third to add to my setup. I'm starting to get nervous about my ability for backups, would like to incorporate some redundancy/safeguards for what I currently have, and ask about recommendations for planning expansion. I guess I'll try to describe a little about my setup with needs and restrictions.\n\n**HARDWARE**\n\n* Local server (no remote access) running back-end processes, scraping, serving as a Pi-hole. On-board storage is a 500 GB Samsung EVO 970 Plus. Does not have mounts for 3.5\" HDD as it's a small form-factor former office computer that was donated to me and repurposed.\n\n* Remote-accessible server running media server, music service, Pi-hole, recipes website, Wireguard server. On-board storage is a 1 TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus. Has two 3.5\" bays and two 5.25\" bays converted to 3.5\". Support for RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10.\n\n* Raspberry Pi running OpenMediaVault attached to a self-powered USB 3.0 five-disk enclosure. The enclosure supports hardware RAID 0/1 on the first two disks. Currently running NFS for both local and remote-accessible servers.\n\n**STORAGE**\n\n* Two (2) WD Green WD30EZRX 3TB (salvaged/used, but pass SMART checks) | **Both 0% Full**\n\n* Two (2) HGST Deskstar 7K4000 4TB (salvaged/used, but pass SMART checks) | **40% Full + 2% Full**\n\n* One (1) Seagate Barracuda ST6000DM003 6TB (salvaged/used, but passes SMART checks) | **0% Full**\n\n* Two (2) WD Red Plus NAS WD80EFZZ 8 TB (new/barely used) | **RAID0 35% Full** (I'm sorry, I know...)\n\n* One (1) WD Red Plus NAS WD101EFBX 10 TB (new in package) | **Not Installed**\n\n* One (1) WD EasyStore **External USB 3.0** 264D 14 TB (two years old, frequent usage) | **48% Full**\n\nI get dinner-plate eyes when I see the sheer volume I could possible store, then the logical side of my brain kicks in and tells me to smarten up. Both servers run Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS and both need access to, essentially, all data stored on the drives that are not on-board storage. I don't use the on-board for much other than OS and serving some information for the front-end services (e.g., image cache for media server and recipes site).\n\nSo here's my primary question: how do I begin to figure out the best way to organize these drives in a way that makes sense? There are some choices that might be obvious to me, but don't make sense in the long run. First challenge is figuring out which drives to attach to which machines. \n\nThe next issue is how to back things up. I've been using borgbackup to handle home directories so at least my configs are safe and I can start again without having to re-do *all* of the work I've done so far. It's not perfect and I'm certainly not following 3-2-1, but I only started this project two or three years ago with zero knowledge around any of the services I currently run. I'd prefer to improve my backup and redundancy, iterate on it over time, and eventually achieve a more ideal approach rather than my current \"hope it keeps working and cry when it doesn't.\"\n\nSo I guess it's a) how to efficiently organize storage drives and b) best backup strategies for a beginner.

I never thought I&amp;#39;d consider myself a data hoarder, but I&amp;#39;ve now made a habit of keeping everything I can get my hands on. I just built a new server that&amp;#39;s...a bit overkill, but I&amp;#39;m excited to see what all I can do with it. Part of that process was adding two new drives to my array and with a good price on a 10 TB NAS drive, a third to add to my setup. I&amp;#39;m starting to get nervous about my ability for backups, would like to incorporate some redundancy/safeguards for what I currently have, and ask about recommendations for planning expansion. I guess I&amp;#39;ll try to describe a little about my setup with needs and restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARDWARE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local server (no remote access) running back-end processes, scraping, serving as a Pi-hole. On-board storage is a 500 GB Samsung EVO 970 Plus. Does not have mounts for 3.5&amp;quot; HDD as it&amp;#39;s a small form-factor former office computer that was donated to me and repurposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote-accessible server running media server, music service, Pi-hole, recipes website, Wireguard server. On-board storage is a 1 TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus. Has two 3.5&amp;quot; bays and two 5.25&amp;quot; bays converted to 3.5&amp;quot;. Support for RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi running OpenMediaVault attached to a self-powered USB 3.0 five-disk enclosure. The enclosure supports hardware RAID 0/1 on the first two disks. Currently running NFS for both local and remote-accessible servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two (2) WD Green WD30EZRX 3TB (salvaged/used, but pass SMART checks) | &lt;strong&gt;Both 0% Full&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two (2) HGST Deskstar 7K4000 4TB (salvaged/used, but pass SMART checks) | &lt;strong&gt;40% Full + 2% Full&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One (1) Seagate Barracuda ST6000DM003 6TB (salvaged/used, but passes SMART checks) | &lt;strong&gt;0% Full&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two (2) WD Red Plus NAS WD80EFZZ 8 TB (new/barely used) | &lt;strong&gt;RAID0 35% Full&lt;/strong&gt; (I&amp;#39;m sorry, I know...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One (1) WD Red Plus NAS WD101EFBX 10 TB (new in package) | &lt;strong&gt;Not Installed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One (1) WD EasyStore &lt;strong&gt;External USB 3.0&lt;/strong&gt; 264D 14 TB (two years old, frequent usage) | &lt;strong&gt;48% Full&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get dinner-plate eyes when I see the sheer volume I could possible store, then the logical side of my brain kicks in and tells me to smarten up. Both servers run Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS and both need access to, essentially, all data stored on the drives that are not on-board storage. I don&amp;#39;t use the on-board for much other than OS and serving some information for the front-end services (e.g., image cache for media server and recipes site).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s my primary question: how do I begin to figure out the best way to organize these drives in a way that makes sense? There are some choices that might be obvious to me, but don&amp;#39;t make sense in the long run. First challenge is figuring out which drives to attach to which machines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next issue is how to back things up. I&amp;#39;ve been using borgbackup to handle home directories so at least my configs are safe and I can start again without having to re-do &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the work I&amp;#39;ve done so far. It&amp;#39;s not perfect and I&amp;#39;m certainly not following 3-2-1, but I only started this project two or three years ago with zero knowledge around any of the services I currently run. I&amp;#39;d prefer to improve my backup and redundancy, iterate on it over time, and eventually achieve a more ideal approach rather than my current &amp;quot;hope it keeps working and cry when it doesn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess it&amp;#39;s a) how to efficiently organize storage drives and b) best backup strategies for a beginner.
