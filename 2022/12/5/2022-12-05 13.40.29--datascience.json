Overglorified Data Analysts\n\nI've worked as a data scientist at McKinsey, Facebook and Careem (Uber) and this role involved very very different job responsibilities at each company. I've come to the conclusion that \"data scientist\" is an unstable definition between companies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* At McK, my role involved 90% making slides, 10% making models.\n* At FB, my role involved 50% making dashboards and 50% making data pipelines.\n* At Uber I've finally converged on the job role building models, but there was nobody around to help push them to production\n\nHow do you even advertise your credentials on your CV? Is the role you're applying for looking for looking for type 1 2 or 3? Because the majority of what we did had a different title before data scientist started picking up rizz, and it was called \"data analyst\" and these poor souls make considerably less than what a \"data scientist\" does, A \u201cdata scientist\u201d is a luxury while a \u201cdata analyst\u201d on the other hand average take home is 30% less. So there\u2019s a shift in companies looking for cheaper labor by changing position tiles to more economical conditions.\n\nThe overall data science job market is down 15% year over year when you factor in analysts, ML engineers, and data based product managers. But data scientists are losing ground faster. We looked at job posting data over the last 18 months and noticed a 26% drop year over year from October 2021 to October 2022 in the number of data scientist job openings. Similarly, though, the number of data engineers and data analyst job openings rose. We saw this earlier in the year when a recruiting client of Interview Query\u2019s ended up downgrading their data science manager hire from a $200K salary role to just a $120K data analyst IC role.\n\nSo forging an entire personality around the idea of being a \"data scientist\" can make it very hard to market exactly WHAT you will be able to bring to the table when you decide to transition to a new role later on.\n\n2. Shitty Management\n\nData science is a discipline downstream from just about everyone including engineers, product managers, baristas and the guy that helps you renew your office access badge. As a data scientist, you'll find yourself doing less of the driving, and being driven a lot more driven (and not in the alpha bro 6am morning routine way).\n\nLet's talk a bit about shitty management. During the pandemic, the tech industry became the subject of FOMO and ridicule, people taking coding bootcamps started their own bootcamps promising 6 figure salaries to anyone who could import pandas and suddenly, the field became saturated with hope and magic. We frown upon hope in data science. I'm only kidding, but the number of absolutely terrible shitty and scientifically obtuse projects that were proposed, ney, forced down our throats became intractable.\n\nA lot of data scientists are tasked with trying to meet unrealistic KPI deadlines set by aloof nonchalant project managers who see you more as a \"sCiEnTisT\" stamp of approval as opposed to a colleague. It's akin to those 9/10 dentists colgate asks to recommend their toothpaste, because \"science\"  helps to sell the terrible idea you've been salivating over while looking at the potential bonus your coding underlings will deposit in your bloomingdales giftcard. Many times, denying them their precious \"science\" and revolting against them will ensure your newfound pariah status echo around the water cooler and your meets most gets pushed down to the unholy \"meet all\" instead. If you want that bonus, you better stop twisting theories to fit facts and start spinning facts to fit theories.\n\nNot all data science managers are tone-deaf when it comes to the old p-values, but many product managers brought in to help \"grow\" the business are great at talking the old talk but you'll be left dashboarding the dashboard and taking all the blame and none of the credit regarding the KPI shift on that all important north star metric we promised would enjoy exponential growth. I've seen project managers wake up fresh faced on a zoom call and shift the data scientist out of their own explanation of a dashboard they created with models they designed, because that person spent more time getting the science right than learning the buzzwords stakeholders want to hear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. The code sucks\n\nYour typical data scientist will write spend less time working on pull reviews and more time on the python notebooks and R sweaves. It's not because we don't want to, it's because in the majority of projects I've worked on, it's actively discouraged. You design dashboards, and maybe sometimes you model, but goddamn if you try to build infra you better get ready for that meatball sandwich. I used to LOVE working on infra and having some kind of authority over pushing changes to backend services or being direclty involved in the deployment chain. We just aren't rewarded for it because AGAIN, you can't dashboard a pull review and your all-important \"IMPACT\" won't be directly visible via your managers to the scrum master and beyond.\n\nTech companies are an incredible place to improve your coding skills because you're surrounded by engineers from the friendly and dark arts, all incredibly versed in algorithm design and the production lifecycle of a feature or patch updates. Unfortunately, these people are now your \"stakeholders\", and you'll be so caught up in moving that matplotlib legend 2 pixels to the right that you'll have difficulty shadowing or getting any kind of experience alongside them.\n\nFrustratingly, most data science interviews at the MAANG always incorporate some kind of coding interview sampled from leetcode's library of algorithms that we spend hours of g-fuelled lonely nights practicing over and over again. There is a 99.99% probability that you will never use any of them in your DS career, and the lack of practice means that naturally, these skills become rusty and when it comes time to transition to your next \"scientist\"  role, you'll end up repeating the aruduous revision process all over again.\n\nI know I sound like a grumpy grouchy old farty git but the truth is the truth, data science isn't robot arms playing chess on mars. My biggest advice is don't neglect the coding. Get DEEPER into data engineering, plug it hard and get the pull requests out there and polish up your coding skills. Jupyter notebook isn't e2e or full stack. If the hype train ever dies, and it looks like it is, you'll want to capitalise off of your other skills to continue to get those all important roles.", "author_fullname": "t2_7h1mi6us", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "DS since 2014 - 3 Reasons why Data Science Sucks -", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_zcfxv8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 42, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 42, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1670179477.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670175426.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I get that this post is long, tl;dr video version here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_6cuomwZzc&amp;amp;ab_channel=LeonChlon\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_6cuomwZzc&amp;amp;ab_channel=LeonChlon&lt;/a&gt; please feel free to drop a like/sub if you resonate with the message &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RANT STARTS HERE --&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Overglorified Data Analysts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked as a data scientist at McKinsey, Facebook and Careem (Uber) and this role involved very very different job responsibilities at each company.

I'm a data scientist with 3-4 years of experience.

I took the job because it paid me 100% more my previous job and is aligned with the specialization I have. Now I don't know what to feel. The company used to have a decent data team a few years ago but they laid off all of them and they're trying to build it up again. Since the last two weeks, I've been learning the ropes and reading up on the documentation of the code-freezed machine learning models of the company that was left by the last DS. \n\nWhen I was talking to the hiring manager, she said the company has data engineers and some business intelligence people. She even said there was another data scientist in the company already. I felt assured that they had some systems in place already. But to my surprise there's none of them. \n\nCareer wise I'd like to ask for your comments or suggestions. I'm aiming to transition to machine learning engineering and operations. Already have two years experience on the model development and six months operations part. Just need to find a way to transition into a full time career role focusing on it.

And the other two years was on small startups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my first time to join a company where I&amp;#39;m the only data scientist and there are no data engineers nor business intelligence people. I took the job because it paid me 100% more my previous job and is aligned with the specialization I have. Now I don&amp;#39;t know what to feel. The company used to have a decent data team a few years ago but they laid off all of them and they&amp;#39;re trying to build it up again. Since the last two weeks, I&amp;#39;ve been learning the ropes and reading up on the documentation of the code-freezed machine learning models of the company that was left by the last DS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was talking to the hiring manager, she said the company has data engineers and some business intelligence people. She even said there was another data scientist in the company already. I felt assured that they had some systems in place already. But to my surprise there&amp;#39;s none of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Career wise I&amp;#39;d like to ask for your comments or suggestions. I&amp;#39;m aiming to transition to machine learning engineering and operations. Already have two years experience on the model development and six months operations part. Just need to find a way to transition into a full time career role focusing on it. Unfortunately, AI startups are rare from where I&amp;#39;m from so there&amp;#39;s also the factor of opportunity availability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the best career move in this scenario?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zd33cg", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Massive-Cricket-7469", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/zd33cg/solo_ds_in_a_medium_sized_startup/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zd33cg/solo_ds_in_a_medium_sized_startup/", "subreddit_subscribers": 823855, "created_utc": 1670235346.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n[AI Query](https://aiquery.co) uses GPT-3 to help you write SQL queries using basic English prompts.
