Overglorified Data Analysts\n\nI've worked as a data scientist at McKinsey, Facebook and Careem (Uber) and this role involved very very different job responsibilities at each company. I've come to the conclusion that \"data scientist\" is an unstable definition between companies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* At McK, my role involved 90% making slides, 10% making models.\n* At FB, my role involved 50% making dashboards and 50% making data pipelines.\n* At Uber I've finally converged on the job role building models, but there was nobody around to help push them to production\n\nHow do you even advertise your credentials on your CV? Is the role you're applying for looking for looking for type 1 2 or 3? Because the majority of what we did had a different title before data scientist started picking up rizz, and it was called \"data analyst\" and these poor souls make considerably less than what a \"data scientist\" does, A \u201cdata scientist\u201d is a luxury while a \u201cdata analyst\u201d on the other hand average take home is 30% less. So there\u2019s a shift in companies looking for cheaper labor by changing position tiles to more economical conditions.\n\nThe overall data science job market is down 15% year over year when you factor in analysts, ML engineers, and data based product managers. But data scientists are losing ground faster. We looked at job posting data over the last 18 months and noticed a 26% drop year over year from October 2021 to October 2022 in the number of data scientist job openings. Similarly, though, the number of data engineers and data analyst job openings rose. We saw this earlier in the year when a recruiting client of Interview Query\u2019s ended up downgrading their data science manager hire from a $200K salary role to just a $120K data analyst IC role.\n\nSo forging an entire personality around the idea of being a \"data scientist\" can make it very hard to market exactly WHAT you will be able to bring to the table when you decide to transition to a new role later on.\n\n2. Shitty Management\n\nData science is a discipline downstream from just about everyone including engineers, product managers, baristas and the guy that helps you renew your office access badge. As a data scientist, you'll find yourself doing less of the driving, and being driven a lot more driven (and not in the alpha bro 6am morning routine way).\n\nLet's talk a bit about shitty management. During the pandemic, the tech industry became the subject of FOMO and ridicule, people taking coding bootcamps started their own bootcamps promising 6 figure salaries to anyone who could import pandas and suddenly, the field became saturated with hope and magic. We frown upon hope in data science. I'm only kidding, but the number of absolutely terrible shitty and scientifically obtuse projects that were proposed, ney, forced down our throats became intractable.\n\nA lot of data scientists are tasked with trying to meet unrealistic KPI deadlines set by aloof nonchalant project managers who see you more as a \"sCiEnTisT\" stamp of approval as opposed to a colleague. It's akin to those 9/10 dentists colgate asks to recommend their toothpaste, because \"science\"  helps to sell the terrible idea you've been salivating over while looking at the potential bonus your coding underlings will deposit in your bloomingdales giftcard. Many times, denying them their precious \"science\" and revolting against them will ensure your newfound pariah status echo around the water cooler and your meets most gets pushed down to the unholy \"meet all\" instead. If you want that bonus, you better stop twisting theories to fit facts and start spinning facts to fit theories.\n\nNot all data science managers are tone-deaf when it comes to the old p-values, but many product managers brought in to help \"grow\" the business are great at talking the old talk but you'll be left dashboarding the dashboard and taking all the blame and none of the credit regarding the KPI shift on that all important north star metric we promised would enjoy exponential growth. I've seen project managers wake up fresh faced on a zoom call and shift the data scientist out of their own explanation of a dashboard they created with models they designed, because that person spent more time getting the science right than learning the buzzwords stakeholders want to hear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. The code sucks\n\nYour typical data scientist will write spend less time working on pull reviews and more time on the python notebooks and R sweaves. It's not because we don't want to, it's because in the majority of projects I've worked on, it's actively discouraged. You design dashboards, and maybe sometimes you model, but goddamn if you try to build infra you better get ready for that meatball sandwich. I used to LOVE working on infra and having some kind of authority over pushing changes to backend services or being direclty involved in the deployment chain. We just aren't rewarded for it because AGAIN, you can't dashboard a pull review and your all-important \"IMPACT\" won't be directly visible via your managers to the scrum master and beyond.\n\nTech companies are an incredible place to improve your coding skills because you're surrounded by engineers from the friendly and dark arts, all incredibly versed in algorithm design and the production lifecycle of a feature or patch updates. Unfortunately, these people are now your \"stakeholders\", and you'll be so caught up in moving that matplotlib legend 2 pixels to the right that you'll have difficulty shadowing or getting any kind of experience alongside them.\n\nFrustratingly, most data science interviews at the MAANG always incorporate some kind of coding interview sampled from leetcode's library of algorithms that we spend hours of g-fuelled lonely nights practicing over and over again. There is a 99.99% probability that you will never use any of them in your DS career, and the lack of practice means that naturally, these skills become rusty and when it comes time to transition to your next \"scientist\"  role, you'll end up repeating the aruduous revision process all over again.\n\nI know I sound like a grumpy grouchy old farty git but the truth is the truth, data science isn't robot arms playing chess on mars. My biggest advice is don't neglect the coding. Get DEEPER into data engineering, plug it hard and get the pull requests out there and polish up your coding skills. Jupyter notebook isn't e2e or full stack. If the hype train ever dies, and it looks like it is, you'll want to capitalise off of your other skills to continue to get those all important roles.", "author_fullname": "t2_7h1mi6us", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "DS since 2014 - 3 Reasons why Data Science Sucks -", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_zcfxv8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1670179477.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670175426.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I get that this post is long, tl;dr video version here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_6cuomwZzc&amp;amp;ab_channel=LeonChlon\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_6cuomwZzc&amp;amp;ab_channel=LeonChlon&lt;/a&gt; please feel free to drop a like/sub if you resonate with the message &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RANT STARTS HERE --&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Overglorified Data Analysts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked as a data scientist at McKinsey, Facebook and Careem (Uber) and this role involved very very different job responsibilities at each company.

I can\u2019t imagine a world without it and don\u2019t think I should have to. \n\nWhen I was hired for my old management job, they did ask me to move down here, which I did. But from hire to now, I\u2019ve been in maybe 6-8 times. Every time I go in, it\u2019s crappy lightning, it\u2019s a ghost town, the employees in merch who are there look miserable.

Internally I only work with a data engineer, and our cadence over Slack is sufficient. My boss is not a fan of in-office at all. Her boss however is higher up and in constant talks about a back to office plan. He\u2019s more into it. \n\nWe had ou quarterly get together last month to plan 2023 and it was fun. I  never met any of these people and I think meeting someone can help streamline communication. But I have no desire to go back. I can\u2019t fathom it. The thought of going back keeps me up at night. For big get together where we plan the year out, I get it. There\u2019s value to that communication flow all in one place. But when it\u2019s just the three of us core employees in a depressing office, I don\u2019t see the point. But they keep talking about how the office is working on completely re-doing the floor with all the desks, how we\u2019re trying to have desks for everyone (we\u2019re about 20 short with all the new Covid hires), etc. It\u2019s stressing me out. It\u2019s a cockroach in my head.\n\nMy boss\u2019 boss asked me how I felt about remote vs if there\u2019s value going in, and my anxiety made me sound more excited than I am going into work. Plus I don\u2019t want to tell a higher up that I hate it and don\u2019t see the point. I basically said I think it\u2019s valuable to meet people and what not, and there could be advantages. Idiot. My direct boss jumped in and said it makes sense for big get togethers, but not just us three. I\u2019ve told her before I won\u2019t come in unless I\u2019m told to (which she\u2019s fine with). She\u2019s offered a desk prior to me and I\u2019ve declined. As of now, the office is open - with some teams demanding more time than others. 2023 seems to be their big attempt though. \n\nI love to work. I love my job. I work at 3am I work at 11am.

If I meet my deadlines and get good feedback and increase adoption - who cares?\n\nI wish I could communicate my disdain more openly like that. I feel bad I sounded more eager about the office in that one call than I ever have to my direct report. I think it\u2019ll still be hybrid-ish, but even a few days a week is a lot. It\u2019s a crappy commute, I have a dog I need to pay $40 a day for daycare, I can\u2019t focus, a lot of anxiety and dread Carries with me. And again, my job doesn\u2019t need it. I primarily dashboard. I\u2019m not selling things or in big client meetings. I just don\u2019t get it. \n\nI wish I could reset and talk to my boss about it again.

There are offices in the states I\u2019m interested in, but with them talking about how jazzed they are to have everyone here, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m trapped.
