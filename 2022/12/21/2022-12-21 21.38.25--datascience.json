I&amp;#39;m a PM at a human data startup (Surge AI) that helps LLM and search companies train and evaluate their models on human feedback, so I ran an analysis of ChatGPT on 500 search queries: &lt;a href=\"https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/googles-existential-threat-chatgpt-matches-googles-performance-on-informational-search-queries-and-smashes-it-on-coding\"&gt;https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/googles-existential-threat-chatgpt-matches-googles-performance-on-informational-search-queries-and-smashes-it-on-coding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously ChatGPT is slow, expensive, and needs a lot of improvements before it\u2019s a serious Google contender \u2013 *right now!* But it\u2019s fascinating to see just how good it is out of the box, and to think about what this means once this tech gets into more people\u2019s hands...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jSjZnr8p11InWxjQRe4BSzhcUNXV8BoBlnHiESOS9vM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0b218fb677979288a2060e17990bf12874764db5", "width": 1436, "height": 1426}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jSjZnr8p11InWxjQRe4BSzhcUNXV8BoBlnHiESOS9vM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d45b6c9c270372c26cbe4601d34e16350d60836", "width": 108, "height": 107}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jSjZnr8p11InWxjQRe4BSzhcUNXV8BoBlnHiESOS9vM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a49b8ca1e48a54e259f85bcbbd87c8458738a1ac", "width": 216, "height": 214}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jSjZnr8p11InWxjQRe4BSzhcUNXV8BoBlnHiESOS9vM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c5a92402388b069fb3ce505e599a4028e10f942", "width": 320, "height": 317}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jSjZnr8p11InWxjQRe4BSzhcUNXV8BoBlnHiESOS9vM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b45298f7311263e3bf46c40631f9954b471b74bd", "width": 640, "height": 635}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jSjZnr8p11InWxjQRe4BSzhcUNXV8BoBlnHiESOS9vM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d41517c3b10e38eda2a1a7276cf90dd1ffea98", "width": 960, "height": 953}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jSjZnr8p11InWxjQRe4BSzhcUNXV8BoBlnHiESOS9vM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3d0aaff72a2f699c411e3fb985302d7e80c141", "width": 1080, "height": 1072}], "variants": {}, "id": "vxTT4wjeojlZU7RNc6BLPgDrA3F3ji3mGRkAz6teMtQ"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zryn8s", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "maximumpineapple27", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/zryn8s/measuring_chatgpt_vs_google_on_500_search_queries/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zryn8s/measuring_chatgpt_vs_google_on_500_search_queries/", "subreddit_subscribers": 829062, "created_utc": 1671651769.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Year ago I saw a web-based tool, it might have even been in Flash, that let you search for an executive board member, see everyone on that board, then build out a network map by clicking through their names.  \nDoes anyone remember it?

I'm early into my career, but I'm trying to figure out how to go forward from here.  A little bit of background. I have a BS &amp; MS in essentially information/computer science (not quite as theory/math heavy as CS, more application focused, but I digress), with emphasis in machine learning/AI for business problems. Basically, my knowledge might be more in line with advanced analytics (applying  existing models to new business domains) vs 'data science' (researching/making novel models), although I'm open and willing to be in the math heavy research side if the opportunity presents itself.   \n\n\nMy first work experience was as a data science intern on an internal consulting team were I was helping to build models and solve problems using data from various other teams in the business (where I was hoping to be with my current job). I was there for a year before leaving to try something on the business side of things (big mistake, hated that).  This is the type of work I enjoy doing the most.  \n\n\nFast forward a couple internships and I'm at my current job. I've been here for a couple years now (first full time position) as a 'data scientist'. I was here originally as an intern but converted. The original intention of the team, and my role, was to do data science/ML work in the traditional sense. Unfortunately, me and the other data scientists don't do DS work. My role has essentially transformed into a data engineering role, where I handle ETL pipelines for the reports that the BI folks on the team do. This isn't to say that I don't find value in my work and I do use related skills, like SQL. I don't hate it. But, it's frustrating that the one ML project proposal we've come up with keeps getting pushed back.. The 'promise' that was made a couple years ago just isn't happening, and it's impacting my motivation a lot. I think its time to move on.  \n\n\nBut here's my problem. I'm worried that my skillset has moved away from the type of work I want to be doing. I worry that I've locked myself into a data engineering career. This wouldn't be a bad thing if  I was an engineer working directly with ML pipelines. Then I would at least have some exposure. Even though my title and job description *is* that of a 'traditional' data scientist, I have no recent projects to speak on.  My resume isn't as impressive it should be for a data scientist 4 years into their career (counting internships).   \n\n\nWhat should I do? I'm scared that the transition back to more explicit DS work will come with a pay cut (going from mid-level position back to entry-level), because  I have no recent projects. My core skills (Python, R, etc.) are weaker than they should be from not using them as much. My initial plan is to retouch on those skills and poke around on Kaggle, even the toy datasets, to show something. Otherwise, I've considered trying to get an IBM or Google DS certificate, but this feels like a waste considering I have a master's degree and grad certification in ML/AI.

Which is weird and invasive and makes me self-conscious about the tinkering stage but without being able to do anything about it for now I am worried that no matter that I make the deadlines or am engaged in all other areas, it does leave the impression that I am not working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it would be nice to influence some changes in the future, given it is the holidays I am new and all that-- any thoughts on whether it is that big of a deal and if I should continue using my personal computer to connect and do my work?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zryto3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CleanDataDirtyMind", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/zryto3/conundrum_keep_using_faster_computer_or_support/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zryto3/conundrum_keep_using_faster_computer_or_support/", "subreddit_subscribers": 829062, "created_utc": 1671652171.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": " \n\nAlright,\n\nFirst off: my formation covers:\n\nQUANTITATIVE:\n\n* Statistics and probabilities  \n\n   * (up through inferentiel statistics, but not linear algebra)\n* Quantitative methodologies (social questions) (though sometimes descrete economic data used)\n* Quantitative epistomologies\n* S/S (using statistical and probabablistic formulas)\n* R\n* PYTHON\n\nQUALITATIVE:\n\n* Survey methodology (construction, treatment, analysis)\n* Qualitative study methods (observational, quantitative (nominal and ordinal questions), interviews)\n\nTHEORETICAL / OTHER:\n\n* Philosophical considerations for situation and treatment of social question: through  \n\n   * Ontology\n   * Epistimology\n   * Methodology\n   * and \"echelle\" Macro/ Meso/ Micro social questions and phenomena.\n* Broad formation in verious theories, hypotheses, as well as influential movements and thinkers in Sociology.\n* Specific courses following 'fields of research': Power, Politics, Media, Social Networks \"systemes numeriques\", Healthcare systems (global), Judiciary/ legal systems (global), Migration (global), Stratification/ class systems (global).
