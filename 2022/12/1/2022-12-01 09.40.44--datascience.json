currently working as a Data Analyst (UK based) in industry, in a completely different field/subject to what I did at university (I studied Physics, then completed my PhD in Physics looking at spacecraft data). This is my first full time job and I\u2019ve only been in it for about 10 months.\n\nBecause of this, you could say I have no \u201cformal\u201d training as a data analyst/scientist, but that\u2019s fine because I\u2019ve got plenty of experience and a quantitative background.\n\nNow, in my industry, I work with a range of datasets associated with different topics and subject areas. Because of this, despite me having the transferable technical skills to be able to break down and analyse the data, and communicate with stakeholders, my knowledge of the subjects themselves is quite weak compared to the people I provide the analysis for (the \u201csubject matter experts\u201d), because I\u2019m constantly dipping in and out of different projects and datasets.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s what I\u2019m in for in my career as a data analyst/scientist?
