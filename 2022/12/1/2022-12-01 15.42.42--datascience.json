Using sklearn's GaussianNB model resulted in a rediculously high error rate, in part due to my data being highly imbalanced, so I did a bunch of Googling about how to deal with imbalanced data in particular with regards to Naive Bayes' and I came across an article mentioning sklearn's ComplementNB function being specifically intended for imbalanced data.  Looking at the function documentation, it said the same thing.  And when I tried using it on my data, sure enough, the error rate decreased significantly.  What I don't understand is _why_.  \n\nIf I understand correctly, the way normal Naive Bayes' works is to assume a prior probability distribution (e.g., the normal distribution), then compute all the likelihoods, plug into Bayes' theorem to get the probability of each data value belonging to each class, and assign each value to the data set it has the highest probability of belonging to.  \n\nFrom what I've read about the complement version, it sounds like we instead compute the likelihood that the value _doesn't_ belong to each class.  I'm not entirely clear on whether we then plug each likelihood into Bayes' formula and compute the probability of each data point not belonging to the given class, and then choose the class with the smallest probability, or if we just pick the class with the smallest likelihood.  I'm assuming the former, but the explanations I found were a bit vague.  \n\nEither way though, while it makes intuitive sense to choose the class the value has the smallest chance of NOT being in (or, alternatively, the class with the smallest likelihood), I don't see why that method should perform any better on imbalanced data than the standard algorithm.  Indeed, if we are actually computing the probability, rather then the likelihood, it seems like it should be mathematically equivalent to the standard version.  If we're just using the likelihood I can see why it's different, but now why it should tend do better on imbalanced data than the the standard method.\n\nThe thought that comes to mind is that perhaps it's not making the \"naive\" assumption of the predictor variables all being independent of each other, and I can see how this assumption would be more problamatic with highly imbalanced data.  In particular, I know the reason for the assumption of independence in the first place is that it greatly reduces the amount of calculation and I also know that it's sometimes involves less calculation to compute 1-p(not(x)) than to directly compute p(x), which could, in some cases, perhaps reduce the computational complexity involved in dropling the assumption of independence.

Using sklearn&amp;#39;s GaussianNB model resulted in a rediculously high error rate, in part due to my data being highly imbalanced, so I did a bunch of Googling about how to deal with imbalanced data in particular with regards to Naive Bayes&amp;#39; and I came across an article mentioning sklearn&amp;#39;s ComplementNB function being specifically intended for imbalanced data.  Looking at the function documentation, it said the same thing.  And when I tried using it on my data, sure enough, the error rate decreased significantly.  What I don&amp;#39;t understand is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I understand correctly, the way normal Naive Bayes&amp;#39; works is to assume a prior probability distribution (e.g., the normal distribution), then compute all the likelihoods, plug into Bayes&amp;#39; theorem to get the probability of each data value belonging to each class, and assign each value to the data set it has the highest probability of belonging to.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I&amp;#39;ve read about the complement version, it sounds like we instead compute the likelihood that the value &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; belong to each class.  I&amp;#39;m not entirely clear on whether we then plug each likelihood into Bayes&amp;#39; formula and compute the probability of each data point not belonging to the given class, and then choose the class with the smallest probability, or if we just pick the class with the smallest likelihood.  I&amp;#39;m assuming the former, but the explanations I found were a bit vague.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way though, while it makes intuitive sense to choose the class the value has the smallest chance of NOT being in (or, alternatively, the class with the smallest likelihood), I don&amp;#39;t see why that method should perform any better on imbalanced data than the standard algorithm.  Indeed, if we are actually computing the probability, rather then the likelihood, it seems like it should be mathematically equivalent to the standard version.  If we&amp;#39;re just using the likelihood I can see why it&amp;#39;s different, but now why it should tend do better on imbalanced data than the the standard method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thought that comes to mind is that perhaps it&amp;#39;s not making the &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot; assumption of the predictor variables all being independent of each other, and I can see how this assumption would be more problamatic with highly imbalanced data.  In particular, I know the reason for the assumption of independence in the first place is that it greatly reduces the amount of calculation and I also know that it&amp;#39;s sometimes involves less calculation to compute 1-p(not(x)) than to directly compute p(x), which could, in some cases, perhaps reduce the computational complexity involved in dropling the assumption of independence.  But if that&amp;#39;s the case then, 1. why is it stilled called Naive Bayes&amp;#39;, and 2. wouldn&amp;#39;t it sometimes actually make the computational complexity higher?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "z99234", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dcfan105", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/z99234/why_is_the_complement_version_of_naive_bayes/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/z99234/why_is_the_complement_version_of_naive_bayes/", "subreddit_subscribers": 822912, "created_utc": 1669855690.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I'm recruiting for a junior position, and I keep seeing candidates list ML everywhere along with their master's degree - however, their ML projects include using regression/ARIMA to forecast the stock market/crypto.
