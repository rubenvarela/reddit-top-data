So, for getting both things, I can think of two different approaches:\n\n**1. Sync + File system snapshots:** Using rclone to perform a daily sync of the data on my PC to the cloud storage (one way sync) and use the snapshot feature of the cloud storage's file system to have file versioning.  \n**2. Incremental backups with backup software:** Using a backup software like Veeam to upload daily incremental backups of my data to the cloud storage.\n\nComparing the two, I see the following pros and cons for each method:\n\n**1\\. Pros:**  \n\\+ I would not depend on a specific software for restoration as the data would be stored on it's original form on the cloud storage.  \n**1\\. Cons:**  \n\\- The snapshots take up more storage space? (not sure about that)  \n\\- I would be limited to the maximum number of snapshots allowed on the cloud storage (20 snapshots for 5TB plan in Hetzner Storage Box)  \n\\- I would be missing encryption and compression features on the backup\n\n**2\\. Pros:**  \n\\+ More efficient storage of backups (compression) and encryption features  \n\\+ Unlimited history of versions  \n**2\\. Cons:**  \n\\- To depend on a specific backup software for restoring the files\n\nComparing both of them, I feel more inclined to method number 1. just for avoiding the vendor lock-in. What are your thoughts on this? Is any of the options better from a security standpoint?

So, for getting both things, I can think of two different approaches:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sync + File system snapshots:&lt;/strong&gt; Using rclone to perform a daily sync of the data on my PC to the cloud storage (one way sync) and use the snapshot feature of the cloud storage&amp;#39;s file system to have file versioning.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2.

(not sure about that)&lt;br/&gt;\n- I would be limited to the maximum number of snapshots allowed on the cloud storage (20 snapshots for 5TB plan in Hetzner Storage Box)&lt;br/&gt;\n- I would be missing encryption and compression features on the backup&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.
