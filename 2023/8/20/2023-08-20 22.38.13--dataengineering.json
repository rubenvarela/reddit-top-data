Feel free to pick this apart. \n\nWe're migrating from on prem SQL Server to cloud based, but the solution seems eh. \n\nThe cloud setup that's been built mostly, but is still a work in progress: \n\n**Part 1:**\n\n  * Our ERP (Dynamics FO) exports near real-time data to .csv files in Azure Data Lake Gen 2, using its built in connector\n   * This includes actual tables, plus Views that create somewhat denormalized entities (the entities being what we're accustomed to working with)\n\n  * Our remaning on prem stuff, exports nightly to Parquet files, in Azure Data Lake Gen 2. \n\nPart 1 seems to work OK.  But part 2, seems a bit sketchy. \n\n**Part 2:** \n\n  * Spark Notebooks, running (mostly) Spark SQL, take the data from the two above sources, and combine it into facts, dims, snap tables, etc. \n\n  * External tables are registered, which we then query via Synapse Serverless. \n\n**Issues:** \n\n  * Synapse serverless seems to have poor &amp; unpredictable performance\n  * Our ERP entities are now views (poor performance)\n  * Transformations are done in Spark SQL, which is a learning curve compared to our in house expertise (T-SQL).  It also seems finnicky, compared to say traditional SQL, which is rock solid. But maybe that's just do to relative ignorance. \n  * This 'datawarehouse' lacks tons of features of a traditional data warehouse.  That would be a pretty big sublist. \n \n----------------------\nI'm wonder about keeping Part 1, and \n\n**Alternative Part 2:**\n \n\n  * Data Factory to run those ERP entity views, and create actual tables for them - over in Azure SQL\n  * Data factory to pull over copies of everything else from the data lake, over to staging schema in Azure SQL \n  * Use Stored procs to create the facts, dims, etc. - some advantage, is that that's how our current on prem solution works. Just re-use those stored procs, using still T-SQL\n\nThat said, we've just sunk a lot of money into the current not-quite-ready setup, there's Fabric, whatever that has, and again - I'm not a data engineer. \n\nThoughts?", "author_fullname": "t2_3bc49", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How does this architectore from ADL2 --&gt; A datawarehouse, sound?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_15vvujs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1692489930.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1692489718.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a data engineer.
