We are currently looking for a Data Analyst for our Data area with experience in Power Bi\". It is worth noting that I am currently doing an internship in which I only do metrics and visualizations in Power Bi, I don't do anything else.\n\nCan't someone from Data Science apply for data analysis roles?

I'm seeking some career advice, and I'd appreciate your input on my situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give you a quick overview of my background, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science in India. During my academic journey, I managed to gain some valuable experience through a couple of internships\u2014one in sales analytics and another in machine learning within the logistics industry. Additionally, I undertook two research projects focused on computer vision applied to geo data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, during my summer break, I was fortunate to secure a Data Science internship at a Venture Capital Firm.

Sorry if there's any specific posting/formatting rules I'm not following! The post might be a little bit long, but I will try to make it short \n\n**Background**: \n\nI'm a recent BS grad from an R1 research state school in Washington (UW lol) and when I went in, I initially thought I'd be into med school and then half way I switched tracks to pharmaceutical research because I was interested in drug development. So during my 3 years there (1.5yrs of remote/pandemic learning), I did medicinal research for 2 years, doing antibiotics or drug discovery, involving a lot of physical laboratory work, like what you would see in a traditional biochem/biology lab. Which I think is fun and I'm really good at what I do, but I happened to pick up CS during my summer internship making cancer drugs and I found it really interesting. I started taking programming courses in my senior year, it was really too late to switch majors at that point.\n\nI didn't really get to pick up any internships from tech companies or industry because I came to the university already with 2 years of courses completed at a CC (I skipped 2yrs of high school) and my first 1.5 years at the university was during the pandemic/lockdown. So I really only had 1 summer available for an internship.\n\n**The main concern**:\n\nI learned Python, R, and a bit of SQL, and became really good at Tableau dashboards (making those are so fun lol) both during my research and from classroom courses. I've done several projects in Python and R and I also picked up a bit of machine learning but nothing like NLP and only applied LLM but didn't write code for it. I decided I want to pivot towards something like data science and eventually ML researcher or engineer later. I've been applying to places with roles like data scientists and data analysts and I've been having difficulties getting callbacks, probably 3 from the 150 I submitted. I'm definitely thinking about getting an MS or Ph.D, either in statistics or data science. \n\n**Question**:\n\nAm I underqualified for roles in tech because of my research background?

Here&amp;#39;s an outline of my data preprocessing steps:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def tokenize_and_lemmatize(text):\n    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;\n    This function tokenizes and lemmatizes the provided text. \n    It also filters out stop words and non-alphabetical tokens.\n    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    cleaned_text = &amp;#39; &amp;#39;.join([token.lemma_.lower()  \n              for token in doc      \n              if not token.is_stop and token.is_alpha])  \n    return cleaned_text  \n\nemotions_data[&amp;#39;clean_text&amp;#39;] = emotions_data[&amp;#39;text&amp;#39;].apply(tokenize_and_lemmatize)\n\ncolumns_to_drop = [&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;author&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;subreddit&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;link_id&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;parent_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;created_utc&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;rater_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;example_very_unclear&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;text&amp;#39;]\nemotions_data.drop(columns_to_drop, axis=1, inplace=True)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After preprocessing, my dataset structure looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| | admiration | amusement | anger | annoyance | approval | caring | confusion | curiosity | desire | disappointment | ... | nervousness | optimism | pride | realization | relief | remorse | sadness | surprise | neutral | clean_text |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;|---|------------|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------------|-----|-------------|----------|-------|-------------|-------|---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | game hurt |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | group category make different other ... |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | right care |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m feeding this data into a RoBERTa model, fine-tuned for emotion recognition (&amp;quot;EmoRoBERTa&amp;quot;). Here&amp;#39;s the code block for my model setup and training:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Extract the input text and emotion labels\ntexts = emotions_data[&amp;#39;clean_text&amp;#39;].values\nemotions = emotions_data.drop(columns=[&amp;#39;clean_text&amp;#39;]).values\n\n# Ensure emotion labels are in the form of numpy arrays\nemotions = np.array(emotions, dtype=&amp;#39;int32&amp;#39;)\n\n# Perform train-test split\ntrain_texts, test_texts, train_emotions, test_emotions = train_test_split(\n    texts, emotions, test_size=0.2, random_state=42\n)\n\n# Load the EmoRoBERTa tokenizer\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(&amp;quot;arpanghoshal/EmoRoBERTa&amp;quot;)\n\n# Tokenize the train and test data\ntrain_tokenized_data = tokenizer(list(train_texts), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=50)\ntest_tokenized_data = tokenizer(list(test_texts), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=50)\n\n# Create TensorFlow datasets from tokenized data\nbatch_size = 16\ntrain_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((\n    dict(train_tokenized_data),\n    train_emotions\n)).shuffle(len(train_texts)).batch(batch_size)\n\ntest_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((\n    dict(test_tokenized_data),\n    test_emotions\n)).batch(batch_size)\n\n# Load the pre-trained RoBERTa model for sequence classification\nmodel = TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(&amp;quot;arpanghoshal/EmoRoBERTa&amp;quot;)\n\n# Compile the model with optimizer, loss, and metric\noptimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-5)\nloss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\nmetrics = [&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]\nmodel.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)\n# Train the model\nhistory = model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10, validation_data=test_dataset)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite my steps to preprocess, clean the data, and fine-tune the model, I need help to improve my classification results. I&amp;#39;ve attempted several things and need help getting everything working. Despite these efforts, I&amp;#39;m still awaiting the improvements I&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate your insights or suggestions if anyone has experience with the GoEmotion dataset, similar emotion classification tasks, or working with Transformer models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,
