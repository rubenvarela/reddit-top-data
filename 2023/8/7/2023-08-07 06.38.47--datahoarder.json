That should cover most questions.\n\nI am not an expert by any means; I don't have any AWS certificates and I'm not a grizzled old sysadmin whos been in the business for 30 years. But I've been around long enough to see shit happen and I think I know just enough about this to start the conversation going.\n\nI've noticed a lot more people asking about Deep Archive and most of them seem to be under the impression they can just swap out google drive / dropbox unlimited tier with it... And if you're one of those people, please refer to the TLDR. And also if you're one of the ones suggesting random, uninitiated who have absolutely no idea what they're doing use it, please stop.\n\nDeep Archive is very very cold storage meant for archival use. If you don't know what any of that means, refer to the TLDR. \n\nThis means that it's cheap, very cheap in fact. On a pure $/TB basis it is probably the cheapest storage available at around $1/TB per month which is about 5 times cheaper than other services like Wasabi, Storj... And AWS's own storage services...? That's right, Amazon has more than 1 storage product and business / users who literally spend millions of dollars on AWS aren't complete idiots for paying upwards of 20x for the same amount of capacity. If this is somehow surprising to you, refer to the TLDR.\n\nIf you want to interject with 'But company X, Y or Z has unlimited storage for a fixed cost!', please refer to the TLDR but apply it to that particular company as well as Deep Archive. Look up any of the hundreds of posts asking where they should go after they recieved the email from Google... Hell, I'm convinced half the people asking about Deep Archive comes from that incident.\n\nI'm assuming the people who made it this far either know the basics or just want to learn why it's not an option for most people. Welcome! This next part is in order of how much it'll hurt your wallet when you need the data back!\n\n1. Internet Egress Fees (Major)\n\nThe short version is, you're looking at about $90/TB to get your data back. This will constitute the majority of your fees under normal circumstances. Hopefully this isn't news to anyone who already set one up or was planning on doing it in the near future. As I understand it, this isn't a Deep Archive specific thing. Pretty much all internet egrees on AWS is $0.09/GB, so it doesn't matter if you're using frequent access or instant retrieval archive.\n\nWhile egress to an AWS EC2 instance is significantly cheaper at $0.02/GB or completely free under certain circumstances... That doesn't actually help you all that much. Getting the data OUT of the instance costs the same, so all you're doing is tacking on $0.02/GB + the VM for nothing. Of course if you want to use the data from the VM, then this is cheaper.\n\nTake this next part with a grain of salt, but it seems like you CAN get 1TB-ish out for free by using some of their networking adjacent services. But I'm guessing most of the people hoping to upload hundreds of terabytes don't want to recover 1TB...\n\nAnother alternative method is AWS snowball or snowmobile. If you need to egress a lot of data this *could* make sense. But remember, they're lending you a high end storage server... It ain't cheap.\n\n2. S3 Bucket Fees (Minor)\n\nUnlike google drive, drop box or whatever nonarchival storage service you're used to... You can't just copy paste the data back to your server. You have to copy it to Amazon's S3 storage and THEN do the copy. The transfer from Deep Archive to S3 is free as far as I know so you don't have to worry about that.\n\nThe cost is relatively minor in comparison to the thing above. You pay for the capacity you're retrieving multiplied by how long you need it for multiplied by the storage tier. The first part entirely depends on you, the second one is basically your internet connection speed, the latter is more or less up to you.\n\n3. API Fees (Negligible)\n\nYou have to pay in order to request your data back. This cost is very very very inconsequential for most things, it's on the order of fractions of a cent per thousand files. If you want to store millions upon millions of files... You might want to consider concating those files... Also how the hell did you upload that many small files in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n4. Delayed Retrieval (Depends)\n\nUnlike Dropbox or OneDrive, you can't just copy paste your data even with the extra steps mentioned in number 2. After you request your data, you have to wait a few hours or even a few days depending on the type of request.\n\nI believe standard is 5 hours, bulk is 2 days(?). Some of the hotter tiers also have instant retrieval or expedited tiers, but deep archive is cheap for many reasons and this is one of them.\n\nThis delay will basically bork any backup program because they typically read some blocks / chunks to see if the new file is already in the repository. Waiting upwards of 2 days per chunk... Isn't going to be very fast.\n\nShould you choose not to believe me, here's a quote from the Kopia documentation. You can try it if you want, but if anything happens thats a 'you' problem.\n\n&gt;Kopia does not currently support cloud storage that provides delayed access to your files \u2013 namely, archive storage such as Amazon Glacier Deep Archive. Do not try it; things will break.\n\nYou technically could just set up new repositories every time you want to upload by uploading to an S3 bucket and have a Lifecycle policy move it to Deep Archive after a set period of time... But that seems inordinately stupid.\n\n5. File Retention (Depends)\n\nIt's 180 days. No, this does not mean AWS will delete your files if it's not on your hard drive like B2 personal. AWS doesn't give a shit as long as you keep paying them. Instead, this means every time you modify a file (or rather upload a modified version of an existing file), or delete one... It'll be retained for 180 days and you'll keep paying for the capacity that file uses for 180 days.\n\nThis makes backup programs even more messy because most (all?) of the ones that use chunking will have to modify multiple chunks and all of the modified ones will get retained for 180 days in their entirety. This could theoretically mean you pay exponentially more every time you sync (up to the 180th day since the initial upload) just because a bunch of chunks get updated. Not sure how the math works out on that, but I don't really care enough to find out.\n\n6. File Versioning (Depends)\n\nThere is no versioning, there is no delta / diff like ZFS snapshots. If you want 2 versions of a file you're paying for both their entire capacities. You *could* get around this with compression / dedupe by uploading ZFS volumes or ZPAQ files... But then you have to egress every time you need a new version. Considering storage is cheap and egress is expensive, this is an ass backwards solution.\n\nFinal Example\n\nSay I want to retrieve 5x 200GB files. I pay essentially $0.00 in API fees, 1TB of standard S3 ($0.023/GB per month) and with my internet speed I'd need it for 2 days (or maybe 4 days if I need it during the retrieval period...?). So far, about $1.6~3.2 not bad.\n\nNext up is the big one ; Egress at $92.16, might as well throw in the other minor fees to make our total a bit spicier.\n\nTotal : $93.76 for retrieving 1TB of data. If you need 10TB multiply that by 10. If you need 100TB then multiply it by 100.\n\nAt this point you may be wondering, who the hell is this for? Who could possibly ever need such a bizzare and complicated system?... Refer to the TLDR ;)\n\nIf you have data that never changes, and you have proper backups and want Deep Archive juuuuust in case shit hits the fan multiple times in a row AND you want that data back no matter the cost? Something like family photos perhaps? Or super duper important business records you absolutely MUST have? Be my guest. But I'd wager this doesn't apply to most people asking for it, or at least doesn't apply to the vast majority of their data.", "author_fullname": "t2_upalof7y", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Preemptively answering questions about Deep Archive / AWS Glacier", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_15jp7s4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "76c43f34-b98b-11e2-b55c-12313b0b21ae", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1691327911.0, "author_flair_css_class": "dvd", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1691327182.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR : The answer is no, don&amp;#39;t use it.

I've heard it's supposedly one of the best in the country which is why I'm kind of set on sending it there. If they can't recover the data no one probably can.
