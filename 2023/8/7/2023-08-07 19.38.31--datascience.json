The recent example from Amazon's senior leadership really got me boiling, and I just had to get this off my chest.\n\nAs a data science practitioner myself\u2026 it's disheartening to see executives in both my field and beyond often using data points to validate their existing beliefs rather than *truly* utilizing data to guide their decisions. The cornerstone of our work is to analyze and interpret data objectively to uncover insights that inform strategic choices. Yet, time and again, we witness decisions driven by personal preferences and opinions rather than evidence.\n\nAmazon has long been regarded as a paragon of data-driven decision-making, and rightly so. The company has access to vast amounts of data and has used it effectively to shape their strategies and operations, such as Dynamic Pricing, Warehouse Optimization, and Fraud Detection. However, when I read about Mike Hopkins' statements regarding the return to office, I was shocked at the blatant disregard for fundamental data-driven principles.\n\nLet's break this down\u2026 Hopkins, a senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, made a bold statement in an internal meeting, stating that it's time to return to the office without providing *any* substantial data to back up his claim. He says, \"I don't have data to back it up, but I know it's better.\"\n\nThe essence of data-driven decision-making lies in using objective data to support or reject a belief or hypothesis. By admitting that he lacks the data to back up his position, Hopkins is essentially admitting that he's making an uninformed decision, and worse yet, he's trying to influence others to follow suit blindly.\n\nWhat's even more infuriating is that this kind of behavior is not *that* uncommon among senior management, even in my own personal experience. Many of them already have preconceived notions or personal preferences, and they cherry-pick data points to support their beliefs while conveniently ignoring any data that contradicts them. The complete opposite of what Data Science is meant to achieve.\n\nData-driven decision-making is crucial, especially when it comes to complex matters like remote work. Many employees have adapted to working from home, and some even prefer it due to increased flexibility and work-life balance. Forcing a return to the office without concrete data to support the move is a clear sign of executive arrogance and a lack of respect for their employees' preferences and well-being.\n\nIt's hard to believe that a company as data-driven as Amazon wouldn't have data on the productivity and effectiveness of remote work\u2026 the company likely has access to a *trove* of information that could shed light on the effectiveness of remote work, including productivity metrics, employee satisfaction surveys, and more. It's puzzling why they would not utilize this data to inform their decisions, especially when the well-being and productivity of their workforce are at stake. Without clear and data-backed justifications, employees may feel undervalued and may question the credibility of leadership's intentions.\n\nAmazon's senior leadership should remember their commitment to data-driven principles and engage in transparent decision-making. If there are legitimate reasons to return to the office, they owe it to their employees to present the data and engage in an open discussion about the pros and cons. By withholding critical information, they are undermining trust and potentially making decisions that could hurt the company in the long run.\n\nAs a data science practitioner, I believe it's not just about having access to data; it's also about using it responsibly and ethically. Using data to back up preconceived beliefs, or worse, hiding data that counters those beliefs, undermines the credibility and ethics of data science as a field and the trust we place in data-driven decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, the misuse and omission of data by executives is not only frustrating to witness but also detrimental to the progress of organizations. I find it incredibly disappointing that executives at Amazon, a company known for being data-driven, would advocate for a return to the office without any supporting data. As data scientists, we have a responsibility to advocate for the ethical and rigorous use of data, and as consumers and employees, we have the right to demand evidence-based decision-making from the companies we support.\n\nAm I alone in this? I'd love to hear the community\u2019s thoughts on this matter.\n\nTL;DR: Amazon's senior leadership's recent push for a return to office without any supporting data is a disappointment to their reputation as a data-driven company. Executives should practice what they preach and make decisions based on objective data rather than personal beliefs or preferences. This behavior is not only disrespectful to employees but also detrimental to the company's long-term success. When data takes a backseat it flies in the face of what Data Science is all about.  \n\n\nLink to article: [https://fortune.com/2023/08/03/amazon-svp-mike-hopkins-office-return/](https://fortune.com/2023/08/03/amazon-svp-mike-hopkins-office-return/)", "author_fullname": "t2_tphsqrss", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "From Data-Driven to Data-Ignored\u2026 a disappointing shift at Amazon", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 70, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3n4q0xzevjgb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 116, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66fa9b20726380d2c64a8f11585565e6b8e10cf"}, {"y": 232, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7867687ef4408ca982ee13bd05b802b627ee6ce3"}, {"y": 344, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dbacc730b1a6d1315a23926c76aeea162eccd4d"}, {"y": 688, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16bd3ac19ba09bc5059d769cf9402463f00dbdeb"}], "s": {"y": 767, "x": 713, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38bb199895cb4217c70a1a0f1431ee721d26f45b"}, "id": "3n4q0xzevjgb1"}}, "name": "t3_15jzuh8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 171, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 171, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PcBjIP_0pqtJFSeqLI5xEd5mmap1p8pqxYG_kAtN42Y.jpg", "edited": 1691354432.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1691354029.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=713&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=38bb199895cb4217c70a1a0f1431ee721d26f45b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=713&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=38bb199895cb4217c70a1a0f1431ee721d26f45b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t help but feel the need to share my frustration with the way some executives handle decision-making processes, especially when it comes to \u201cdata-driven\u201d decisions.

Are there any specific feature engineering techniques or algorithms that work well for this scenario?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_3cqa1", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15kjn7f", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Confettiie", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/15kjn7f/anyone_knows_ip_address_and_fraud_transaction/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/15kjn7f/anyone_knows_ip_address_and_fraud_transaction/", "subreddit_subscribers": 326602, "created_utc": 1691412079.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1691412315.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.learnmachinelearning", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/15kjn7f/anyone_knows_ip_address_and_fraud_transaction/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "937a6f50-d780-11e7-826d-0ed1beddcc82", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15kjqec", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Confettiie", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_15kjn7f", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15kjqec/anyone_knows_ip_address_and_fraud_transaction/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/15kjn7f/anyone_knows_ip_address_and_fraud_transaction/", "subreddit_subscribers": 978201, "created_utc": 1691412315.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
