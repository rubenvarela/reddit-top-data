I hope this article is a helpful and approachable overview if you are new to the world of SSH!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://www.jacoblyman.com/tech-log/ssh-for-data-scientists", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/uOv5g_R5czH4iybPav4KPXT-GmDPFwtRkfKuy9EAv08.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e005ae660e8f2dca9a2a9db8f72ecec8a6ebce4e", "width": 819, "height": 460}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/uOv5g_R5czH4iybPav4KPXT-GmDPFwtRkfKuy9EAv08.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27321a246e37cecefd4440d2ba4417e206c68580", "width": 108, "height": 60}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/uOv5g_R5czH4iybPav4KPXT-GmDPFwtRkfKuy9EAv08.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dc7401b252848e169045c4b376be3950384ce23", "width": 216, "height": 121}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/uOv5g_R5czH4iybPav4KPXT-GmDPFwtRkfKuy9EAv08.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc3759658acd80458b4d28915a4d7e93d1d0b64", "width": 320, "height": 179}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/uOv5g_R5czH4iybPav4KPXT-GmDPFwtRkfKuy9EAv08.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65eb00e8a1ab7bea92a2b7334dfdcafdb3c3996", "width": 640, "height": 359}], "variants": {}, "id": "Zgq4eaBk_bVp1Ogn4x9jC6f_WgEAsPRr9rdgTyi7FvY"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "99f9652a-d780-11e7-b558-0e52cdd59ace", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15s0sva", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jacobwlyman", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15s0sva/knowing_ssh_is_a_very_helpful_but_often/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.jacoblyman.com/tech-log/ssh-for-data-scientists", "subreddit_subscribers": 991157, "created_utc": 1692124603.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I can't think of a single job where you are not able to reference something at any point.

So here is the short version of my latest article:\n\nAs businesses expand and engage more consumers, the interactions between their apps and services grow increasingly intricate. These intricate designs can lead to challenges like vital components becoming unresponsive, scaling obstacles, and reduced adaptability.\n\nHowever, it's not just the system complexities. Rapid technological advancement and universal internet access have set a high bar. Modern consumers expect immediate responses and interactions. Such shifts in business operations and technological landscapes are termed 'events' within the tech sphere.\n\nFor clarity, events can generally be categorized as:\n\n\\- Business-related\n\n\\- System-induced\n\n\\- Technical\n\nRecognizing and making sense of these events promptly is pivotal. The goal is to have a system that can efficiently manage these events without hitches.\n\nTo back this up, a study by Gartner \u2014 which examined the correlation between data processing speeds and derived value \u2014 found that systems that swiftly handle events maximize their output. Hence, for businesses, speed isn't just an advantage; it's a necessity.\n\nMany businesses and tech architects are turning towards Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to optimize their operations. EDA isn't just a fancy term; it's a transformative approach that has streamlined data and event processing across various sectors.\n\n**Microservices**\n\nTraditionally, businesses have relied on the same Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), leading to large, unwieldy structures filled with old code. This accumulation makes them hard to modify and update. To address these challenges, the tech world introduced 'microservices.'\n\nThere are many tools for creating microservices, with REST (Representational State Transfer) being a prevalent choice. Yet, choosing REST alone doesn't guarantee efficiency. A well-structured microservice should:\n\n\\- Easily integrate with novel features, achievable via loose connections\n\n\\- Distribute data components in multiple ways, enhancing overall processing\n\n\\- Implement a delayed execution strategy to optimize performance and responsiveness\n\n\\- Ensure reliable delivery, especially when faced with unexpected issues\n\n\\- Avoid intricate and uncertain states following system failures\n\nHowever, as with any technology, microservices have their challenges. Issues can range from duplicated data fields to the necessity for efficient communication between microservices. Addressing these challenges requires the right tools and a keen focus on system design.\n\n**Event-Driven APIs**\n\nSynchronously operating microservices have their limitations. The future is pointing towards asynchronous interactions and EDA. As the tech community recognizes the value of EDA, there's a push towards integrating events more closely with microservices.\n\nTransitioning to EDA isn't just about implementing new tools; it requires a paradigm shift. Stakeholders and designers must transition from traditional data-focused methodologies to those emphasizing events.\n\n**EDAs bring to the table numerous benefits:**\n\n**Scalability:** Event-driven APIs can efficiently manage vast request volumes, processing events simultaneously across various channels.\n\n**Real-time Processing:** Instantaneous event response eliminates the need for constant data checks.\n\n**System Independence:** Changes in one system don't necessarily disrupt another, giving each the freedom to evolve.\n\n**Dynamic Data Flow:** Events can be generated and processed diversely, granting more control over data handling.\n\nIn conclusion, the landscape of business app integrations is evolving. With the right strategies and technologies, businesses can remain agile and responsive in an ever-changing environment. Embracing these changes is not just about staying current; it's about leading the way in innovation.\n\nCheck out the full article here: [https://ainsys.com/blog/2023/03/02/api-evolution-whats-next/?utm\\_source=linkedin&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_campaign=%0Adata\\_engineering&amp;utm\\_content=api\\_evolution&amp;utm\\_term=ITarchitecture](https://ainsys.com/blog/2023/03/02/api-evolution-whats-next/?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=%0Adata_engineering&amp;utm_content=api_evolution&amp;utm_term=ITarchitecture) ", "author_fullname": "t2_ct09rz3s", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Event-Driven Architectures and Microservices: Revolutionizing Business App Integrations", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_15ryszq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1692120103.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit!

We demonstrate that this technique can be easily applied to arbitrary diffusion models, including text-conditioned Stable Diffusion, as a plug-in with negligible loss in FID. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full article: &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/aiguys/watermarking-in-the-age-of-ai-generated-images-3d3649c8bd1f\"&gt;https://medium.com/aiguys/watermarking-in-the-age-of-ai-generated-images-3d3649c8bd1f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y4s6s3o1neib1.png?width=768&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba832e34574f393db101a3983ac757c74585059a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/y4s6s3o1neib1.png?width=768&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba832e34574f393db101a3983ac757c74585059a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "99f9652a-d780-11e7-b558-0e52cdd59ace", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15sg3a9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Difficult-Race-1188", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15sg3a9/watermarking_in_the_age_of_aigenerated_images/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15sg3a9/watermarking_in_the_age_of_aigenerated_images/", "subreddit_subscribers": 991157, "created_utc": 1692162249.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hey All,\n\nI'm looking to start my first PC build and was kinda just looking for general commentary, or to get roasted...\n\nSome background - I currently work as a software engineer and am about to start grad school for a masters in CS with a specilization in machine learning/deep learning.
