I was an EIC (Engineer In Charge) running a team of engineers for about 7 years doing field service work (modifications, troubleshooting, and analyzing etch semiconductor equipment).\n\nTwo years ago I began schooling for Computer Science B.S. Last September, I was offered a new role as a Data Analyst II doing remote diagnostics for the same tools I work on while I finish my degree (same company). I've been doing that and enjoying it, finding trends in the data and offering suggestions, etc. To better serve our customer. \n\nAs of July, I was offered,  and began, a job rotation program with our data science team that creates data products for our diagnostics team (us). The goal was to be able to learn from them for six months, and then be able to make better data products for our data analyst team going forward since the data science team serves multiple teams and sometimes our basic requests are postponed for months.\n\nThis is my first real week. I work a total of M-Thurs. Monday and Tuesday as my normal analyst role, Wed. and Thursday are my job rotation days. \n\nI am feeling WILDLY overwhelmed though. I have no enterprise SQL or Python experience, just little projects I've made for our team and on the side through schooling. Today, they were like, \"ok, your task is to create a script that takes in csv files and manipulates them to be better ingested in X data base, and triggers anytime the csv files are populated into Y folder.\" I haven't even touched SQL in like a year. They set me up with Azure Data Studio, and there are like 8 servers we are connected to, some SQLserver, some PostGres, which I know nothing about. I also have to learn about sprints on Monday.com, Prefect.com flows and managing/ troubleshooting pipelines as they go down, Power BI dashboard issues, and a myriad of other things. PLUS, I have 15 data products that are currently excel macros our analyst team uses to analyze our tool logs for diagnostics stuff, that we want to convert to a single standalone application all wrapped into one. This was the main reason I was brought into the rotation.\n\nThe main goal of this was the transition of the data products, but now I'm being stretched across like 40 different things. \n\nWednesdays, we have 6 meetings, all an hour or more long, essentially leaving me like a total of 13 or 14 hours to do all of this per week. \n\nLike holy shit. I am going to set up a meeting next week with the data science manager to better establish a flow and goals, because I think there is a huge misunderstanding or something. I don't know how in the hell they think this is normal. IS THIS NORMAL? \n\nI need like a month (basically four of the Thursdays) just to do YouTube refreshers/ learning about all these different platforms, SQL, Python, etc. Just so I have some clue what I am looking at. I need to shadow these people while they're troubleshooting so I can see some sort of process I can follow.

I was an EIC (Engineer In Charge) running a team of engineers for about 7 years doing field service work (modifications, troubleshooting, and analyzing etch semiconductor equipment).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I began schooling for Computer Science B.S. Last September, I was offered a new role as a Data Analyst II doing remote diagnostics for the same tools I work on while I finish my degree (same company). I&amp;#39;ve been doing that and enjoying it, finding trends in the data and offering suggestions, etc. To better serve our customer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of July, I was offered,  and began, a job rotation program with our data science team that creates data products for our diagnostics team (us). The goal was to be able to learn from them for six months, and then be able to make better data products for our data analyst team going forward since the data science team serves multiple teams and sometimes our basic requests are postponed for months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my first real week. I work a total of M-Thurs. Monday and Tuesday as my normal analyst role, Wed. and Thursday are my job rotation days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am feeling WILDLY overwhelmed though. I have no enterprise SQL or Python experience, just little projects I&amp;#39;ve made for our team and on the side through schooling. Today, they were like, &amp;quot;ok, your task is to create a script that takes in csv files and manipulates them to be better ingested in X data base, and triggers anytime the csv files are populated into Y folder.&amp;quot; I haven&amp;#39;t even touched SQL in like a year. They set me up with Azure Data Studio, and there are like 8 servers we are connected to, some SQLserver, some PostGres, which I know nothing about. I also have to learn about sprints on Monday.com, Prefect.com flows and managing/ troubleshooting pipelines as they go down, Power BI dashboard issues, and a myriad of other things. PLUS, I have 15 data products that are currently excel macros our analyst team uses to analyze our tool logs for diagnostics stuff, that we want to convert to a single standalone application all wrapped into one. This was the main reason I was brought into the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this was the transition of the data products, but now I&amp;#39;m being stretched across like 40 different things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesdays, we have 6 meetings, all an hour or more long, essentially leaving me like a total of 13 or 14 hours to do all of this per week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like holy shit. I am going to set up a meeting next week with the data science manager to better establish a flow and goals, because I think there is a huge misunderstanding or something. I don&amp;#39;t know how in the hell they think this is normal. IS THIS NORMAL? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need like a month (basically four of the Thursdays) just to do YouTube refreshers/ learning about all these different platforms, SQL, Python, etc. Just so I have some clue what I am looking at. I need to shadow these people while they&amp;#39;re troubleshooting so I can see some sort of process I can follow.
