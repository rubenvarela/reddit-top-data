This is why it's so hard for them to create meaningful requests and requirements.\n\n2. Ask your stakeholders about the business context, the reason why the request is being made, and how the output will be used by the business.

Use your domain expertise to map the business requirements to data requirements-- this is now your \"translation\" map for all future communications.\n\n4. With this mapping you need to answer the following without \"speaking data\" to your stakeholder: a) what was the business challenge, b) what is the solution to this business problem, and c) how they can use this solution today. This stakeholder is going to pass this information on to others, so train them to be successful in that.

It is a completely new world to me, and although they are aware that I had no previous experience with that, they are encouraging me to play around and figure it out while offering complete support. \nI do understand that I need to ask questions, but I do not want to overdo that and burden my colleagues. I\u2019m just afraid that this is all too complicated even though I managed to create some thing but to be honest, I\u2019m not really sure even how I did it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For half an hour I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m super dumb and then for five minutes I think I got it and then again back to square one and like that throughout the whole day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even sat on two meetings where they discussed things that almost sounded like a foreign language to me, but I managed to give a constructive feedback after that, even though they didn\u2019t ask. They were appreciative of it, and seem to genuinely think that it was a good feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have any advice for me? I would greatly appreciate it.

Used to be skilled in SQL, Python, and R, but has been a couple years since I have used them regularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any recommendations on best sources of learning for a SQL crash course? Specifically that would prepare me for the types of questions/skills they would look for in a basic interview. Any guidance much appreciated&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5cb03a64-2769-11ea-aa04-0ed301f44875", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qp8q", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "15fyc0d", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "noah-o-927", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/SQL/comments/15fyc0d/crash_course_for_sql_interview/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/15fyc0d/crash_course_for_sql_interview/", "subreddit_subscribers": 153370, "created_utc": 1690949241.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1690949451.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.SQL", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/SQL/comments/15fyc0d/crash_course_for_sql_interview/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15fyei8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "noah-o-927", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_15fyc0d", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15fyei8/crash_course_for_sql_interview/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/SQL/comments/15fyc0d/crash_course_for_sql_interview/", "subreddit_subscribers": 971566, "created_utc": 1690949451.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hello!
