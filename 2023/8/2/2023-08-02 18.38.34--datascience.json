Now tell me about a thousand rows in an excel sheet... it's hard. This is exactly what your stakeholders are facing. This is why it's so hard for them to create meaningful requests and requirements.\n\n2. Ask your stakeholders about the business context, the reason why the request is being made, and how the output will be used by the business. Ask probing questions about the business and not the data.\n\n3. Use your domain expertise to map the business requirements to data requirements-- this is now your \"translation\" map for all future communications.\n\n4. With this mapping you need to answer the following without \"speaking data\" to your stakeholder: a) what was the business challenge, b) what is the solution to this business problem, and c) how they can use this solution today. This stakeholder is going to pass this information on to others, so train them to be successful in that.

This includes defining projects, assigning tasks, prioritizing reports, and creating timelines.\n* Presenting to executives to provide updates on projects, discuss feedback, and provide direction when they have a new ask\n* Work with stakeholders to define business needs and then spec out reports and dashboards to provide actionable insights based on those needs\n* Define the logic needed to align our data with our business processes and provide it to the outsourced vendor\n* Data validation\n* Write basic SQL queries for ad hoc data requests\n* Create and tweak dashboards if they are simple or don't take too long\n* Manage a different outsourced team to build out a company website to stick to the original scope of the project, conduct user testing, establish timelines, write messaging to communicate updates both internally and to our customers, provide training. There are three planned phases of this website that we are treating as three separate projects with three separate contracts and we are finishing up the first.

I am defining the business processes, providing the logic for data manipulation, and defining the structure of the tables with guidance from our vendor. I also make sure internal team members are finishing their project related tasks on time.\n\nI am basically the subject matter expert for all our reporting capabilities and any projects related to that. I feel that what I am missing in my role is more experience actually writing SQL queries and building out dashboards. My current job doesn't really give me the chance to dive into that given the other resources we have dedicated to that and the time I spend managing projects.

This includes defining projects, assigning tasks, prioritizing reports, and creating timelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Presenting to executives to provide updates on projects, discuss feedback, and provide direction when they have a new ask&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with stakeholders to define business needs and then spec out reports and dashboards to provide actionable insights based on those needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define the logic needed to align our data with our business processes and provide it to the outsourced vendor&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data validation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write basic SQL queries for ad hoc data requests&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create and tweak dashboards if they are simple or don&amp;#39;t take too long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage a different outsourced team to build out a company website to stick to the original scope of the project, conduct user testing, establish timelines, write messaging to communicate updates both internally and to our customers, provide training. There are three planned phases of this website that we are treating as three separate projects with three separate contracts and we are finishing up the first. I will do this for all three projects. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work alongside an outsourced team as we build out our data warehouse. I am defining the business processes, providing the logic for data manipulation, and defining the structure of the tables with guidance from our vendor. I also make sure internal team members are finishing their project related tasks on time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am basically the subject matter expert for all our reporting capabilities and any projects related to that. I feel that what I am missing in my role is more experience actually writing SQL queries and building out dashboards. My current job doesn&amp;#39;t really give me the chance to dive into that given the other resources we have dedicated to that and the time I spend managing projects. Again, I really like what I do and I&amp;#39;m wondering what kinds of roles I should be looking for while I start to think about my next career move. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15fvv67", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Much_Lifeguard_4116", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15fvv67/what_is_my_job_and_where_can_i_go_from_here/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15fvv67/what_is_my_job_and_where_can_i_go_from_here/", "subreddit_subscribers": 971912, "created_utc": 1690942020.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I am currently machine learning engineer.

My first role was with a company that was really behind the curve when it came to DS, models were built and run in notebooks, no level of production. I\u2019d say it was half way between an analyst/DS role. I would spend a lot of time building models, but they often wouldn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything (the CEO loved the idea of DS but clearly didn\u2019t want to commit to supporting the team with any tools/training for productionization of models). \n\nThis left me feeling like I was falling behind the curve and wasting time in this role. I applied (for about 6 months!) and recently landed a role in a tech company working in a really skilled team with a really good tech stack.\n\nMy issue is, I hate it. The job itself if interesting and individually the team are kind and supportive, but there is a really toxic work ethic and it\u2019s not what I\u2019m built for. There is a level of knowledge that is expected that I clearly don\u2019t have. The role is a mix of DS/MLE which seems to be the norm nowadays. I can handle the DS side well, but it\u2019s the MLE side that I don\u2019t understand and don\u2019t really have the motivation to learn right now. \n\nI\u2019m now in this weird spot where I have this job that looks great on a CV, but I feel as though I should\u2019ve had another role in-between this one and my previous one where I can learn MLE and be better prepared for the stress this role brings.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience when you have landed a job that is perhaps beyond where you are in your career? I doubled my salary with this move but that has been the only positive I\u2019ve found, I wake up every day dreading work!\n\nI realise I\u2019m in a lucky position to have this job so I hope it doesn\u2019t seem like I\u2019m whining, I would just like to know if this is common, thanks!", "author_fullname": "t2_46vy7hqa", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Disaster job or imposter syndrome?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_15gabl3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1690986354.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For context, I\u2019ve been a DS for 2+ years and have an MSc in DS.

I would spend a lot of time building models, but they often wouldn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything (the CEO loved the idea of DS but clearly didn\u2019t want to commit to supporting the team with any tools/training for productionization of models). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This left me feeling like I was falling behind the curve and wasting time in this role. I applied (for about 6 months!) and recently landed a role in a tech company working in a really skilled team with a really good tech stack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My issue is, I hate it. The job itself if interesting and individually the team are kind and supportive, but there is a really toxic work ethic and it\u2019s not what I\u2019m built for. There is a level of knowledge that is expected that I clearly don\u2019t have. The role is a mix of DS/MLE which seems to be the norm nowadays. I can handle the DS side well, but it\u2019s the MLE side that I don\u2019t understand and don\u2019t really have the motivation to learn right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m now in this weird spot where I have this job that looks great on a CV, but I feel as though I should\u2019ve had another role in-between this one and my previous one where I can learn MLE and be better prepared for the stress this role brings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had this experience when you have landed a job that is perhaps beyond where you are in your career? I doubled my salary with this move but that has been the only positive I\u2019ve found, I wake up every day dreading work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realise I\u2019m in a lucky position to have this job so I hope it doesn\u2019t seem like I\u2019m whining, I would just like to know if this is common, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": true, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15gabl3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mancityfan97", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15gabl3/disaster_job_or_imposter_syndrome/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15gabl3/disaster_job_or_imposter_syndrome/", "subreddit_subscribers": 971912, "created_utc": 1690986354.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019ve never posted on this sub so forgive me if I\u2019m breaking any rules ( I read them as well but just in case lol)\n\nI\u2019ve got this amazing opportunity and started my 6 month long paid internship in a very innovative company with very supportive people. \n\nThey know that I have no real experience in IT and I never lied that I do, only that I\u2019m enrolled in an \u201cIT\u201d program with my college (1 year long, 6 months left to go). \n\nI was afraid that I would do menial tasks and not learn anything but to my surprise it seems to be the other end of that extreme.
