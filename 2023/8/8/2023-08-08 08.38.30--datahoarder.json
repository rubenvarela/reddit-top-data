Here's a breakdown of my current infrastructure, challenges, and questions (I try to make it as structured as possible for you):\n\n**Current Setup:**\n\nI own a Macbook Pro which holds all of my essential productive data, including various projects and files. Additionally, I currently use a NAS (Synology DS1511+, 7.8TB of capacity) to store my media files, such as e.g. the photos for my Lightroom library. To enhance performance, I'm planning to migrate these data to a faster external SSD.\n\n**Goals and Challenges:**\n\n1. **Backup Strategy (3-2-1 Principle):** I'm keen on implementing a solid backup strategy following the 3-2-1 principle. This means having three copies of my data, stored across two different media, with one copy off-site.\n2. **Online Backup:** I've explored the option of online backup through services like Backblaze. However, I'm looking for insights into the reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness of this approach.\n3. **Data Security:** Ensuring the safety of my sensitive data is paramount. What encryption methods are recommended for both local and online storage?\n4. **Data Synchronization:** How can I seamlessly synchronize data between my Macbook Pro, external SSD, and NAS without the risk of data loss or conflicts?\n5. **Versioning and Recovery:** What's the best way to manage versioning and facilitate easy recovery of previous file versions if needed?\n6. **Data Accessibility and Speed:** I want a solution that allows me to access my data quickly, both from my Macbook Pro and the external SSD. Speed would be nice but first I need to solve the backup situation.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. **File Organization:** Tips and best practices for maintaining a well-organized file structure across multiple storage devices.\n2. **Redundancy:** Beyond the 3-2-1 strategy, are there additional redundancy measures I should take into account?\n3. **Data Integrity:** How can I periodically check and ensure the integrity of my stored data to prevent silent corruption?\n4. **Long-Term Archiving:** In the future, I'll be digitizing my family's analog photos. These images need to be preserved as long as possible. What are the recommended approaches for archiving these digital memories securely and for the long term?\n5. **Budget-Friendly Solutions:** While I'm willing to invest in a reliable solution, cost-effectiveness is still a factor. What balance should I strike between quality and affordability?\n6. **Btrfs Filesystem:** I've come across Btrfs as a potential file system for backups. It's said to offer advantages like improved data integrity, snapshot capabilities, and scalability. I'd love to hear any experiences or opinions on whether Btrfs could enhance my backup strategy or not.\n\nAt first, it sounded like a \"standard\" issue but right now I'm super overwhelmed with the topic, and the more I read and the more I go down all these rabbit holes I get more lost.

I keep these drives mirrored on Backblaze.\n\nIn total I have 14TB useable space across these drives and I'm approaching capacity so I want to lock off these drives, keep them as backups and expand capacity building a new RAID with some new drives.\n\nI'm thinking of getting 6 x 16TB drives, putting 4 in the R4 in RAID 5 for a total of 48TB and using that as my main brain (I'm a professional music producer). That would see active use loading projects directly from the drive etc as well as an image of my main workstation's internal 8TB SSD, I would then take the G-RAID home to use as a plex server / non crucial media storage.\n\nSo if 22TB of that is taken up straight away, I'd have around 26TB going forward plus the whole lot on backblaze.\n\nThe other 2 16TB drives I could just do JBOD with as they're not gonna have super important data and will also be synced to backblaze, unless you strongly advise against that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have 3 questions really:\n\n1 - Is RAID 5 still the right choice for a balance between parity / speed or would it be worth having complete redundancy with a different RAID config?\n\n2 - I was going to use WD Ultrastar 550 SATA Drives, but my R4 currently has SAS drives in it. Is it worth spending more money on 16TB SAS drives for my main brain (and if so what drives are recommended) or is SATA sufficient?\n\n3 - Is RAID 5, archive drive and backblaze adequate parity / redundancy for mission critical stuff on the  R4 or would you suggest something else?\n\nhope this is the right place to ask, seems like it!
