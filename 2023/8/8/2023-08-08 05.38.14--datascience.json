easy for someone on my level to get into the market who knows nothing about servers, or cloud computing, or which one has a low entry barrier?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes":

But my title is still junior after 2 years, I&amp;#39;ve been told I can&amp;#39;t have a title change or any transition to a different role, and it seems like I&amp;#39;m not being promoted anytime soon either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard for me to understand why, I get nothing but good feedback from the leadership closest to me including my direct manager and one of our directors recently called me &amp;quot;the person everyone wants&amp;quot; but if I ask for anything like career guidance or growth opportunities, I get nothing. I keep being pushed into PM work because I suspect they want to offload that work on me even though I&amp;#39;ve told them I really hate that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I basically have no choice but to change roles but all I hear is the market is garbage and I have several things working against me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a junior for too long, people will immediately toss my resume based on the title alone&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They won&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;ve literally done all of these things on my own with zero direction or mentorship given my title and seniority&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a specialist, any role I apply for will want a certain level of experience. Ex: I know a good amount about Docker but I&amp;#39;m sure there are certain things that only come up in real world circumstances that I won&amp;#39;t know no matter how much I use it on my own.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feels like there&amp;#39;s no answer but to do everything I can to leave but maybe someone here has better advice or has experienced something similar? Any help is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15kx73z", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Prudent_Spider", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15kx73z/any_advice_appreciated_for_unusual_career/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15kx73z/any_advice_appreciated_for_unusual_career/", "subreddit_subscribers": 978465, "created_utc": 1691442608.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi everyone, first post on reddit after years of lurking different subs. Sorry if there's any specific posting/formatting rules I'm not following! The post might be a little bit long, but I will try to make it short \n\n**Background**: \n\nI'm a recent BS grad from an R1 research state school in Washington (UW lol) and when I went in, I initially thought I'd be into med school and then half way I switched tracks to pharmaceutical research because I was interested in drug development. So during my 3 years there (1.5yrs of remote/pandemic learning), I did medicinal research for 2 years, doing antibiotics or drug discovery, involving a lot of physical laboratory work, like what you would see in a traditional biochem/biology lab. Which I think is fun and I'm really good at what I do, but I happened to pick up CS during my summer internship making cancer drugs and I found it really interesting. I started taking programming courses in my senior year, it was really too late to switch majors at that point.\n\nI didn't really get to pick up any internships from tech companies or industry because I came to the university already with 2 years of courses completed at a CC (I skipped 2yrs of high school) and my first 1.5 years at the university was during the pandemic/lockdown. So I really only had 1 summer available for an internship.\n\n**The main concern**:\n\nI learned Python, R, and a bit of SQL, and became really good at Tableau dashboards (making those are so fun lol) both during my research and from classroom courses. I've done several projects in Python and R and I also picked up a bit of machine learning but nothing like NLP and only applied LLM but didn't write code for it. I decided I want to pivot towards something like data science and eventually ML researcher or engineer later. I've been applying to places with roles like data scientists and data analysts and I've been having difficulties getting callbacks, probably 3 from the 150 I submitted. I'm definitely thinking about getting an MS or Ph.D, either in statistics or data science. \n\n**Question**:\n\nAm I underqualified for roles in tech because of my research background?

Here&amp;#39;s the code block for my model setup and training:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Extract the input text and emotion labels\ntexts = emotions_data[&amp;#39;clean_text&amp;#39;].values\nemotions = emotions_data.drop(columns=[&amp;#39;clean_text&amp;#39;]).values\n\n# Ensure emotion labels are in the form of numpy arrays\nemotions = np.array(emotions, dtype=&amp;#39;int32&amp;#39;)\n\n# Perform train-test split\ntrain_texts, test_texts, train_emotions, test_emotions = train_test_split(\n    texts, emotions, test_size=0.2, random_state=42\n)\n\n# Load the EmoRoBERTa tokenizer\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(&amp;quot;arpanghoshal/EmoRoBERTa&amp;quot;)\n\n# Tokenize the train and test data\ntrain_tokenized_data = tokenizer(list(train_texts), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=50)\ntest_tokenized_data = tokenizer(list(test_texts), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=50)\n\n# Create TensorFlow datasets from tokenized data\nbatch_size = 16\ntrain_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((\n    dict(train_tokenized_data),\n    train_emotions\n)).shuffle(len(train_texts)).batch(batch_size)\n\ntest_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((\n    dict(test_tokenized_data),\n    test_emotions\n)).batch(batch_size)\n\n# Load the pre-trained RoBERTa model for sequence classification\nmodel = TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(&amp;quot;arpanghoshal/EmoRoBERTa&amp;quot;)\n\n# Compile the model with optimizer, loss, and metric\noptimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-5)\nloss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\nmetrics = [&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]\nmodel.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)\n# Train the model\nhistory = model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10, validation_data=test_dataset)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite my steps to preprocess, clean the data, and fine-tune the model, I need help to improve my classification results. I&amp;#39;ve attempted several things and need help getting everything working. Despite these efforts, I&amp;#39;m still awaiting the improvements I&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate your insights or suggestions if anyone has experience with the GoEmotion dataset, similar emotion classification tasks, or working with Transformer models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,
