studying in the USA. I'm seeking some career advice, and I'd appreciate your input on my situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give you a quick overview of my background, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science in India. During my academic journey, I managed to gain some valuable experience through a couple of internships\u2014one in sales analytics and another in machine learning within the logistics industry. Additionally, I undertook two research projects focused on computer vision applied to geo data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, during my summer break, I was fortunate to secure a Data Science internship at a Venture Capital Firm. While I was grateful for the opportunity, this experience has left me somewhat confused about my career path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially, I had envisioned myself working in the finance domain as a data scientist or machine learning engineer. I believed that working with financial data would be both exciting and lucrative. However, my latest internship made me realize that the application of ML in the Venture Capital and finance field might not be as prevalent as I initially thought. The company I interned at is well-respected but appears to heavily rely on Excel for their financial operations. I had discussions with the Managing Director, who is in charge of integrating new technologies within the company, and he explained that the finance domain is relatively slow in adopting emerging tech like cloud and ML.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring my internship, I did get the chance to work with Python, SQL, and PowerBI, which made it feel more like a data engineer or database engineer role.

During my academic journey, I managed to gain some valuable experience through a couple of internships\u2014one in sales analytics and another in machine learning within the logistics industry. Additionally, I undertook two research projects focused on computer vision applied to geo data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, during my summer break, I was fortunate to secure a Data Science internship at a Venture Capital Firm. While I was grateful for the opportunity, this experience has left me somewhat confused about my career path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, I had envisioned myself working in the finance domain as a data scientist or machine learning engineer. I believed that working with financial data would be both exciting and lucrative. However, my latest internship made me realize that the application of ML in the Venture Capital and finance field might not be as prevalent as I initially thought. The company I interned at is well-respected but appears to heavily rely on Excel for their financial operations. I had discussions with the Managing Director, who is in charge of integrating new technologies within the company, and he explained that the finance domain is relatively slow in adopting emerging tech like cloud and ML.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During my internship, I did get the chance to work with Python, SQL, and PowerBI, which made it feel more like a data engineer or database engineer role.

I made training dataset by merging 12 datasets, each dataset has some common features, and some common label, and there are uncommon features and labels. So I outer-joined the data for training.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this training data is quite imbalanced itself (31%, 20%, 15%, 7%, 6%, 1%, ... 0.1 % for each class), this is quite challenging to me already, but even more, I can&amp;#39;t even suppose test dataset&amp;#39;s distribution (which means test dataset or real-world data that I should predict can be very different from training dataset distribution of class),   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;test dataset now I am using is quite imbalanced, has different distribution compared to training dataset, even more some of labels are missing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of approach, and deep learning model should I take? Or is there any good paper for these kind of problems? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15kzhxf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "poemfordumbs", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15kzhxf/how_would_you_treat_imbalanced_training_data_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15kzhxf/how_would_you_treat_imbalanced_training_data_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 978369, "created_utc": 1691447822.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "hey folks, not sure if this is the right place to post, but I've been developing a UI for searching through social media text corpora using document similarity and dimensionality reduction ML pipelines.
