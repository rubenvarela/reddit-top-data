The research technically concerns a video game that I play (Dota 2), but the actual problem is broadly applicable and basketball is a more commonly-understood entity. \n\n**TL;DR:** In the case where you have multiple high-dimensional categorical features that share domain spaces, are there feature engineering or encoding methods that allow you to pool together experience across different levels within a domain? \n\n**More detailed explanation:**\n\nAssume that there is a competitive pick-up basketball league comprised of the top 100 NBA players and your goal is to train a model to make a halftime prediction as to which team will ultimately win the game. You have a dataset of 500k-1MM games (maybe important since some solutions are more scalable):\n\n1. For each game, two teams of 5 players are drafted, for a 5v5 contest. \"Team effects\" and their interactions are non-negligible but are not the focus of this research (e.g., maybe Team 1 has a better view of the scoreboard and Team 2 has a more rowdy home crowd). LeBron might play slightly differently on Team 1 than Team 2 -- but his basketball skill is the exact same and his contribution to the prediction should be largely equivalent either way. \n\n2. Each player is assigned a specific position (Point Guard=1, \u2026 , Center=5). While we know that some players will be better at some positions, we can expect that the majority of players will play the majority of positions (e.g., LeBron might normally be a 3 or 4 but could play 1, 2, or 5 depending on the team comp).\n\n3. At the beginning of the game, each player goes into the kit room and picks a jersey, a pair of shorts, and a pair of shoes -- assume that different pieces of \"gear\" can significantly impact that player's performance (e.g., shoes: wearing Air Jordans give a boost to dunking, the Harden 7's makes refs give you better foul calls, etc.).\n \n4. Less important to this question, but you obviously also have numerical features relating to points, assists, blocks, movement/spatial data, etc. \n\nYour dataset might look something like this (T1=Team 1, PG=Point Guard, C=Center, etc.):\n\n\n|Game ID|T1_PG|T1_PG_Pts|T1_PG_Shoe|...|T2_C|T2_C_Pts|T2_C_Shoe|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|1|S. Curry|12|Air Jordans|...|L. James|9|LeBron NXXT Gen|\n|2|L. James|13|Air Jordans|...|N. Jokic|18|Harden 7's|\n|3|J. Harden|14|Harden 7's|...|N. Jokic|4|LeBron NXXT Gen|\n\n\nMy thought for players/positions would be to encode the player names and positions as the feature vector x\\_{i}, where i exists\\[1, 100\\] and i(1) = LeBron James, ... , i(100) = Nikola Jokic, such that:\n\n* x\\_{i} = 1 if T1\\_PG = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = 2 if T1\\_SG = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = 3 if T1\\_SF = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = 4 if T1\\_PF = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = 5 if T1\\_C = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = -1 if T2\\_PG = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = -2 if T2\\_SG = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = -3 if T2\\_SF = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = -4 if T2\\_PF = Player\\[i\\]\n* x\\_{i} = -5 if T2\\_C = Player\\[i\\]\n\nThis seems like a straightforward solution to me since a single player (LeBron) can only play for a single team in a given game. However, it gets much trickier when considering jersey/shorts/shoes because multiple players can wear the same items.\n\n* Label encoding (Air Jordans=1, Harden 7's=2, ...) has the benefit of being low-dimensional w.r.t the column space but also seems bad since the domain is large and there is no inherent ordering or linear nature. \n\n* One-hot encoding (binary indicator for each option) seems entirely infeasible because, assuming there were 20 possible shoe models, we would add 20x10=200 total features since each player can wear each shoe. This would then be repeated for jerseys and shorts. \n\n* Hashing methods or entity embedding can return relatively low-dimensional solutions but AFAIK can be incredibly opaque to understand when looking at the model's feature importance and trying to explain predictions. Additionally, with problems of this scale, it can be very time-consuming to need to train/tune models to produce cleaned features for every new cut or slice of data (to avoid data leakage).  \n\nAnother option we could consider would be to pool together experience across teams and, instead of framing this as a \"Team 1\" vs \"Team 2\" problem, frame it as \"Team\" vs \"Opposing Team\" problem. This way, we would inherently solve the issue of \"LeBron is the same player whether he is on Team 1 or Team 2\". However, it would obviously \\*double\\* the number of records, which could be an issue:\n\n|Game ID|T1_PG|T1_PG_Pts|T1_C|T1_C_Pts|T2_PG|T2_PG_Pts|T2_C|T2_C_Pts|\n--:|:--|--:|:--|--:|:--|--:|:--|--:|\n|1|S.

This limitation could potentially hinder the organization from staying at the forefront of data science advancements.\n\n## Outsourced Data Science Training\n\n### Outsourced Training Advantages\n\n#### Expertise from Specialized Data Science Training Providers\n\nOutsourced data science training brings the advantage of tapping into the expertise of specialized training providers. Reputed data science training firms employ instructors who possess vast industry experience, advanced knowledge, and a deep understanding of emerging data trends. By learning from these experts, employees gain insights into the most relevant tools, technologies, and methodologies, empowering them with a competitive edge in the fast-evolving data landscape.\n\n#### Faster Implementation and Reduced Development Time\n\nOutsourced training programs are designed to be efficient and effective, optimizing the learning process for rapid skill development. Unlike in-house training, which requires significant development time, outsourced training providers offer ready-to-use modules and learning resources that can be implemented swiftly. This streamlined approach ensures minimal disruption to the organization's daily operations and allows employees to apply their newfound skills promptly.\n\n#### Exposure to Cutting-edge Techniques and Industry Best Practices\n\nOne of the key benefits of outsourced training is the exposure to cutting-edge techniques and industry best practices. External trainers often work across various industries and organizations, giving them a broader perspective on data science challenges and solutions. This exposure equips employees with diverse insights, encouraging innovation, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement within the organization.\n\n### Outsourced Training Disadvantages\n\n#### Lack of Tailored Solutions for Specific Organizational Needs\n\nWhile outsourced training offers many advantages, one potential drawback is the lack of customization. Pre-designed training programs may not perfectly align with the organization's specific data challenges and business goals. Consequently, some aspects of the training content may not be directly applicable to the organization's unique context. To address this, organizations must carefully select training providers that offer flexibility and are willing to tailor the training content to meet their specific requirements.\n\n#### Potential Communication and Integration Challenges\n\nBringing external trainers into the organization may introduce communication and integration challenges. Differing work cultures and processes might hinder seamless collaboration between trainers and employees. To mitigate these challenges, clear communication channels should be established, and efforts made to integrate external trainers into the organization's ecosystem. This includes fostering open communication and encouraging a shared understanding of the organization's goals and values.\n\n#### Higher Costs compared to In-house Training\n\nOutsourced data science training can come with a higher price tag compared to in-house training. The cost of hiring external training providers, covering travel expenses (if applicable), and potentially paying premium fees for specialized expertise can be a significant consideration for organizations with budget constraints. However, it is crucial to weigh these training costs evaluation against the value of gaining access to top-tier training and industry insights that can lead to a well-equipped and competitive workforce.\n\n## Key Factors to Consider in Decision Making\n\nWhen choosing between in-house and outsourced data science training, several essential factors must be carefully evaluated.

Pre-designed training programs may not perfectly align with the organization&amp;#39;s specific data challenges and business goals. Consequently, some aspects of the training content may not be directly applicable to the organization&amp;#39;s unique context. To address this, organizations must carefully select training providers that offer flexibility and are willing to tailor the training content to meet their specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Potential Communication and Integration Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bringing external trainers into the organization may introduce communication and integration challenges. Differing work cultures and processes might hinder seamless collaboration between trainers and employees. To mitigate these challenges, clear communication channels should be established, and efforts made to integrate external trainers into the organization&amp;#39;s ecosystem. This includes fostering open communication and encouraging a shared understanding of the organization&amp;#39;s goals and values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Higher Costs compared to In-house Training&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outsourced data science training can come with a higher price tag compared to in-house training.
