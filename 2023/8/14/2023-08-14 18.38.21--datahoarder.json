(In case someone wants to ask why I was so stupid... the 2nd carried threw out the destroyed packaging and put it in a new box, a family member then received the seemingly pristine shipment.)\n\n2 - Contacted WD about the noise the (external, 16TB) HDD was making. Was told not to worry about it. Assured I could get a replacement during the next 3 years. (Amazon only offered a refund, I waited for that price for a year, ordering again for a much higher price was not acceptable for me.)\n\n3 - Of course, the drive stopped working several months later.\n\n4 - Created RMA on July 18th. Shipped on 21st, delivered to WD's address on 25th.\n\n5 - RMA status updated to \"Received / Processing\" on August 3rd. Checking almost every day, no other updates before or after that (till today, not just 8th). No emails till I contacted them first.\n\n6 - August 8th - Contacted WD (via chat) because of strange info about an undeliverable package (info notice number not working, no shipments linked to my address). Didn't know what else it could be other than the RMA replacement HDD. Talked to 2-3 people (internet stopped working + connected to \"a higher level\", I think), both/all told me the package was not from WD, nothing was sent to me yet, my RMA's accepted and waiting for replacement HDD shipment.\n\n7 - August 9th - Someone's \"taken over my case\", adding the screenshot of the email. Short version - WD definitely didn't ship anything (due to lack of stock), they'll be shipping an 18TB HDD, same model (if I agree). I agreed and addressed the rest. (Asked for the name to be changed to a family member's in the chat the previous day since I was already there, after being told shipment's still TBD, can't go and get it myself because of health issues. Answered \"You mentioned receiving an email about this package\" - Never happened. In the chat, I did mention, many times, receiving an info notice that was not in the carrier's system and wasn't linked to any packages or my address.)\n\n8 - August 10th - Short email summing up/confirming what will be done from WD, the same person (screenshot).\n\n9 - August 11th(sent)/13th(found) - Insane email from somebody new, with a tracking number belonging to a package shipped on August 1st (2 days before my RMA was RECEIVED) to a DIFFERENT CITY, being delivered on the 3rd, to, obviously, NOT ME. Adding screenshots. RMA was, of course, created with my address, which was also on the label of the package I shipped (\"From:\"). It really seems like it's not for me and it just got linked to me by mistake after laying somewhere for several days. The whole mess should've been noticed and dealt with internally, without throwing it like a hot potato to the customer and giving them a 10+-hour anxiety attack. \"We are happy to confirm...\" has never been so infuriating. As of right now, still no \"Carrier\", \"Tracking No\",  \"Shipped P/N + S/N\", and \"Shipped Date\" in my RMA (screenshot).\n\n10 - I have no (mental) energy and no polite words to say to WD as a response to this dumpster fire. Felt like throwing up since I found the email and looked at the tracking (the most expensive HDD I've ever bought). I'll... probably... wait for a few days... for the promised shipment of the 18TB HDD / legitimate/relevant RMA update. Maybe someone with a working brain will realize the mistake (after whatever's in the package is shipped back, shouldn't be too long now, has been undelivered/undeliverable somewhere for a week and a half now). . . ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Never posted here, probably haven't selected the right \"flair\".\n\n\\*\\* I did add several screenshots (Images &amp; Video tab), can't see them anywhere now, though (post awaiting moderator approval).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit (11 hours after posting): Just wanted to thank everyone who commented, not being alone in this helped me feel a little better. But then I thought about pushing/poking/contacting them again and instantly felt like throwing up again. It would be so much better if my experience was the usual \"weeks of no updates\". However, this BS shipment is now connected to MY RMA. (BTW, I, of course, don't know what's in the package, but it seems like \"WD\" doesn't know either.) I can already hear them telling me that they've already shipped \"it\" to me and it's my fault that I didn't receive it/pick it up, after I ask about the drive that was agreed upon on the 9th and 10th... not being able to comprehend what actually happened, just being stuck at \"this is what's in the system\", nobody from WD looking at it properly and thinking about it like a freaking human. Shouldn't have to, but I'll have to... Will update this in 4-8(?) days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* Let's see if the screenshots can be added in a different way... ah, 1 image only here...

It really seems like it&amp;#39;s not for me and it just got linked to me by mistake after laying somewhere for several days. The whole mess should&amp;#39;ve been noticed and dealt with internally, without throwing it like a hot potato to the customer and giving them a 10+-hour anxiety attack. &amp;quot;We are happy to confirm...&amp;quot; has never been so infuriating. As of right now, still no &amp;quot;Carrier&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tracking No&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Shipped P/N + S/N&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Shipped Date&amp;quot; in my RMA (screenshot).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 - I have no (mental) energy and no polite words to say to WD as a response to this dumpster fire. Felt like throwing up since I found the email and looked at the tracking (the most expensive HDD I&amp;#39;ve ever bought). I&amp;#39;ll... probably... wait for a few days... for the promised shipment of the 18TB HDD / legitimate/relevant RMA update. Maybe someone with a working brain will realize the mistake (after whatever&amp;#39;s in the package is shipped back, shouldn&amp;#39;t be too long now, has been undelivered/undeliverable somewhere for a week and a half now). . . ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* Never posted here, probably haven&amp;#39;t selected the right &amp;quot;flair&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;** I did add several screenshots (Images &amp;amp; Video tab), can&amp;#39;t see them anywhere now, though (post awaiting moderator approval).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit (11 hours after posting): Just wanted to thank everyone who commented, not being alone in this helped me feel a little better. But then I thought about pushing/poking/contacting them again and instantly felt like throwing up again. It would be so much better if my experience was the usual &amp;quot;weeks of no updates&amp;quot;. However, this BS shipment is now connected to MY RMA. (BTW, I, of course, don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s in the package, but it seems like &amp;quot;WD&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t know either.) I can already hear them telling me that they&amp;#39;ve already shipped &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; to me and it&amp;#39;s my fault that I didn&amp;#39;t receive it/pick it up, after I ask about the drive that was agreed upon on the 9th and 10th... not being able to comprehend what actually happened, just being stuck at &amp;quot;this is what&amp;#39;s in the system&amp;quot;, nobody from WD looking at it properly and thinking about it like a freaking human. Shouldn&amp;#39;t have to, but I&amp;#39;ll have to... Will update this in 4-8(?) days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** Let&amp;#39;s see if the screenshots can be added in a different way... ah, 1 image only here...

Still some apps won&amp;#39;t recognize the dB Power Amp rips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone experienced this as well? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I rely on tags, I can&amp;#39;t use WAV files. It has to be AIFF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love the speed of ripping five CDs at once, but if the resulting files are going to be finicky in some apps, then the speed boost is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5b6d7a04-b94e-11eb-b676-0ed4dfcb172d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "15qptq9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bratmix", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/15qptq9/aiff_files_ripped_by_db_power_amp_vs_xld/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/15qptq9/aiff_files_ripped_by_db_power_amp_vs_xld/", "subreddit_subscribers": 697932, "created_utc": 1692005452.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Seagate 8 TB 7200 RPM matchup: Ironwolf normal vs Pro vs NAS vs Pro NAS vs EXOS:\n\nWhat's the exact diff?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking to buy 2 new HDD to make my backups of my home data.\n\nCurrently, I have this backup setup, running on my old still-on-Windows7 PC with 8 GB RAM and using an old ASUS H81M-A MOBO (dating back from 2017, or maybe even earlier, I forgot!), with only PCIe 2.0, USB 2.0, and SATA 2.0. Yeah, upgrade overdue crisis, I know.\n\n\\- A pair of 5-years-old internal 3TB HDDs (WDC WD30 EZRS-0J99B0 SCSI). Those are still working reltively ok, but they are a bit \"slowpokes\".\n\n\\- An external 6 TB HDD WD \"Mybook\" HDD, which... only connects over USB 2.0 ! Even slower!\n\nI also use my PC for everything: gaming, creativity, and most of all, work. So data reliability is important. For work files, backups every few days, a bit over 100 GB each, keeping only about 1 TGB worth, backuping to both local backup drives and dedicated cloud storage over fast internet.\n\nIt worked all fine back when I had less than 3 TB of data, as my required pair of backups easily fit in the pair of internal HDDs. But now I have more data. Ergo the MyBook purchase... which was a bit of a letdown, honestly. And ever since, I basically have to \"split\" my data when doing my backups. The backups setup is \"wonky &amp; unwieldy\", and also... unbearably slooooooooow. Presently, if I get 50 MB/s backup speed, that's a great day! So doing full backup takes all week. So I am mostly trying to do it on weekends and nights, in little by litte parts. Else that slows down my workflow speed too much to my tastes: when windows is super busy copying zillion of files, opening or saving work files often becomes quite \"sluggish &amp; unresponsive\".\n\nAlso, when I try to copy everything in \"one go\", Windows \"chokes\" before the end of the backup, with a \"not enough memory\" error (or outright blue screen crashing). Gee whiz,  couldn't it just warn me it won't be able to do the entire job right after the files discovery step? Or splitting the entire copying job in smaller \"chunks\", all by itself? Maybe having 32 GB RAM would be enough? Or maybe Win10 already fixed that kind of problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm upgrading \\*everything\\*, PC and all. Replacing multiple smaller drives and single-use peripherals, to less numerous bigger drives &amp; multipurpose devices. Goodbye work desk and PC casing clutter!\n\nSearching the web, it feels like Seagate drives are slightly cheaper &amp; more reliable than WD, while WD seems to provide better support &amp; software? If that is the case, it is Seagate for me, all the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I saw those on Negegg today:\n\n\\- Seagate Ironwolf 8TB (ST8000VN004-NE) CMR 235$\n\n\\- Seagate Ironwolf 8TB NAS (ST8000VN0022) CMR 430$\n\n\\- Seagate Ironwolf Pro 8TB (ST18000NT001) CMR 290$CAD\n\n\\- Seagate Ironwolf Pro 8TB NAS (ST8000NE001) CMR 290$CAD\n\n\\- Seagate EXOS Enterprise 8TB (ST8000NM000A) 200$CAD\n\nAll of these are 7200RPM 8TB SATA 6.0GB/s drives. Not interested in the slower RPM drives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to understand what are all the \\*exact\\* differences between these, here? Especially between the non-NAS vs NAS versions, as they seem quite identical, with only a different label slaped on it lol? Cosmetic differences only? Different software? Accoustics insulation? I'm at a total loss here.\n\nAlso, why is the non-Pro \"non-NAS vs NAS\" price difference so big, while the Pro \"non-NAs vs NAS\" are both the exact same price? Weiiiiird.\n\nAnd why is the EXOS so much cheaper? Again, some newegg \"price fluke\", or a real reason? Maybe because it could possibly be PMR instead of CMR? Does PMR vs CMR make that huge of a difference? If it's because it's a little bit noisy, who cares, as it's only going to be used for occasionnal backups. As longs it's not noisy like \"years-1990s' clickety-ratchety ear-deafening HDD level of noisy\" lol. But if it is because it's much slower, that might be an issue, unless the speed difference isn't that big. This is because I'm really hoping to make my backups run \\*at least\\* 5 to 6 times times faster than before.\n\nAs I'm going to use these drives ONLY for doing some occasionnal \"full backups\" (definitely not more than once every month, maybe probably even only once or twice a year, albeit those will be huge FULL backups, though), do I really \"need\" the Pro versions, if the \\*only\\* visible difference is total-workload-lifetime durability? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I will ddefinitely splurge on however is my main data drive:\n\nAn 8TB M.2 PCI Gen4 SSD, for my main system &amp; main data files.\n\nStill not a lot of choices for that kind of SDD nowadays. Forget 16 TB SSDs: they are all way overpriced. As for PCI Gen 5, that is also still outta my budget. Anyway, I prefer to sacrifice a bit of performance, in order to use only technology that is fully mature, fully user tested, and fully debugged, stable tech for at least 1 or 2 years, and from reputable companies. Never gonna buy again extremely overpriced \"top-of-the-line\" stuff, that in fact requires you to play the guinea-pig doing the final product quality test phase in the company's place. Never gonna buy again stuff from weird-ass companies that lets you \"seemingly\" save 20% when you buy, but turns out to be 30% worse in all ways that really count.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinal question: If I forego the backup HDDs, but instead splurge on 8 TB internal \\*SATA\\* SSDs, what kind of backup speed upgrade would we be talking about? They're basically about a bit over twice the price of the HDDs, and a bit over half the price of a full-on M.2 SSD. But if that gives me ANOTHER 5-6 factor on full backups speed increase, that might turn out to be a very nice \"splurge\". Not sure it's really worth forking an extra 700$, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, any advice?
