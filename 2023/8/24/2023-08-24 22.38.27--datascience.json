Most of those experiences have been generally very positive. My latest company treated me pretty fairly, up until about 2 months ago when it became very clear what they are really like.\n\n\n- Mandatory social outings and extracurricular \"fun\" activities. For example, we were forced to go out to a park during the week and play soccer against another team in our department. Our manager showed up 40 minutes late and didn't even play. Just milled around, cheered our team on, and we lost.  Also had goofy t-shirts we were required to wear that said \"the eliminators\" or something like that\n\n\n- Tech stack extremely out of date and organization very siled. Some teams were very lucky to have Google BigQuery, and even though I had access to it, was often told I'm only allowed to use and create data sources in Microsoft Access, have to work exclusively out of Excel, have to be very very adept at using SQL, but I'm not allowed to create data tables in BigQuery, I have to do everything in legacy Microsoft Access because that's what the team is using and has used for many years, they're not able to or ready to transition into more modern data sources. We have Tableau, but we prefer to make everything in Excel. For example, using VBA to create tables repeatedly that could easily just be done in Tableau. Reinventing the entire wheel in Excel is absolutely insane\n\n\n- Manager was extremely lazy, unknowledgeable, unhelpful, and hardly ever did their job. This manager of course was included in the layoff, rightfully so. But the fact that they worked at the company for about 5 years is astounding to me. They would often schedule meetings and not even show up on time, arrive 20 minutes late, or they are driving in their car you can hear their turn signal, every single time, they have an excuse for why they are not doing their job during business hours. While you are sitting squarely at home being trustworthy independable, they are not doing their job. And their leaders were completely unaware of this for years? But they make it really hard for you to get promoted....\n\n\n- No in-role promotions. This was the first time I've ever heard of this in my life. I have never heard of a company that says you can't be promoted in the role that you are in. If you are an analyst, you can't possibly become a senior analyst. That's not possible. If you are senior analyst, you can't become the manager. A new entire role with different responsibilities has to be created by HR and you have to apply for it, compete against people throughout the company who probably aren't even in your department, you have like a 10% chance of getting hired into it, but likely you won't. So you're expected to stay in your job as long as possible even though they tell you after a year you can apply to other positions in the company, they frown upon that because they don't want turnover\n\n\n- Almost no yearly increase in salary. I was told that I was lucky, because as a hard worker, this year I was getting a 1.5% increase which is more than a lot of people were getting\n\n\n- No employee discount of any kind for the products that our company sells. Anytime this was brought up, the reason was that we get a bonus on top of that. Rivaling companies give discounts for their products, hours doesn't. So we have a 0% discount, and a bonus. But they sell it to us like we are so lucky to get this bonus, even though every single company offers a bonus\n\n\n- Laid off completely at random by our director, who read a message off a script in a monotone voice. Was told that I cannot apply to other positions as internal candidate, I would have to use the external career site and apply as if I am not an employee anymore, so in other words, follow the external applicant process. **They also laid off another person on my team who was pregnant and about to deliver a new child**. I considered myself very lucky. I found it extremely unprofessional, and downright evil that they would lay this person off Right before They are set to deliver a child. What kind of company could be so evil as to do that? There were other people on our team that were less qualified, and barely understood how to use Excel, and they chose someone who is extremely vulnerable and laid them off like that. Pretty crazy.... \n\n\n\n- Put me through a very rigorous application process like I am some random dude off the street. Admittedly, this is kind of normal I suppose, because they want to make sure they are making the right hiring decision. But some of the things I had to do and hoops I had to jump through were borderline insane. Take a full blown Excel test, take an SQL coding assignment, which is so weird because people in my previous department spoke to my skills and abilities. I was considered an expert in SQL, Python, Excel. So it was no mystery that I was extremely well versed in all of these things. Yet I had to do it anyway. \n\n\n- I was working remote previously, but this one is fully in office 5 days a week. No possibility to be remote. So now, I have to go from being fully remote to fully in office, costing me time, and resources, 10 hours a week in commuting back and forth completely erased from my life\n\n\n- After I provided my start date for the job that would be included on my offer letter, was contacted by HR and asked to start immediately, and gave me an extremely hard time about a trip that I had already planned for next week, flights, hotels, everything booked and paid for unable to be moved around. Their solution? I could take unpaid vacation to take the trip. What is the real reason you might ask that they have pushed my start date up so I have literally 3 days after getting the offer letter to start the job? **Because they would have to pay me out on my severance and then bring me back as a brand new employee.** \n\n- Overall lack of respect for their employees. Lay me off completely at random, put me through external hiring process like I'm a nobody even though I moved here for this company and job, then push my start date further without any care of consideration about what I have going on in my personal life\n\n\n- Company leaders are often in the news for a very negative reasons. For example, contributing to political action committees on behalf of the company for legislation that Is negatively targeting people of a certain ethnicity, extremely pro-conservative far right ideology throughout the entire company, and contributes financially to those sorts of political organizations. I personally am not going to voice my political opinions, but I'm just going to tell you right now, any company that contributes to political action committees with company funds, or the owners are very active and pushy and do that themselves is a really big red flag\n\n\n\n\nI honestly feel my skin crawl and just feel so wronged thinking back about the last 6 months with his company, even though the first year and a half with my team was actually generally pretty great, it just kind of traumatized me seeing how quick they were to throw people out of the company and then treat them like nothing, literal dirt, and then try and get them back in the company.
