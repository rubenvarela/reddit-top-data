How do I run it? what tests are there and how do they apply if your focus is on the data (DS) rather than the functions (SWE)? E.g. would you test a bunch of pandas transformations and if yes, how would you guarantee that a data edge case- like a df filled with zeroes - doesn&amp;#39;t break them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this video which has great explanations but it&amp;#39;s missing the hands-on part for learning:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/09etytJHHeY\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/live/09etytJHHeY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any hands-on resources that would be much appreciated.

They told me I would have to apply as an external applicant. Interviewed for about a dozen different positions, and as of a couple days ago, they finally made me an offer. But this was after another company I had applied to also offered me a job and I accepted and sign the offer letter Just to make sure I'm not homeless from running out of money.\n\nCompany A:\n\n* Senior data analysts at Fortune 500 retail company selling home products and physical goods\n* Laid me off completely at random with 30 other people, and offered no assistance finding another job within the company. Had to interview for a dozen different positions as an external applicant like I was some nobody off the street. During the hiring process, however, I got lots of great feedback and was told that everyone on my previous team really loved me, had great things to say, never heard anything negative about me. This put a bad taste in my mouth\n* Good company to build a career with, provided you're not laid off. Very stable, unchanging environment\n* 4 days in office, no possibility of remote work. Great office and very high tech\n* No discount or incentives offered for any products they sell\n* 6% bonus depending on company performance. Not guaranteed\n* Mandatory social outings outside business hours. For example, one time, we met at a local park and played soccer against another team under the same department on a Saturday. The directors were there, but disappeared after 5 minutes to go \"take a phone call\" and never came back. Manager also showed up 40 minutes late, then didn't even participate, so it was just us doing it against each other. They also made T-shirts with team names that we had to wear, ours was \"the exterminators\"\n* Tech systems stuck in the past. Many teams still use Excel exclusively to solve virtually everything even though they have Tableau, and they use Microsoft Access for databases\n* People were lazy and unmotivated, lacking innovation. lots of boomers who have no interest in innovating, are extremely under skilled and unwilling to learn. On my last team we hired someone who claimed they knew databases and SQL as well as master of Excel. Then called me every single week to ask me how to do a v-lookup. Lots of people incapable of figuring out how to do anything themselves. Whole company is like this from what I can tell.\n* Very conservative company run by boomers. Frequently in the news negatively for donating to rightwing political groups, and trying to control legislation, which puts them in a bad light. Not saying I agree or disagree here, just indicating the general nature of how they are perceived currently\n\nCompany B:\n\n* Senior analyst at Fortune 500 media and tech company selling fiber optic cable and wireless products\n* Three days in office with possibility to go fully remote in the future as flex\n* seemed to be extremely interested in me personally and treating me as a person. Was asked to choose between Lord of the rings and Star wars in the interview, which I found kind of fun and cool, like they cared about me as a person and valued fun\n* 100% discount on the services they offer like cable TV and internet, wireless, amounting to about $1,200 a year in savings. 6% bonus paid out quarterly or yearly\n* very progressive, innovative tech firm focused on learning, growth, collaborative development. Huge data science, analytics focus. It was clear that they were very very focused on learning, development of associates, having people learn\n* entire team is fully remote spread across several states, so no in-person outings or requirement to go play soccer or any of that.\n* software and technology used at this company is a bit more advanced. No combing through spreadsheets, no use of Microsoft Access. They use Tableau, Power BI, BigQuery, database systems\n\n**edit: Both positions offer same exact salary**", "author_fullname": "t2_hdeet8zsc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Need to choose from two different job offers.

They told me I would have to apply as an external applicant. Interviewed for about a dozen different positions, and as of a couple days ago, they finally made me an offer. But this was after another company I had applied to also offered me a job and I accepted and sign the offer letter Just to make sure I&amp;#39;m not homeless from running out of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company A:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Senior data analysts at Fortune 500 retail company selling home products and physical goods&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Laid me off completely at random with 30 other people, and offered no assistance finding another job within the company. Had to interview for a dozen different positions as an external applicant like I was some nobody off the street. During the hiring process, however, I got lots of great feedback and was told that everyone on my previous team really loved me, had great things to say, never heard anything negative about me. This put a bad taste in my mouth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Good company to build a career with, provided you&amp;#39;re not laid off. Very stable, unchanging environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4 days in office, no possibility of remote work. Great office and very high tech&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No discount or incentives offered for any products they sell&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6% bonus depending on company performance. Not guaranteed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mandatory social outings outside business hours. For example, one time, we met at a local park and played soccer against another team under the same department on a Saturday. The directors were there, but disappeared after 5 minutes to go &amp;quot;take a phone call&amp;quot; and never came back. Manager also showed up 40 minutes late, then didn&amp;#39;t even participate, so it was just us doing it against each other. They also made T-shirts with team names that we had to wear, ours was &amp;quot;the exterminators&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tech systems stuck in the past. Many teams still use Excel exclusively to solve virtually everything even though they have Tableau, and they use Microsoft Access for databases&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People were lazy and unmotivated, lacking innovation. lots of boomers who have no interest in innovating, are extremely under skilled and unwilling to learn. On my last team we hired someone who claimed they knew databases and SQL as well as master of Excel. Then called me every single week to ask me how to do a v-lookup. Lots of people incapable of figuring out how to do anything themselves. Whole company is like this from what I can tell.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very conservative company run by boomers. Frequently in the news negatively for donating to rightwing political groups, and trying to control legislation, which puts them in a bad light. Not saying I agree or disagree here, just indicating the general nature of how they are perceived currently&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company B:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Senior analyst at Fortune 500 media and tech company selling fiber optic cable and wireless products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Three days in office with possibility to go fully remote in the future as flex&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;seemed to be extremely interested in me personally and treating me as a person. Was asked to choose between Lord of the rings and Star wars in the interview, which I found kind of fun and cool, like they cared about me as a person and valued fun&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;100% discount on the services they offer like cable TV and internet, wireless, amounting to about $1,200 a year in savings. 6% bonus paid out quarterly or yearly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;very progressive, innovative tech firm focused on learning, growth, collaborative development. Huge data science, analytics focus. It was clear that they were very very focused on learning, development of associates, having people learn&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;entire team is fully remote spread across several states, so no in-person outings or requirement to go play soccer or any of that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;software and technology used at this company is a bit more advanced. No combing through spreadsheets, no use of Microsoft Access.
