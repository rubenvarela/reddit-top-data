Mainly because when you upload your data, you have to write glue code for every step, move the data, type the data, register the data. All this is quite tedious, error prone, and you all know how fun working with Athena schemas can be :)\n\nwell we added Athena to dlt, where you just pass your data to a function, and it gets turned into parquet, schema is managed with evolution, parquet goes to bucket, and then the table is registered in glue data catalog via athena api, properly typed and with clean data (like timestamps) :D\n\nThis new way of loading means you **don't have to munge files, structure them and deal with flakey types in Athena**. No more schema management pain! T**he schema is auto created on parquet and updated with evolution if needed**. And since it's AWS data catalog, you can read the data into many other destinations too!\n\nHere's an example of the code:\n\n    import dlt\n    \n    data = [{'id': 1, 'name': 'John'}]\n    \n    pipe = dlt.pipeline(destination='athena',\n                        dataset_name='raw_data')\n    \n    job_status = pipe.run(data,\n                          write_disposition=\"append\",\n                          table_name=\"users\")\n\ndlt is the first open source declarative python library for data loading and this week we add an athena destination\n\nUnder the hood, dlt will take your semi structured data such as json, dataframes, or python generators, auto converts it to parquet, load it to staging and register the table in glue data catalog via athena. Schema evolution included.\n\n# Question: What to add next? Iceberg tables? partitioning? please suggest what you need.

Mainly because when you upload your data, you have to write glue code for every step, move the data, type the data, register the data. All this is quite tedious, error prone, and you all know how fun working with Athena schemas can be :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;well we added Athena to dlt, where you just pass your data to a function, and it gets turned into parquet, schema is managed with evolution, parquet goes to bucket, and then the table is registered in glue data catalog via athena api, properly typed and with clean data (like timestamps) :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This new way of loading means you &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;#39;t have to munge files, structure them and deal with flakey types in Athena&lt;/strong&gt;. No more schema management pain! T&lt;strong&gt;he schema is auto created on parquet and updated with evolution if needed&lt;/strong&gt;.

I am seeing that a lot of my time is spent checking on issues of data in the lake as a lot of use cases are leveraging on data warehouse data. Those use cases that need warehouse data are first direct ingested to lake 1 to 1, then only transformed and entiched in data lake along with other source data to support dashboard, downstream application (e.g. campaign, customer self service portal), or used by data analysts and scientists.\n\nPersonally I feel this is bad design due to:\n1. Duplication of data between data warehouse and data lake\n2. Defeating the purpose of data warehouse modeling since we ingest to data lake again to support dashboard and reporting. \n3. Causing overhead in lake as there are expectation lake data must sync with data warehouse data with only tolerance of T-1 day. (While patching of historical data in warehouse can happen and is managed by other teams)\n4. More time lag of data to serve applications since going through more layers of systems\n\nI would appreciate your thoughts on:\n1. Is this normal practice across organization on this design decision? \n2.

I am seeing that a lot of my time is spent checking on issues of data in the lake as a lot of use cases are leveraging on data warehouse data. Those use cases that need warehouse data are first direct ingested to lake 1 to 1, then only transformed and entiched in data lake along with other source data to support dashboard, downstream application (e.g. campaign, customer self service portal), or used by data analysts and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I feel this is bad design due to:\n1. Duplication of data between data warehouse and data lake\n2. Defeating the purpose of data warehouse modeling since we ingest to data lake again to support dashboard and reporting. \n3. Causing overhead in lake as there are expectation lake data must sync with data warehouse data with only tolerance of T-1 day. (While patching of historical data in warehouse can happen and is managed by other teams)\n4. More time lag of data to serve applications since going through more layers of systems&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate your thoughts on:\n1.

I have several options on how to do it in my head, but can't decide which road to take. I'm hoping I can get some pointers here on someone with more experience would tackle this to get the ball rolling.\n\nThe current situation, which I didn't design, is that Fivetran is used to keep an exact copy of relevant Salesforce tables (objects) in Bigquery. If it sees a row is updated in Salesforce then Fivetran updates the row in BigQuery. This proces runs every 30 minutes or something like that.\n\nNaturally this makes it so that we have zero history for any of our dimensions. That's what I want to fix. I'm leaning towards just making daily snapshots of all the objects where I keep only relevant columns, and then also make daily snapshot intermediary tables based on those. Which in turn we will use to build aggregated views/tables that will be used for reports. Just because its simple to setup (I don't mind doing analytics on SCD2, but setting it up seems a lot harder and its harder to explain to others). By the way all of this will be done using Dataform. However, some of the objects/tables I want to snapshot are 1-3 million rows, which will rack up quickly if you have years of data.

When just making snapshots I would just union the historical snapshots made at the end of each day with the most current snapshot. How would I do that with SCD2? Change all enddates that are null in my historical set to today and then union the most current snapshot with a startdate of today and a null as enddate? \n\nAnother thing is that those bigger tables contain tasks or steps in a workflow. Each row represents a whole task or workflow and over time timestamp columns are filled on that row and the status field changes. It makes sense to pull a table like that apart right? Create a fact table with a timestamp and a status, and a dimension table with all the other information about that task or workflow like owner, account etc...
