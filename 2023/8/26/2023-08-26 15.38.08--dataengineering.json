I'm hoping I can get some pointers here on someone with more experience would tackle this to get the ball rolling.\n\nThe current situation, which I didn't design, is that Fivetran is used to keep an exact copy of relevant Salesforce tables (objects) in Bigquery. If it sees a row is updated in Salesforce then Fivetran updates the row in BigQuery. This proces runs every 30 minutes or something like that.\n\nNaturally this makes it so that we have zero history for any of our dimensions. That's what I want to fix. I'm leaning towards just making daily snapshots of all the objects where I keep only relevant columns, and then also make daily snapshot intermediary tables based on those. Which in turn we will use to build aggregated views/tables that will be used for reports. Just because its simple to setup (I don't mind doing analytics on SCD2, but setting it up seems a lot harder and its harder to explain to others). By the way all of this will be done using Dataform.

Change all enddates that are null in my historical set to today and then union the most current snapshot with a startdate of today and a null as enddate? \n\nAnother thing is that those bigger tables contain tasks or steps in a workflow. Each row represents a whole task or workflow and over time timestamp columns are filled on that row and the status field changes. It makes sense to pull a table like that apart right? Create a fact table with a timestamp and a status, and a dimension table with all the other information about that task or workflow like owner, account etc... I'm just not sure if I have an indicator in the table for each of the status steps for example.
