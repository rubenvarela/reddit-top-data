Posting this here as you guys have all encountered (I think) data governance in one form or another.\n\nSo, I'm a new data governance manager. I've been asked to review a separate project's business requirement documentation and their user manuals as well (it's a new application). I submitted my questions because there's information in those documents that are either missing or unclear. My clarifications for example are \"What would happen if there is an error\" because for the life of me, I don't understand why the author of these documents is under the assumption that everything will go well.\n\nNow I'm getting feedback from IT saying that my questions are for Audit rather than Data Governance.  I'm asking them to give me examples of which questions they mean, and they haven't gotten back to me.\n\nHas anyone here experienced something similar? And what do you think are \"Valid\" data governance questions when reviewing project or product requirements?\n\nEdit: I'm pretty sure that most of my questions are within the realm of DG or DG-adjacent.

I submitted my questions because there&amp;#39;s information in those documents that are either missing or unclear.

She could go for Computer Science but honestly I am not sure she would make it thought the program. She is good at math and is managing to do just OK in her programming class with a lot of tutoring from me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at the school she is going to and they have a Data Science program. It really does not look too hard. She already has the math from high school. She also has the only CS classes required, but I would suggest to her to repeat them. Then there are just 5 data science classes and a few electives to take. &lt;a href=\"https://datascience.uoregon.edu/undergraduate-program-degree-requirements\"&gt;Data Science program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems a lot easier then a CS degree, and I am not sure if this degree would not lead to just as many job offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My career has been client server applications so I am too much of a dinosaur to know if this is a good field. My wife is in this industry as a Data Science Product Manager and she thinks data science will become far less important and it will all be about machine learning in the future. But she might be biased from her work, and kind of always is excited about the latest thing so I am looking for some other opinions. ML programs look at least as hard as CS anyway, and few schools offer them for undergraduates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, does anyone have a Data Science degree? Or anyone here trying to hire someone with one? Whats the job outlook like?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "11w7vzz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NWOriginal00", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/11w7vzz/data_science_vs_computer_science_degree/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11w7vzz/data_science_vs_computer_science_degree/", "subreddit_subscribers": 859379, "created_utc": 1679284819.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
