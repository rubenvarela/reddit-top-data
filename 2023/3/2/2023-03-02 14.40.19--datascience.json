If this wasn't the case, I would probably directly apply to Masters programs. I didn't try very hard and actually started working full-time as a Data Analyst before I had even graduated with my Economics degree. Now I have 6 years of work experience going from intern to Senior DA (5 at a reputable company + 1 ongoing at a FAANG) and I would really like to work on a Masters degree. \n\nI did poorly in Economics, but I think I would do much better academically now that I am older and more mature and have worked with Data Science tools and techniques for so long. In the past 6 years while working full time I spent a ton of time on Udemy, Coursera and did dozens of courses that allowed me to pick up bigger projects at work. Everything I've learned about writing good code and statistical techniques and building performant models, I've either learned on the job from a willing mentor or from these kinds of certification courses. I love learning for the sake of 'immediately applying' what I learned and doing these kinds of Python projects in my spare time on weekends gives me a lot of passion. \n\nI recently discovered the EdX micromasters programs and realized that this might be a unique opportunity for me to add a stepping stone before applying to a Masters program. Has anyone had any experience with these? I think that doing a Micromasters + GRE could help overcome my bad undergraduate GPA in an MS application.\n\nIs trying my best to go get an MS the right path forward for me?

If this wasn&amp;#39;t the case, I would probably directly apply to Masters programs. I didn&amp;#39;t try very hard and actually started working full-time as a Data Analyst before I had even graduated with my Economics degree. Now I have 6 years of work experience going from intern to Senior DA (5 at a reputable company + 1 ongoing at a FAANG) and I would really like to work on a Masters degree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did poorly in Economics, but I think I would do much better academically now that I am older and more mature and have worked with Data Science tools and techniques for so long. In the past 6 years while working full time I spent a ton of time on Udemy, Coursera and did dozens of courses that allowed me to pick up bigger projects at work. Everything I&amp;#39;ve learned about writing good code and statistical techniques and building performant models, I&amp;#39;ve either learned on the job from a willing mentor or from these kinds of certification courses. I love learning for the sake of &amp;#39;immediately applying&amp;#39; what I learned and doing these kinds of Python projects in my spare time on weekends gives me a lot of passion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered the EdX micromasters programs and realized that this might be a unique opportunity for me to add a stepping stone before applying to a Masters program. Has anyone had any experience with these?
