After my studies, I began working as a data scientist in  healthcare in a small French company (&lt;40 people). It was nice and I  learned a lot of things during these 3.5 years, but now my job is  depressing, here are the pros and cons :\n\npros :\n\n* nice colleagues (except the manager). We go out every Friday night and sometimes we go ski together :)\n* interesting data studies (but no work since mid 2022...) and models\n* not that far from my place\n* hybrid work\n\ncons :\n\n* toxic management that led me to an unfortunate work situation besides being performant\n* bored out because we're waiting for new projects to arrive and they  won't start until 2024 -&gt; I've been doing almost nothing at work  these past 10 months and it's really starting to be annoying! Going to  an open space and doing random projects that no one will never use is  depressing, I feel like I could really improve in another environment.\n* I mostly spend my days wondering what I can do to help, and even my manager doesn't know exactly what I could do since it's \"my responsibility to find something meaningful to do\"\n* low tier salary\n\nThat's  why I decided to switch jobs and I quit 1 week ago. I could deal with a  toxic boss but having nothing to do at work during more than 12 months  is depressing for someone as proactive and motivated as I am! I feel like I'm losing time to develop skills and my career.\n\nI found a new job in healthcare in a huge company (&gt;10k employees). The job looks really cool:\n\n* Super interesting studies on international databases\n* It's in healthcare and it's meaningful for me\n* I love the technical stack (Python, Dask, working with cloud providers, doing end to end analysis with nice tools...)\n* I will have more \"technical responsibilities\" and that's something I really wish I had in my previous experience\n* High salary. For my age &amp; my location, it's definitely a top tier salary I never know I could have before my 35s in France\n* Since it's a huge company, there is room to be promoted and gain responsibilities, maybe also relocate in different cities such as Paris or London if I want to move elsewhere\n\nI'm sure this job will help me in my career because it will help me gain valuable skills in an industry I like.\n\nThe  only thing is: this job is 100% remote. The team is spread across  Europe and I will wfh. It's something I already do, and I enjoy it quite  a lot even if we're restricted to 2 days / week in my current job, but  during the pandemic I felt like it was overwhelming.\n\nHowever,  the situation was different because I was in a really small appartment,  with no sunlight and I couldnt go out for 3 months. Now I'm in a more  spacious appartement: the living room is big and I have a dedicated  workstation I only use to work, there are big windows and it's in a city  center so near almost everything, I think I can be really comfortable.  When I wfh, it feels nice and I can be productive. I also develop  websites at night and I'm a musician, so I work a lot at home and it  feels natural to me to sit at my desk and work on projects.\n\nI'm  still scared about the full remote aspect of the job, and I think I  would have regretted if I didnt accept it because the job looks really  nice and is exactly what I want to do in my career. Also, having this experience on my resume will help me land really nice jobs in the future or internal opportunities.\n\nI am preparing, and looking for options to feel good and enjoy this new life. My current actions are :\n\n* Start tennis lessons again, 1h30 every week at night to make new friends and workout\n* Plan to meet my freelancer friends &amp; work with them\n* Visit coworking spaces: I think it can really help me break the routine  and meet new people and there are tons of coworking spaces around me. I  also contacted the recruiter to know if people working in my city  already work in dedicated coworking spaces sometimes (waiting for his  answer). I also feel like it wouldnt be that much different from my  current job since we have flex offices and I just sit at a desk all day,  book rooms to attend Teams meetings, eat with collegues and then go  back to my desk until the end of the day, it's already like a coworking  space\n* Improve my workstation and buy a really nice chair, add plants...\n\nI  think I can enjoy the job since the description fits my aspirations but  I want to make sure I won't be depressed 2 months after starting it! Also, I have a gf and many friends in my city, so I have a social life outside of work.\n\n**My question is: Do you have tips to enjoy full remote work, and which advice would you give to me?**\n\nThanks &amp; have a nice day", "author_fullname": "t2_1suwfq18", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Switching to a remote data scientist job that looks like a dream job: I'm nervous about working remotely and looking for tips!", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_11ixq8e", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1678024547.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  have an engineering degree from a French school and currently living in  France.
