It is becoming a way of life. I want to upgrade my methods to make it the best it can be.\n\n1. I use Ubuntu with an ext4 file system.  \n2. I have a 40TB archive, backed up to another 40TB, with 20TB unused in the wings, and I need at least another 8TB drive to replace a failing one. I have 32 drives total.\n3. I am presently reorganizing things, and questioning my practices. I want specific feedback on dealing with so many harddrives, and how to organize such a large collection and potentially growing.\n4. Finally I want to know what hardware I need to host a 16TB (max) subset of my collection on the web or on torrents, or whatever.\n\n## A. Hardware\n\nI'm in the middle of a major reorganization task. I've got 100TB in play, 40 storing, 40 backup, 10/10 presently unused. My method so far has been good enough for personal use. I keep a master drive, and a backup drive. Every once in a while, maybe every couple months or after a year, depending on my mood, I backup the master onto the backup. I use a duplication bay for that purpose. \n\nMy drives are usually offline, unless I'm using them for something. This means less of a convenience factor. But I am not interested in hosting *these* drives on any cloud, or on a plex server, or streaming to phones. I might, however, like a solution that keeps more of my data more active for personal use, like movies and music. Other data doesn't need to be online so much.\n\nMy backups are at another location, for security reasons. So I've got a 1/1 system, with built-in offsite, rather than a 2/1 that is widely suggested.\n\n### Duplication Bays vs Raid\n\nRight now I'm using a single dual-bay duplicator. That means at most I can host 2 drives. To be honest, I'm not 100% happy with the duplicators out there. I feel a lot of computer hardware is remarkably trash. I try to buy the best quality external drive bays, for example, and end up getting burned. Simple things like power connections being inconsistent, or having to fiddle with USB cables, kind of gets me down. That's why I prefer my duplication bay. My previous duplication bays became faulty, but I didn't lose much data. Still, is this the only solution, swapping drives endlessly?\n\nRecently I found one of my 8TB drives lost its plastic SATA pin cover to a faulty (and tossed) duplication bay. It makes me more anxious about playing with the drives. I would prefer a system whereby I plug drives in once and leave them.\n\nOne reason I've been resistant to RAID with multiple harddrives is that I maintain a security policy on a drive by drive basis. Some drives are private and encrypted. Some are private and unencrypted. Some are public and shareable. I'm not sure how to sort that out via RAID, except by creating separate RAID solutions for each use case, of which there are 6. I assume that would be prohibitive, and run against what I assume to be the purpose of RAID, which is pilling more and more drives into a single system. \n\nI'm also concerned that having both all the masters and backups in the same electrical system could result in a total loss of data, should the electrical system fault. \n\n**Question: Should I just get two bigger duplication bay, one with 5 bays, one device for my masters and one for my backups?**  \n**Question: Or does it make sense to setup multiple RAID solutions, even for drives as small as 4TB?**\n\n### Issue: Keeping Track of Drives\n\nI've gotten to the point where the number of drives, their purposes, status, health, etc, has reached almost unmanageable proportions. It's not just about my archival drives, but all the drives across numerous computers. Typically I gather data on these computers, then transfer them to the appropriate master drive at some point, which is then backed up. So there are a lot of drives in play, 32 to be exact. I'm not sure how many more drives I can keep in my head and keep track of. I have maintained a list, but it is getting so big I practically forget the beginning by the time I get to the end.\n\n**Question: How do you keep track of so many drives?**\n\n### Issue: Tracking Drive Health\n\nAlthough I haven't had many drive issues in the past few years, and none of them fatal, I hadn't really started doing SMART checks on my drives until recently. Mostly the news is good, but there were a few surprises, and I will have to replace one or two smaller drives in this housekeeping phase.\n\n**Question: What do you do to check your drive health?**  \n**Question: How often do you do things like SMART checks?**  \n**Question: What is your rule about acting on results from SMART checks? When do you give up on a drive?**\n\n### Issue: Prices and Availability\n\nI am not located in the United States, and I don't necessarily have access to the latest gadget, and certainly not at the same price. So a lot of the suggestions thrown around here are a bit out of my league. Probably the most available commodity solution is the one that will be available to me, rather than the more rare, homebrew solution.\n\n### Issue: Electrical Power Reliability\n\nThe second issue is that the power system in my country is unreliable. For years I lost computers and harddrives without really figuring out that a power strip wasn't going to be enough. I have invested heavily in external backup power supplies (APC), and I haven't had any serious computer issues since. Nevertheless, I continue to feel a bit anxious about any solution that would be up and running 24/7. I wonder if it would be possible to keep them up safely. \n\nTo give you one idea, one year back a transformer blew, sending a spark into my electrical meter. Luckily none of my devices were disturbed, but the main wire was completely fried and I lost power for most of the day before an electrician came. The electrical meter had to be replaced as well. This is the reality of my situation, and it makes me cautious.\n\n**Question: Any thoughts on how to manage data storage under conditions of unreliable power?**\n\n### Issue: Web Hosting Solution\n\nHaving said that, I have recently become interested in hosting some of my collection online on a publicly accessible server, maybe on the web or for torrents. For the sake of argument, let's say it's two 8TB drives, backed up, so 32TB total. Uptime reliability isn't that important, for reasons I have just given. But I'm not sure serving files from drives in a duplication bay is the preferred option. \n\n**Question: What is the ideal solution for hosting a small collection (16TB max) on a webserver?**  \n**Question: How would I backup two 8TB drives while they were spinning live on a web service? Like, I cannot take them offline to do backups, so how is it done?**\n\n## B. Library\n\nHaving poked my head in here a few times over the years, it appears there is no single consistent system for organizing large volumes of data. Each datahoarder whips up a home brew solution based on their specific requirements.\n\n### How I Presently Organize My Data: the File System\n\nPresently my method of organization consists of separation across drives into topic/security policy. On each drive, data is separated into hierarchical directories. I don't use any tagging system, or additional software. Occasionally I add notes or other indications into the filename, which helps in search. \n\nWhile this has worked for me so far, I'm afraid it may not work for me much longer. Over the past 2 and a half years I have accumulated about 8TB of data from various sources, which are very mixed in nature. They include torrents of music and movies, Youtube and Twitter archives, books and articles, and lots and lots of web ephemera, including intricate, multi-week gatherings of news events. \n\nAt this point I am very anxious to organize what I have, rather than collect more. And I want to make the right choices about that.\n\n### Consideration: Longevity\n\nOne reason why I'm partial to organizing on file system is that access does not require any third party software. Tagging systems are fine, but they are not native to the OS. \n\nI'm also afraid of committing to systems with lock in, that will go out of style, or become inoperable in a few years due to developer disinterest. What am I supposed to do with a database I've built that is no longer readable?\n\nMy preference would be an ASCII text-file based system, because those are eternal. 7 bits will never die. I don't care much about speed or other conveniences. \n\n### Hard Constraint: Must be a Local Solution\n\nI don't subscribe to the in-browser, javascript, or cloud-based, or online system. I don't log in to websites and hand over metadata of my collection to corporations. I don't submit my personal photos to artificial intelligence or facial scanning. I am a digital recluse who does not partake in social media. (You will note this is the first post of an entirely new account.)  The purpose of an *archive* is security first and foremost. It should never even touch a networked computer, much less make use of grotesque network services. (Edit: for example, [Picard](https://picard-docs.musicbrainz.org), which sends fingerprints and metadata of local files to a centralized server.) *Everything must be done on the local machine, and should work on a machine with no networking.* \n\nI make an exception in the web hosting use case, but that is only because that collection will be (a) heavily curated and excluding private material, and (b) hosted on separate drives, thus not at all endangering my original, permanent archive. The possibility of reliable curation will, of course, depend upon whether the collection can be organized at all. \n\nIt would be preferable that the principles of organization of the original archive could be adapted to the purpose of publication on a web service, rather than having to reorganize the subset collection using an entirely different organizational scheme. \n\nGiven the above, please tell me what you advise to organize\n0. Everything in one go, if you have any proposals  \n1. Music    \n2. Movies  \n3. Books  \n4. Websites, news pages  and other web ephemera, including photos and memes **&lt; this is the hardest one**  \n5. Web site archives and mirrors  \n6. Personal photos and home movies  \n7. Personal ephemera, like bills and banking information  \n\nThank you.", "author_fullname": "t2_w9xexp5o", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "32 Drives. 100TB Total Drive Space.

I have invested heavily in external backup power supplies (APC), and I haven&amp;#39;t had any serious computer issues since. Nevertheless, I continue to feel a bit anxious about any solution that would be up and running 24/7. I wonder if it would be possible to keep them up safely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give you one idea, one year back a transformer blew, sending a spark into my electrical meter. Luckily none of my devices were disturbed, but the main wire was completely fried and I lost power for most of the day before an electrician came. The electrical meter had to be replaced as well. This is the reality of my situation, and it makes me cautious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Any thoughts on how to manage data storage under conditions of unreliable power?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Issue: Web Hosting Solution&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I have recently become interested in hosting some of my collection online on a publicly accessible server, maybe on the web or for torrents. For the sake of argument, let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s two 8TB drives, backed up, so 32TB total. Uptime reliability isn&amp;#39;t that important, for reasons I have just given. But I&amp;#39;m not sure serving files from drives in a duplication bay is the preferred option. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: What is the ideal solution for hosting a small collection (16TB max) on a webserver?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Question: How would I backup two 8TB drives while they were spinning live on a web service? Like, I cannot take them offline to do backups, so how is it done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;B. Library&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having poked my head in here a few times over the years, it appears there is no single consistent system for organizing large volumes of data. Each datahoarder whips up a home brew solution based on their specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How I Presently Organize My Data: the File System&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Presently my method of organization consists of separation across drives into topic/security policy. On each drive, data is separated into hierarchical directories. I don&amp;#39;t use any tagging system, or additional software. Occasionally I add notes or other indications into the filename, which helps in search. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While this has worked for me so far, I&amp;#39;m afraid it may not work for me much longer. Over the past 2 and a half years I have accumulated about 8TB of data from various sources, which are very mixed in nature. They include torrents of music and movies, Youtube and Twitter archives, books and articles, and lots and lots of web ephemera, including intricate, multi-week gatherings of news events. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I am very anxious to organize what I have, rather than collect more. And I want to make the right choices about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Consideration: Longevity&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One reason why I&amp;#39;m partial to organizing on file system is that access does not require any third party software. Tagging systems are fine, but they are not native to the OS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also afraid of committing to systems with lock in, that will go out of style, or become inoperable in a few years due to developer disinterest. What am I supposed to do with a database I&amp;#39;ve built that is no longer readable?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My preference would be an ASCII text-file based system, because those are eternal. 7 bits will never die. I don&amp;#39;t care much about speed or other conveniences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Hard Constraint: Must be a Local Solution&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t subscribe to the in-browser, javascript, or cloud-based, or online system. I don&amp;#39;t log in to websites and hand over metadata of my collection to corporations. I don&amp;#39;t submit my personal photos to artificial intelligence or facial scanning. I am a digital recluse who does not partake in social media. (You will note this is the first post of an entirely new account.)  The purpose of an &lt;em&gt;archive&lt;/em&gt; is security first and foremost. It should never even touch a networked computer, much less make use of grotesque network services. (Edit: for example, &lt;a href=\"https://picard-docs.musicbrainz.org\"&gt;Picard&lt;/a&gt;, which sends fingerprints and metadata of local files to a centralized server.) &lt;em&gt;Everything must be done on the local machine, and should work on a machine with no networking.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I make an exception in the web hosting use case, but that is only because that collection will be (a) heavily curated and excluding private material, and (b) hosted on separate drives, thus not at all endangering my original, permanent archive. The possibility of reliable curation will, of course, depend upon whether the collection can be organized at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be preferable that the principles of organization of the original archive could be adapted to the purpose of publication on a web service, rather than having to reorganize the subset collection using an entirely different organizational scheme. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the above, please tell me what you advise to organize\n0. Everything in one go, if you have any proposals&lt;br/&gt;\n1. Music&lt;br/&gt;\n2. Movies&lt;br/&gt;\n3. Books&lt;br/&gt;\n4. Websites, news pages  and other web ephemera, including photos and memes &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt; this is the hardest one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n5. Web site archives and mirrors&lt;br/&gt;\n6. Personal photos and home movies&lt;br/&gt;\n7.
