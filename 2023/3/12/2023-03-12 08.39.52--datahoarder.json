A little noobish on the hardware side of things, but not too hopeless.\n\nI tinkered with setting up an OMV NAS on a Raspberry Pi 4, which worked great until I tried using Docker on it and it crapped out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are my options, as I understand them now:\n\n1. Buy a dedicated NAS box, such as Synology or Asustor or QNAP, or one of the many others offered.\n2. Convert my current PC to NAS + home media device + general purpose server.\n3. Convert my current PC to only one or two of those things and still get a dedicated NAS box to do the other things.\n\nNow each of those options poses additional questions, which I hope the esteemed Elders of the Hoard would be able to answer.\n\nBefore you send me to Google - I googled, binged, and duckduckgoed all over the place. A lot of information seems outdated or fake (shilled by \"influencers\" who say no evil about the product they are paid to ~~praise~~ review). A lot of questions were not answered. A lot of answers were not specific enough. And it's always nice to get the opinions of people actually using the things they are talking about.\n\nBefore you send me to r/NAS \\- That subreddit is dedicated to the rapper, not the Network Attached Storage.\n\nIf you are unable to answer all of the questions, please answer what you can. I labeled the questions for ease of responding.\n\n**0. Which approach would you recommend and why?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. Getting a dedicated NAS box.**\n\n1.A - Which one should I get?\n\n* I hear people swear by Synology, but their recent move to shill their own drives concerns me.\n* Asustor seems nice but I found some online reviews indicating hit-and-miss experience with the hardware.\n* QNAP appears to have a pretty lousy reputation, but the older testimonies could be outdated and QNAP could have upped their game.\n* I have not considered others, but if there are good options to consider let me know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.B - How big of a unit should I get?\n\n* Bigger units are rather expensive but are more economical with RAID5/RAID6 setups.\n* Smaller units are cheaper but RAID will eat up a large percentage of storage.\n* Is there a good middle ground? Or should I go for the big one and save in the long run on additional storage?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.C - Expansion units - yay or nay?\n\n* All three of my potential options offer expansion units. Is it better to buy a larger main unit and not need to expand or a smaller unit and use expansion units with it as needed?\n* Are these expansion units proprietary? If the main unit craps out, can I still use the expansion unit as a plug-in Direct-Attached Storage (DAS)? If my main unit suffers a data loss, (like if I lost 2 of RAID 5 drives at the same time, for example) is the expansion unit affected?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.D - Data integrity.\n\n* If the unit craps out but the drives are still good, am I able to transfer data from the drives somehow?\n* If I buy, say, Synology, it dies, and I don't want to buy another one, can I make the drives work with, say, Asustor without losing data?\n* Which RAID to go with? I'm considering RAID 6 as a good compromise between redundancy and maximizing volume, but I'm open to the pros of other RAID options and cons of this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.E - Which drives to get and how to get them?\n\n* It is my understanding that CMR is the way to go and SMR is to be avoided due to RAID rebuild issues and whatnot. Is this still the case? Can I use CMR and SMR drives together in one RAID array?\n* My other understanding is that it is possible to use drives of different sizes in one RAID array, it's just that the array will be built as if all of the drives were the capacity of the smallest drive. So if I had \\[20, 20, 18, 20\\], it would be interpreted as \\[18, 18, 18, 18\\]. What happens if one of the drives fails in RAID5/6 and I am unable to get the same drive size? Would it be worthwhile (or even possible) to shove a smaller drive in there while I wait for the larger drive? Or should I begin the process of exporting immediately?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.F - Which OS to use?\n\n* I think all of the NAS boxes come with their own operating systems. If I don't like the experience, can I install something else on them? Is it a worthwhile endeavor or a waste of time due to the tight integration of hardware and software?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Converting my current PC to NAS + home media server + general purpose server.**\n\n2.A - Which OS to use?\n\n* It is currently running Win10 and is not eligible for a Win11 upgrade. Can I just keep using Win10\n* Should I use Unraid/TrueNAS?\n* Should I just go with some regular Linux distro due to the fact that it will be multi-purpose?\n* Which one is best for RAID? Is RAID even practical for a converted build?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.B - If it's not a dedicated NAS device, should I be using NAS drives or keep to regular drives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.C - Should I do any adjustments to the internals of it? Add things/remove things/beef up things?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Converting my current PC to only one of the things I want.**\n\n3.1 If I am unable to convert my current PC to a combo device, why not, and what should I convert it to instead?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.2 How should I get the thing I wasn't able to get out of my old PC? Convert and still buy a NAS box, or perhaps build two computers this year, one dedicated to being a NAS and another for general-purpose computing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all in advance for reading this post and providing your helpful suggestions.\n\nEdit: I want to specify that if I am going with option 2 I plan to be updating the HDDs to more drives of larger capacity (\\~20 TB per).", "author_fullname": "t2_474xm0ze", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Need help getting to my first NAS.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_11ovkdr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1678576604.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1678569881.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Elders of the Hoard!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized that I need a NAS.

I'm currently looking into iCloud to cover all the Apple devices. Still a sync-based solution, but it can be paired with occasional iTunes backups and photo downloads so it's not the worst option. If anyone has any advice on a more user-friendly system to keep Apple devices backed up outside of iCloud, it would be greatly appreciated. \n\n2. Because One Drive is a sync software, it doesn't provide the consistent protection that our PC's need and often creates duplicates or holes in data if it doesn't have time to properly sync. It also involves managing several different accounts and the associated devices individually. Plus, it's only partially compatible with Apple products. So, I'm looking at moving away from One Drive and searching for a better backup plan that's a little more comprehensive and a little less hands-on.

I need something that does full backups and keeps up with them consistently, without a lot of intervention from my parents on their end. \n\n- I've heard a lot about people getting confused over how Backblaze functions and losing tons of data. I essentially want copies, not a sync service. I don't want things getting deleted too soon (I could pay for the 1-year extensions but that's not foolproof). I just want plain and simple copies of the data to be stored in the cloud and recoverable in case something happens. I've heard that Backblaze \"B2\" can create \"snapshots\" that can be stored and recovered, but again, I don't know much about the company or how it backs up data. B2 is a slightly more expensive solution than regular Backblaze but it could be closer to what I'm looking for. Overall, I liked that Backblaze didn't need a ton of maintenance.\n\n- As for Macrium Reflect, I know even less. They no longer offer their free version but $58 for a lifetime license seems reasonable. From what I understand so far, it's a good system for cloning drives, but I don't quite understand its backup system and if it would be a usable system for my parents. \n\n3. The last issue is external drives. With Windows 11 moving away from its old backup systems and trying to push people into One Drive, backing up to externals has become more of a pain. File History is \"okay\" but similar to System Images, it seems to be getting phased out. Not sure if Macrium Reflect fills that void? It would be nice to have a quick way to get file backups or the occasional System Image over to an external drive without too much issue. (Again, ease of use, or at least an easy walkthrough for those with less tech experience.)\n\nThe bottom line is I don't like any data being held hostage or getting accidentally corrupted by cloud services.

Verbatim M-Discs have only been produced since 2015. &lt;a href=\"https://www.verbatim.fi/fi/article/history-of-verbatim/\"&gt;https://www.verbatim.fi/fi/article/history-of-verbatim/&lt;/a&gt;. So we have to wait until 2030 to see if they start to exceed the typical ~15 year lifespan of non-MDisc media. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe to M-Disc because it&amp;#39;s only been around since 2009, so at least another year before it hits the typical real-world max of ~15 years for none M-Disc media. If they start failing, the patent holder can just say; &amp;quot;Oops, our bad!&amp;quot; and shut down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Verbatim is already tapping as discussed in this thead: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/111q0vh/verbatim_has_been_marketing_cheaper_bluray_blanks/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/111q0vh/verbatim_has_been_marketing_cheaper_bluray_blanks/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*CMC Magnetics owns the rights to Verbatim&amp;#39;s proprietary AZO formula, which along with Taiyo-Yuden formula (maybe: &lt;a href=\"https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/389210-CMC-manufacturing-Taiyo-Yuden-DVDs\"&gt;https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/389210-CMC-manufacturing-Taiyo-Yuden-DVDs&lt;/a&gt;) discs are the only 1st tier writable DVD media left today.
