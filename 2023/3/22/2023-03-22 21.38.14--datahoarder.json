I didn't get any replies but I did get upvotes, so I'm guessing no one really knew, but people might be interested to know how it turned out.\n\nThe short version is, yes, I got it working, YAY!\n\nThe longer version of what went right and wrong could be useful for others who are working through any version of this in the future. (Potentially including me, long after I've forgotten it all!) The longer version goes like this.\n\n**First challenge: Getting an interface.** My understanding of these drives is they all shipped as standard with a SAS connector, but HP also sold a fibre channel (FC) upgrade kit - the only evidence of which I can find is a couple of old supplier listings. Now, if my drive is anything to go by, the kit seems to be designed for professional installer use (maybe even HP's own people) and is destructive to the SAS connector. (Part of the connector is visible, but you can't attach to it). I don't believe it's possible to \"un-kit\" it and go back to SAS. So I had to get a FC card. \n\nHP does publish compatibility information for the tape drives, but they don't cover FC cards (this is probably an inclusion with the FC upgrade kit doco which is nowhere to be found online). So I was shooting in the dark. But I figured a HP branded one had the best odds of being compatible. So I picked up a \"HP / QLOGIC QLE2560-HP 8GB SINGLE PORT F/CARD w/ SFP P/N: 489190-001, 584776-001\" off eBay, and got lucky first try - it was compatible with both the drive and my system.\n\n**Side note about my system:** I bought a system specifically to run this drive and other home file sharing and backup tasks, and I got a refurbished HP Z420, a high-end-in-2012 business workstation listed as compatible with the HP tape drives. It came with an upgraded i7 CPU, budget-gaming NVIDIA graphics card, and SSD/HDD, intended as a budget gaming machine. It was AUD$350 or so. I suspect this choice allowed me to bypass a lot of issues around compatibility with the drive and the FC card, although it did create other challenges, see below.\n\n**Second challenge: Installing in the case.** First I had to remove the rack sleeve surrounding the tape drive. This was screwed on, but also had cable connectors, at least one of which was really tough, so I wound up having to slide it out as far as the cables would let it, and then bend the back panel open to get it free of the cables from behind. There's also an ethernet connection on my rack sleeve that I think is used in server settings to communicate directly with the drive to troubleshoot.\n\nNext, I had to install the drive in the Z420 case. You can only use the top two 5.25\" bay slots, because any lower has the back hitting the memory. The Z420 has a system of tracks and large screws that slot in to the tracks. They actually give you spare screws, screwed into the side of the rack, but unless you know what they are, they look like part of the rack and it seems like there is no way to secure anything. (The Z420 has one side of the case riveted in place so you can only use their system to secure things each side - or, of course, get a new case). It was one of those things that was easy once you knew the trick, but took a ridiculous amount of angst to solve.\n\n**Third challenge: Cable connection between tape drive and FC card.** Let me save you some angst here and explain that the cable needed is an LC-LC multimode/duplex fibre patch cable. LC is the connector type, multimode and duplex means the signals can travel in both directions, patch means (in this context) that both ends are male. Single mode tends to be a yellow cable and multimode is blue/aqua (but I wouldn't choose on colour alone). Because FC interfaces aren't aimed at consumers, it's not particularly simple to find any of this out. Also, the FC upgrade kit used to add fibre to HP drives installed two FC connectors, but only one of them worked - not sure if this is normal/firmware controlled/something or one was just broken. Regardless, when I was troubleshooting, changing ports got me further in. Also, the FC card only has a port on the outside, so I had to send the FC cable out by removing one of the PCI card cover plates and plug it in there. Fortunately my FC cable is a metre long so it was long enough to do this. Also, these cables have standards OM1, OM2, OM3, etc - completely irrelevant for this purpose. The standard relates to how far apart the devices can be, and they're all much longer than will happen in a single case, even a rackmount case. The cables come with little white protective covers on each end \"pin.\" If you plug it in with the covers still on, it will go in partway but not lock in. That's your clue that you need to take them off.\n\n**Fourth challenge: Getting my system to use the FC card.** This part was easy. The Device Manager saw the FC card immediately and showed it with a warning icon (you may need to use Show Hidden Devices to see it). I had to manually find and install drivers for it to accept it fully. Piece of cake. The main thing to know about FC cards is that underneath the hardware, they use ethernet protocols to communicate. So don't worry like I did when you see references to networking and ethernet - Windows has not misidentified the card.\n\n**Fifth challenge: Getting my system to see the drive.** Getting my system to see the drive was pretty easy. Once I'd installed drivers for the FC card, the tape drive showed up in Device Manager straight away with a question mark, which means you need to do more stuff to make it fully ready for use. The \"do more stuff\" means manually tracking down and installing drivers.\n\n**Sidenote on what happened next:** I had made a mistake a few steps back - I had a unidrectional rather than duplex FC cable in place. This created a horrendous half-working situation that kept me trying things for weeks. Various pieces of software could read data from the drive fine (eg, extracting information about the drive), but all software would crash when I tried to send info the other way (eg tape quality tests, which write data, or create a drive mapping). At this point the tape drive would turn into a hidden device in Device Manager, that is, Device Manager saw it as disconnected - not sure if the tape drive was reacting to the failed attempt and disconnecting, or Windows was doing it as some sort of fault detection/attempt at error correction.\n\nMy research in trying to solve this sent me ALL around the virtual world. I tried drivers and utilities and software from anyone who ever co-branded these drives (including Quantum, IBM, and Dell), I got a lead in archived forum discussions that Windows 10 support was initially buggy, so I installed dual-boot Windows 8.1 only to have the same problem, so then I installed Linux as well. (My machine is now triple boot). At some point a second FC cable I'd ordered arrived (I'd gotten impatient so I'd ordered one with faster shipping) and I noticed the difference in labelling and colour. I thought about it and realised that the communication was always from PC drive to the drive when it crashed, so I tried the new cable and the drive worked just fine in Windows 10. Then I did some more reading on FC cables and reverse-engineered an understanding of what was happening here. (I will have to decide at some point whether I have any need for the other two OS, but that's a decision for another day).\n\n**Sixth challenge: Getting the tape drive to be useful.** For my use case, what I really wanted was LTFS, which is something that started with LTO5 which lets you mount a tape as a \"drive\" and lets you interact with it like you would any other drive. The required component for this is LTFS. Now, HP's tape tools utilities includes LTFS, but it doesn't really say so, you only find this out by digging in to the underlying files. Because I was scrambling to figure out my problem with communicating the drive, I was looking for this separately. I could find other brands' LTFS, but it didn't solve my problem, so I thought there was a missing piece. There wasn't, but it took me a long time to figure that out. \n\nOne thing that is really useful, though, is an LTFS configuring utility. I've lost track of whose one I'm using at this point, but IBM and Quantum both have standalone utilities for this, and what it does it create a drive mapping. If your backups routines revolve around command line scripts as mine do, that's probably all you need to make your drive useful.\n\nEarly tape drive usage was very reliant on cataloguing. Your backup would include external cataloguing so you could find content again, there was no ability to show an index from the tape itself. The change made in LTO5 that made using it as a regular drive possible was a system to catalogue the file list on the tape. It's not necessarily fast, but it is there.\n\nAt this point we're getting beyond my use case, but just to fill in a bit further, if you do need a backup solution with cataloguing capabilities, most are paid, and priced for commercial use. But there is one free option, Bacula Community Edition. This thing is a bastard to figure out on your own, but there are a few videos on YouTube that make it much easier to understand what the hell it's doing and how to use it. That would be my suggested first stop if you're looking to add a solution on top for older pre-LTO5 systems (or later if your system is big enough to warrant cataloguing).\n\nSo that's what I know at the end of my little adventure. I hope it's useful for other people on adventures of their own.

So I picked up a &amp;quot;HP / QLOGIC QLE2560-HP 8GB SINGLE PORT F/CARD w/ SFP P/N: 489190-001, 584776-001&amp;quot; off eBay, and got lucky first try - it was compatible with both the drive and my system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side note about my system:&lt;/strong&gt; I bought a system specifically to run this drive and other home file sharing and backup tasks, and I got a refurbished HP Z420, a high-end-in-2012 business workstation listed as compatible with the HP tape drives. It came with an upgraded i7 CPU, budget-gaming NVIDIA graphics card, and SSD/HDD, intended as a budget gaming machine. It was AUD$350 or so. I suspect this choice allowed me to bypass a lot of issues around compatibility with the drive and the FC card, although it did create other challenges, see below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second challenge: Installing in the case.&lt;/strong&gt; First I had to remove the rack sleeve surrounding the tape drive. This was screwed on, but also had cable connectors, at least one of which was really tough, so I wound up having to slide it out as far as the cables would let it, and then bend the back panel open to get it free of the cables from behind. There&amp;#39;s also an ethernet connection on my rack sleeve that I think is used in server settings to communicate directly with the drive to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, I had to install the drive in the Z420 case. You can only use the top two 5.25&amp;quot; bay slots, because any lower has the back hitting the memory. The Z420 has a system of tracks and large screws that slot in to the tracks. They actually give you spare screws, screwed into the side of the rack, but unless you know what they are, they look like part of the rack and it seems like there is no way to secure anything. (The Z420 has one side of the case riveted in place so you can only use their system to secure things each side - or, of course, get a new case). It was one of those things that was easy once you knew the trick, but took a ridiculous amount of angst to solve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third challenge: Cable connection between tape drive and FC card.&lt;/strong&gt; Let me save you some angst here and explain that the cable needed is an LC-LC multimode/duplex fibre patch cable. LC is the connector type, multimode and duplex means the signals can travel in both directions, patch means (in this context) that both ends are male. Single mode tends to be a yellow cable and multimode is blue/aqua (but I wouldn&amp;#39;t choose on colour alone). Because FC interfaces aren&amp;#39;t aimed at consumers, it&amp;#39;s not particularly simple to find any of this out. Also, the FC upgrade kit used to add fibre to HP drives installed two FC connectors, but only one of them worked - not sure if this is normal/firmware controlled/something or one was just broken. Regardless, when I was troubleshooting, changing ports got me further in. Also, the FC card only has a port on the outside, so I had to send the FC cable out by removing one of the PCI card cover plates and plug it in there. Fortunately my FC cable is a metre long so it was long enough to do this. Also, these cables have standards OM1, OM2, OM3, etc - completely irrelevant for this purpose. The standard relates to how far apart the devices can be, and they&amp;#39;re all much longer than will happen in a single case, even a rackmount case. The cables come with little white protective covers on each end &amp;quot;pin.&amp;quot; If you plug it in with the covers still on, it will go in partway but not lock in. That&amp;#39;s your clue that you need to take them off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth challenge: Getting my system to use the FC card.&lt;/strong&gt; This part was easy. The Device Manager saw the FC card immediately and showed it with a warning icon (you may need to use Show Hidden Devices to see it). I had to manually find and install drivers for it to accept it fully. Piece of cake. The main thing to know about FC cards is that underneath the hardware, they use ethernet protocols to communicate. So don&amp;#39;t worry like I did when you see references to networking and ethernet - Windows has not misidentified the card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifth challenge: Getting my system to see the drive.&lt;/strong&gt; Getting my system to see the drive was pretty easy. Once I&amp;#39;d installed drivers for the FC card, the tape drive showed up in Device Manager straight away with a question mark, which means you need to do more stuff to make it fully ready for use. The &amp;quot;do more stuff&amp;quot; means manually tracking down and installing drivers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote on what happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; I had made a mistake a few steps back - I had a unidrectional rather than duplex FC cable in place. This created a horrendous half-working situation that kept me trying things for weeks. Various pieces of software could read data from the drive fine (eg, extracting information about the drive), but all software would crash when I tried to send info the other way (eg tape quality tests, which write data, or create a drive mapping). At this point the tape drive would turn into a hidden device in Device Manager, that is, Device Manager saw it as disconnected - not sure if the tape drive was reacting to the failed attempt and disconnecting, or Windows was doing it as some sort of fault detection/attempt at error correction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My research in trying to solve this sent me ALL around the virtual world. I tried drivers and utilities and software from anyone who ever co-branded these drives (including Quantum, IBM, and Dell), I got a lead in archived forum discussions that Windows 10 support was initially buggy, so I installed dual-boot Windows 8.1 only to have the same problem, so then I installed Linux as well. (My machine is now triple boot). At some point a second FC cable I&amp;#39;d ordered arrived (I&amp;#39;d gotten impatient so I&amp;#39;d ordered one with faster shipping) and I noticed the difference in labelling and colour. I thought about it and realised that the communication was always from PC drive to the drive when it crashed, so I tried the new cable and the drive worked just fine in Windows 10. Then I did some more reading on FC cables and reverse-engineered an understanding of what was happening here. (I will have to decide at some point whether I have any need for the other two OS, but that&amp;#39;s a decision for another day).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sixth challenge: Getting the tape drive to be useful.&lt;/strong&gt; For my use case, what I really wanted was LTFS, which is something that started with LTO5 which lets you mount a tape as a &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; and lets you interact with it like you would any other drive. The required component for this is LTFS. Now, HP&amp;#39;s tape tools utilities includes LTFS, but it doesn&amp;#39;t really say so, you only find this out by digging in to the underlying files. Because I was scrambling to figure out my problem with communicating the drive, I was looking for this separately. I could find other brands&amp;#39; LTFS, but it didn&amp;#39;t solve my problem, so I thought there was a missing piece. There wasn&amp;#39;t, but it took me a long time to figure that out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that is really useful, though, is an LTFS configuring utility. I&amp;#39;ve lost track of whose one I&amp;#39;m using at this point, but IBM and Quantum both have standalone utilities for this, and what it does it create a drive mapping. If your backups routines revolve around command line scripts as mine do, that&amp;#39;s probably all you need to make your drive useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early tape drive usage was very reliant on cataloguing. Your backup would include external cataloguing so you could find content again, there was no ability to show an index from the tape itself. The change made in LTO5 that made using it as a regular drive possible was a system to catalogue the file list on the tape. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily fast, but it is there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point we&amp;#39;re getting beyond my use case, but just to fill in a bit further, if you do need a backup solution with cataloguing capabilities, most are paid, and priced for commercial use. But there is one free option, Bacula Community Edition. This thing is a bastard to figure out on your own, but there are a few videos on YouTube that make it much easier to understand what the hell it&amp;#39;s doing and how to use it. That would be my suggested first stop if you&amp;#39;re looking to add a solution on top for older pre-LTO5 systems (or later if your system is big enough to warrant cataloguing).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s what I know at the end of my little adventure. I hope it&amp;#39;s useful for other people on adventures of their own. Happy hoarding!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d14a812c-b94e-11eb-b72a-0ee8a79b8cab", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "11y45bk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nurseynurseygander", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/11y45bk/update_on_tifu_and_bought_the_wrong_tape_drive/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/11y45bk/update_on_tifu_and_bought_the_wrong_tape_drive/", "subreddit_subscribers": 674697, "created_utc": 1679452786.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "From what I see online, instagram/FB are notoriously hard to download from.

The servers are pretty much overkill for my use:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal/Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Linux machine with Docker Virtualization\n- Some Specialities (e.g. frigate NVR with Google Coral, TVHeadend, etc.)\n- Home Usage (max 1-3 users) transcoding from plex\n- Storage mergerfs with snapraid (~40TB)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I have some ideas which direction I could go with this given hardware and asking for your recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep Server2 and chassis, sell Server1, try to quite given PSU with Notua fans&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep Server2 change chassis to 4U, replace PSU with quite one, dedicated CPU cooler&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Sell the whole thing and start from scratch with adeqaute hardware&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your recommendation and sorry for my over ambitious little naive move here *urgh*&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d14a812c-b94e-11eb-b72a-0ee8a79b8cab", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "11ywdih", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "_rkey", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/11ywdih/newbie_question_on_used_supermicro_x9drthf_intel/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/11ywdih/newbie_question_on_used_supermicro_x9drthf_intel/", "subreddit_subscribers": 674697, "created_utc": 1679518595.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "My current setup is an 8 disk Synology box running 6x3tb in SHR2.\nI'm down to 1tb of free space.
