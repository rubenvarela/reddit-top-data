I copy any new or changed files from all of my devices, SD cards, USB sticks, anything that stores data, all onto an 8TB Seagate HDD. The top level has a folder called \"Backups\", and then inside there are folders for each quarter (\"2020 Q1\", \"2020 Q2\", etc.). After I finish copying all those files, I use robocopy (Windows command line) to duplicate that quarter's folder into an identical directory on a second 8TB Seagate HDD (I always buy new drives in pairs so that I can do this). I use robocopy in order to bypass the file path character limit imposed by doing it in Explorer and therefore allow for the copy to be thorough.\n\nThat said, the data on both drives should be identical as this is the only process I've ever used to put files on these drives. I don't use them casually to add/remove a file here and there, I literally only pull them out and plug them in once/quarter for this backup process.\n\n**The problem:** Last weekend I plugged them both in to ensure that I had copied a certain file into \"2022 Q4\" in my most recent external backups before I deleted it from my local system (double checking as it is an important file). It was then I noticed that the free space on [one drive shows 0.98 TB and the other shows 1.03TB](https://imgur.com/a/NaUw4aK). I know that there can be slight differences even in identical sets of data just due to how it's allocated on the drives but a difference of \\~50GB is far outside the range of what I would have considered normal for that allocation disparity. So then I went down the rabbit hole for the past week and here are all the things I've done to troubleshoot:\n\n1. I ran CHKDSK on both drives. No major issues on either drive, the operation ran smoothly. One drive (the one reporting less free space) reported that it added \"1 bad cluster to the Bad Clusters File\" in stage 5, and then corrected errors. But even if one cluster were completely gone, I'm sure it wouldn't account for \\~50GB of free space lost.\n2. Ran a defragmentation on both drives. They both reported \"0%\" fragmented and good disk health even before I started but I did it anyways just to see.\n3. In the view options, showed both hidden files and operating system files to ensure that both the Recycle Bin and System Volume Information were not the culprit - they were not. I know that due to system permissions, even when the System Volume Information folder is visible it can still show 0KB when it actually has data in it, but I also read that TreeSize will accurately show the size of these folders even if it can't show what's inside, and when I checked, TreeSize was showing them as 28KB or something very insignificant.\n4. I thought this might be a Windows 10 bug or something so I plugged both drives into an old laptop I have running Windows 7 and the [exact same free space discrepancy](https://imgur.com/a/GsDjVyR) was reported.\n5. I plugged them both into a Mac and the amount of *difference* [remained the same](https://imgur.com/a/WEi4YFc) (\\~60GB) although the total free space differed (1.08TB free vs 1.14TB). I was not concerned about the latter as the amount of difference between each drive on Windows and Mac was the same so I assume this was just a permissions thing since I was accessing it on MacOS.\n6. Checked that both HDDs had the same sized allocation units\n7. Checked that there were no restore points or shadow copies stored\n\nDuring the CHKSK I also noticed there was a pretty significant difference in file count on each drive, which again, should be impossible considering the aforementioned process I used to copy. The drive reporting the 0.98TB free was showing 3,157,105 files and the one showing the 1.03TB free space was showing 3,146,461 files - a difference of almost 11K files! [Image](https://imgur.com/a/fb3yIb5)\n\nIn Explorer, if I went into each drive's root directory and highlighted everything inside and selected \"Properties\" in order to get a total of data used, [both drives match](https://imgur.com/a/kBUkFyl). It's just on the top level that they don't. The same was the case when I tried comparing to [Windows 7](https://imgur.com/a/z4peuDA).\n\nUsing TreeSize, I thought I could get to the bottom of it. I ran two instances, one for each drive, and had them side by side as I scrolled through. However, at both the highest levels and the lowest levels, all the directories were matching exactly. And in fact, TreeSize calculated the amount of *used* space as nearly identical. There was a slight discrepancy but that one was certainly within the reasonable range that could be accounted for by allocation (size on disk). Yet TreeSize also recognised the [difference in free space](https://imgur.com/a/W10PqUp), although it's possible it just blindly gets this number from Windows.\n\nSo, I had effectively ruled out the discrepancy being in the root level (Recycle Bin, System Volume Information) as well as in the backups, which were (as far as I know) the only places data could be on the drive at all. Yet command line functions (CHKDSK, DIR) were still reporting the discrepancy in file count as well. \n\nThat gave me the idea to use DIR to simply print a list of all files in every subdirectories on the drive, for both drives. I excluded the directories themselves and just had a raw file list for both drives. Then I used Beyond Compare (diffchecker) to see where the differences were. It reported extremely few, only a few hundred (incidentally the same discrepancy as TreeSize for file count) and I was able to account for why those few hundred were showing up as different. But it's certainly well under the nearly \\~11K reported by Windows.\n\nSo at this point I'm at a total loss. Windows seems to think almost 11K files accounting for \\~50GB of space exist on one drive and not on the other, and Mac seems to recognise this also, but I can't find actual evidence of these files' existence using any method.
