When I got my masters in Civil-Transportation I took some stats modeling classes that covered regression (linear, logistic, poisson, negative binomial, etc) pretty heavily using R+NLOGIT.\n\nAt this point my stats knowledge is pretty disjointed and feel like I dont have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. From what I can tell with some research the most popular recommendations I've seen are:\n\n1. Statistical Inference- at first glance this book feels way above my level, like I can probably work out some things with effort, but I'll probably need another book to fill in the gaps.\n2. All of Statistics- Looks solid as a reference for someone who's taken way more stats than I have, super concise but super dry read.\n3. Mathematical Statistics with Applications(Wackerly)- This is one that feels like could be a possibility\n4.

Sorry for the long post, but I want to make my situation clear.\n\nTl;dr: Almost graduate receives lowball offer from Big 4 company prior to internship, already has opportunity with other company.\n\nI\u2019m currently finishing off my masters degree &amp; got an internship in a data science team at a Big 4 consulting company. Even before the intership started, the recruiter reached out to me with a job offer \u2018in case the internship goes well\u2019. I honestly didn\u2019t expect them to make an offer before they even know who I am, but now I feel pressure to take this offer as it might affect my experience during the intership as well as my final score. \n\nThere are a few reasons I would rather abstain from the offer for now. 1) The offer is contingent on the internship. If they feel like I\u2019m not a good fit for the team, they can revoke their offer at any time before starting the position. 2) The offer I got was a \u2018standard offer\u2019 that is given to anyone who just graduated, with salary &amp; compensation on the higher end of mediocre. 3) The normal way of working requires you to be in a junior position for 2 years, before you gain some professional autonomy. 4) I was only given a week to decide whether I will accept the offer or not. To summarize, the offer does not fit my expectations &amp; I feel pressured.\n\nTo give some context as to why my expectations are (a little) elevated for a recent graduate. \nOn the one hand, I already have quite attractive prospects with another company.\nDuring my 2 previous internships (one mandatory &amp; one summer internship)  I worked in a Center of Excellence at a Fortune 500 company where I mostly worked on data analytics and some automation projects. Higher management at this company was rather impressed with my performance and identified me as a \u2018high potential\u2019 they want to keep. Thanks to my positive experiences with them, I also chose to work with the company for some of my uni projects as well, including my thesis. All this has gained me quite some prominence and connections within the department. Even though they have not made a concrete offer (as they know I was still doing my masters), I\u2019ve already had some meetings with managers from different teams and HR to explore possible options. \nOn the other hand, I will also have the opportunity to start a PhD thesis once I finished my masters. Although I\u2019m not interested in lecturing, the opportunity to conduct my own research really speaks to me. Additionally this would (hopefully) offer me more/better professional opportunities in the long run.\n\nNow, to get to the dilemma. Big 4 has given me (what I feel is) a lowball offer, but I think the position there will offer me a lot more experience, as I will work in lots of different environments in a short amount of time. They also offer a great number of opportunities for further professional development (courses, trainings, \u2026). F500 however has a higher base compensation (with less extralegal advantages), and seems willing to offer a greater salary to keep me on board. HR has made clear that they cannot compete with Big4\u2019s employee development programs, but that they tend focus on individual development of key assets within the company, which would mean I will have access to educational resources as well. F500 is in medtech, has about 1/3rd of the revenue and about 1/5th of the employees of Big 4. \n\nMy question to you guys: How would you decide what to do? What are key factors that impact your decision at this point? Would it be possible for me to leverage the offer from F500 into a higher salary at Big4? Am I better off doing a PhD now and waiting for better opportunities?\n\nAlso: Is it normal for a recruiter to only give you a week to decide on an offer? They reached out to me, barely gave me any notice on the meeting and then sprung the one-week deadline on me in the last 5 seconds of the meeting. I feel this is a little unprofessional as it completely eliminates any chances of comparing offers.\n\nThanks for the advice.", "author_fullname": "t2_htj6ydlz", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Looking for advice on starting my career in DS/DA.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_11hvcqs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1677922978.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, looking for some advice and opinions on what my next move should be.
