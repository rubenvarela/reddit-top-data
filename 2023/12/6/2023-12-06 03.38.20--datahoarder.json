I know I can build my own NAS but I really like how simple these things are and I don't want to constantly worry about configuration tasks, etc. NAS usually have all the UI/Storage/RAID items figured out and make that less of an effort.\n\nMy main virtualization machine will have a 10GbE connection to my UDM-SE and I'd like to find a NAS that can match that speed, yes I know it may be overkill but I have it and I'd like to use it and get more familiar with DAC cables/SFPs/etc (It's a home lab and I want to have fun trying new things).\n\nRequirements for NAS?\n\n* Cheapish? &lt;\\~$300ish? (I don't mind searching Ebay/Marketplace/Reddit for used)\n* 4-Bay (3.5HDDs I bought some used HGST drives)\n* SSD Caching (NVMe preferred)\n* 16GB of RAM or Upgradable to more\n* 10GbE Expansion if not native (add-in card, teaming etc)\n* USB/Thunderbolt connectivity? I plan on backing up this machine to a single external.\n* Plex? If it can, great. If not I can host on my virtualization box and point to a share where the media is located.\n\nThanks for all the future help!

I've done some research, but nothing very detailed at this point and I'm a total noob at home server stuff but familiar with building computers, so please keep that in mind.\n\nPlease read all the way through before asking questions or making suggestions.\n\nMy parents have been asking (nagging) me to set up some kind of \"local family storage\", I originally considered getting a DAS (probably the Terramaster D6-320) and putting 6 20 TB HDDs in it.  That limits the storage to just my computer though unless I network share the drives (via Windows (nightmares ensue)).\n\nGiven the expected amount of storage needed and considering future needs, a commercial NAS is going to be way to expensive.  My total budget is $2,500 to $4,000 USD, so I'm trying to save money by making a DIY NAS with what we have on hand plus the parts needed to make it work.  Excluding the 20 TB drives, I'd like to keep the cost under $300 USD.\n\nAfter looking around the house I found five unused computers, three of them I ruled out due to lack of space for HDDs (plus other considerations)\n\n* Gateway 820GM Media Center Desktop (Intel Pentium 4), dumped on me by a family member\n* Dell Dimension 2400 (Intel Pentium 4 or Celeron, I don't remember), dumped on me by a friend\n* Custom built AMD Athlon 64 3200+ in a Cooler Master Praetorian case (built in 2003), used to be the family computer\n\nThe last two I found (details below) could possibly be used as a NAS, but I'm not sure how capable they are for the task.\n\nI would prefer to run the NAS headless after setup if possible and our LAN speed is Gigabit.\n\nI'm leaning toward Openmediavault (using BTRFS) for the OS as these are the primary uses for the NAS at this time\n\n* Mass family file storage - Currently looking at about 50 TB between two computers, two laptops, 5 external USB drives, 4 phones, 3 tablets and between 300-500 CD/DVD/BR discs (plus whatever other family members decide to send us).\n* Cloud storage for phones and tablets - I've seen NextCloud mentioned, any others I should look into?\n* My game libraries (Steam, GOG, Epic, etc.) including old floppy/CD/DVD backups and retro games\n* Backup of the local family computers (OS drives only)\n* A password manager - I know of Bitwarden, are there any others that can be self hosted?\n* A music player - Any suggestions for software?\n\nAnd finally, this is a list of the disks I'm looking at putting in the NAS\n\n* 1    ? GB SSD for boot drive (see question below)\n* 6-8  20 TB HDD for storage (to be bought)\n* 2    1 TB HDD for storage (in current computer)\n* 2  300 GB HDD for storage (in system #1)\n* 1  320 GB HDD for storage (in current computer)\n* 1  500 GB HDD for storage (in system #1)\n\nAnything important would be backed up to removable drives and all devices would be connected to the same router (hardwired (Cat 5E) for the two computers and NAS, wireless for everything else).\n\nI think that covers the current requirements, here are the two systems under consideration:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSystem #1, currently assembled (unused) (built in 2006)\n\n* CPU: AMD Athlon 64 x2 4600+ (stock heatsink)\n* Motherboard: ASUS M2N-E\n* Memory: 8 GB DDR2-800 (max for MB, Corsair or Kingston, don't remember)\n* Case: Cooler Master CM Stacker (12 5.25\" external drive bays, 11 useable due to moveable front panel I/O block)\n* GPU: HIS Radeon X1900 XT\n* Powersupply: OCZ 800 watt\n* HDDs: 2 300 GB Maxtor (SATA2/3G), 1 300 GB Maxtor (PATA/133), 1 500 GB Seagate (SATA2/3G)\n* ODD: Plextor PX-760A (PATA/133)\n\nThis was my computer until I built the one listed below and gave this to my parents.  I don't know of any issues with this system, it got used up until last year when I built a new computer for my parents and has been kept plugged in just in case it was needed for something.\n\nAfter getting the server set up, I'd remove the GPU and use the x16 slot for the needed HDD expansion/HBA card.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSystem #2, disassembled (built in 2013)\n\n* CPU: Intel i7-3770k\n* Motherboard: ASRock Z77 Extreme4 (dead?)\n* Heatsink: Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo\n* Memory: 16 GB Corsair Vengeance LP DDR3-1600\n* GPU: Gigabyte Radeon HD7970 OC\n* Powersupply: PC Power &amp; Cooling Silencer MKII 750 watt\n\nThere is a possibility that some of these components don't work due to a malfunction or short that happened over a year ago.\n\nThis was my second computer and saw multi-hour daily use.  One day I went to get supper (computer was still on), during which there was a power blip (power dropped and instantly recovered), and when I returned the computer was off.\n\nI tried multiple things including removing everything but the CPU and heatsink and using a different power supply, but couldn't get the motherboard to power on.  The Dr.Debug never lit up even when a different power supply was used.\n\nEither the motherboard or the CPU (doubtful) shorted and I have no way of checking.  I do know the power supply turns on, but I'm not sure if there's any damage to it, the GPU or RAM.\n\nThe HDDs that were in this system are currently in other family computers as secondary storage, nobody has reported any issues with them so far.\n\nIf I use this one, the case from above would be reused after I disassembled that system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a list of the stuff I know would be needed regardless of which system was used\n\n* 4/8/12 port SATA expansion card(s) (or SAS internal 2/4/8 port controller card)\n* SATA or SATA to SAS cables (depending on card)\n* 6-8 20 TB hard drives (WD Red Pro or Seagate Iron Wolf Pro)\n* 1 4-in-3 drive cage (Cooler Master if possible), currently have 2 in the case, one is already fully populated, might look at a couple of 5-in-3, but that would raise the cost\n* 2 Molex to 4 SATA adapter or SATA extension\n* 1 SSD for boot drive\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I do system #2 then I'd also need\n\n* Z77 Motherboard\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions about the system hardware under consideration:\n\n1. Is system #1 viable?  I'm doubtful that it would be up to the task as it only has PCIe Gen1 and SATA2/3G capabilities.  Am I correct and it should be kept for emergency use only or is there something I'm overlooking?\n2. Is system #2 worth taking a chance on with a used motherboard and hope for the best?\n3. Would a different NAS OS suit my use case and hardware better?  Please note that Unraid is out because I'd have to pay for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions about the extra hardware:\n\n1. Most of the 8+ port SATA expansion cards on Amazon seem to be of the PCIe x1 variety.  Is this okay or should I be looking for PCIe x4 or x8?\n2. Would it be better to just get a SAS HBA card?  Going by this ([https://servers.hydrology.cc/2023/01/21/i-ran-out-of-sata-ports/](https://servers.hydrology.cc/2023/01/21/i-ran-out-of-sata-ports/)) should I only consider a 16i HBA given how many storage drives I'm planning to use?\n3. Any recommendations for a 4/5-in-3 drive cage with a SATA backplane that doesn't cost a lot (less than $40 USD)?  All the ones I'm finding are $70+.\n4. What is the smallest SSD that I should get for the boot drive?  Could I use a 16 or 8 GB?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now for some questions about HDD setup, this is how I'm thinking of doing it:\n\n    Pool 1 - family mass storage\n        3 20 TB (2 data, 1 parity)\n    Pool 2 - cloud storage and music\n        3 20 TB (2 data, 1 parity)\n    Pool 3 - games library, current\n        1 20 TB\n    Pool 4 - games library, retro\n        1 20 TB\n    Pool 5 - system backups\n        2 300 GB (data)\n        1 320 GB (data)\n        1 500 GB (data)\n        1 1 TB (data)\n        1 1 TB (parity)\n\nGiven the above layout, and considering I'm planning to use BTRFS, could I do away with the parity drives?

That limits the storage to just my computer though unless I network share the drives (via Windows (nightmares ensue)).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the expected amount of storage needed and considering future needs, a commercial NAS is going to be way to expensive.  My total budget is $2,500 to $4,000 USD, so I&amp;#39;m trying to save money by making a DIY NAS with what we have on hand plus the parts needed to make it work.  Excluding the 20 TB drives, I&amp;#39;d like to keep the cost under $300 USD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After looking around the house I found five unused computers, three of them I ruled out due to lack of space for HDDs (plus other considerations)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gateway 820GM Media Center Desktop (Intel Pentium 4), dumped on me by a family member&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dell Dimension 2400 (Intel Pentium 4 or Celeron, I don&amp;#39;t remember), dumped on me by a friend&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Custom built AMD Athlon 64 3200+ in a Cooler Master Praetorian case (built in 2003), used to be the family computer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last two I found (details below) could possibly be used as a NAS, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how capable they are for the task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to run the NAS headless after setup if possible and our LAN speed is Gigabit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m leaning toward Openmediavault (using BTRFS) for the OS as these are the primary uses for the NAS at this time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mass family file storage - Currently looking at about 50 TB between two computers, two laptops, 5 external USB drives, 4 phones, 3 tablets and between 300-500 CD/DVD/BR discs (plus whatever other family members decide to send us).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cloud storage for phones and tablets - I&amp;#39;ve seen NextCloud mentioned, any others I should look into?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My game libraries (Steam, GOG, Epic, etc.) including old floppy/CD/DVD backups and retro games&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Backup of the local family computers (OS drives only)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A password manager - I know of Bitwarden, are there any others that can be self hosted?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A music player - Any suggestions for software?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, this is a list of the disks I&amp;#39;m looking at putting in the NAS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1    ? GB SSD for boot drive (see question below)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6-8  20 TB HDD for storage (to be bought)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2    1 TB HDD for storage (in current computer)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2  300 GB HDD for storage (in system #1)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1  320 GB HDD for storage (in current computer)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1  500 GB HDD for storage (in system #1)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything important would be backed up to removable drives and all devices would be connected to the same router (hardwired (Cat 5E) for the two computers and NAS, wireless for everything else).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that covers the current requirements, here are the two systems under consideration:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;System #1, currently assembled (unused) (built in 2006)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CPU: AMD Athlon 64 x2 4600+ (stock heatsink)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motherboard: ASUS M2N-E&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Memory: 8 GB DDR2-800 (max for MB, Corsair or Kingston, don&amp;#39;t remember)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Case: Cooler Master CM Stacker (12 5.25&amp;quot; external drive bays, 11 useable due to moveable front panel I/O block)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPU: HIS Radeon X1900 XT&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Powersupply: OCZ 800 watt&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HDDs: 2 300 GB Maxtor (SATA2/3G), 1 300 GB Maxtor (PATA/133), 1 500 GB Seagate (SATA2/3G)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ODD: Plextor PX-760A (PATA/133)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my computer until I built the one listed below and gave this to my parents.  I don&amp;#39;t know of any issues with this system, it got used up until last year when I built a new computer for my parents and has been kept plugged in just in case it was needed for something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After getting the server set up, I&amp;#39;d remove the GPU and use the x16 slot for the needed HDD expansion/HBA card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;System #2, disassembled (built in 2013)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CPU: Intel i7-3770k&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motherboard: ASRock Z77 Extreme4 (dead?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Heatsink: Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Memory: 16 GB Corsair Vengeance LP DDR3-1600&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPU: Gigabyte Radeon HD7970 OC&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Powersupply: PC Power &amp;amp; Cooling Silencer MKII 750 watt&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a possibility that some of these components don&amp;#39;t work due to a malfunction or short that happened over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my second computer and saw multi-hour daily use.  One day I went to get supper (computer was still on), during which there was a power blip (power dropped and instantly recovered), and when I returned the computer was off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried multiple things including removing everything but the CPU and heatsink and using a different power supply, but couldn&amp;#39;t get the motherboard to power on.  The Dr.Debug never lit up even when a different power supply was used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either the motherboard or the CPU (doubtful) shorted and I have no way of checking.  I do know the power supply turns on, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if there&amp;#39;s any damage to it, the GPU or RAM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The HDDs that were in this system are currently in other family computers as secondary storage, nobody has reported any issues with them so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I use this one, the case from above would be reused after I disassembled that system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a list of the stuff I know would be needed regardless of which system was used&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4/8/12 port SATA expansion card(s) (or SAS internal 2/4/8 port controller card)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SATA or SATA to SAS cables (depending on card)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6-8 20 TB hard drives (WD Red Pro or Seagate Iron Wolf Pro)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1 4-in-3 drive cage (Cooler Master if possible), currently have 2 in the case, one is already fully populated, might look at a couple of 5-in-3, but that would raise the cost&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 Molex to 4 SATA adapter or SATA extension&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1 SSD for boot drive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I do system #2 then I&amp;#39;d also need&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Z77 Motherboard&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Questions about the system hardware under consideration:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is system #1 viable?  I&amp;#39;m doubtful that it would be up to the task as it only has PCIe Gen1 and SATA2/3G capabilities.  Am I correct and it should be kept for emergency use only or is there something I&amp;#39;m overlooking?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is system #2 worth taking a chance on with a used motherboard and hope for the best?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Would a different NAS OS suit my use case and hardware better?  Please note that Unraid is out because I&amp;#39;d have to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Questions about the extra hardware:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Most of the 8+ port SATA expansion cards on Amazon seem to be of the PCIe x1 variety.  Is this okay or should I be looking for PCIe x4 or x8?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Would it be better to just get a SAS HBA card?  Going by this (&lt;a href=\"https://servers.hydrology.cc/2023/01/21/i-ran-out-of-sata-ports/\"&gt;https://servers.hydrology.cc/2023/01/21/i-ran-out-of-sata-ports/&lt;/a&gt;) should I only consider a 16i HBA given how many storage drives I&amp;#39;m planning to use?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Any recommendations for a 4/5-in-3 drive cage with a SATA backplane that doesn&amp;#39;t cost a lot (less than $40 USD)?  All the ones I&amp;#39;m finding are $70+.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What is the smallest SSD that I should get for the boot drive?  Could I use a 16 or 8 GB?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now for some questions about HDD setup, this is how I&amp;#39;m thinking of doing it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pool 1 - family mass storage\n    3 20 TB (2 data, 1 parity)\nPool 2 - cloud storage and music\n    3 20 TB (2 data, 1 parity)\nPool 3 - games library, current\n    1 20 TB\nPool 4 - games library, retro\n    1 20 TB\nPool 5 - system backups\n    2 300 GB (data)\n    1 320 GB (data)\n    1 500 GB (data)\n    1 1 TB (data)\n    1 1 TB (parity)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the above layout, and considering I&amp;#39;m planning to use BTRFS, could I do away with the parity drives?  This would reduce the number of 20 TB drives I&amp;#39;d need to buy and as stated earlier anything important will be backed up to removable drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be better to combine Pool 1 &amp;amp; 2?  How would this affect whatever cloud storage and music software I go with and family shares?  Is there a better layout?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not worried about my game libraries as most of the current ones have some kind of file integrity checker and my old media and retro games are already backed up in at least three other places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s stuff I forgot to mention, so please feel free to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this, and for any constructive criticism or advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18b8q6w", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RonnieOnReddit", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/18b8q6w/can_i_use_any_of_this_old_hardware_for_a_nas_plus/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18b8q6w/can_i_use_any_of_this_old_hardware_for_a_nas_plus/", "subreddit_subscribers": 716711, "created_utc": 1701770469.0, "num_crossposts": 2, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I current have the Sabrent EC-WPNE losses connection to the slightest bump.

(Or any part of the setup).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i try to do my own research all i can come up with is stupid \u201cadvertisement documents\u201d which basically tell me to right click and press share.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "1.44MB", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18bo4tt", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ares0027", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/18bo4tt/what_is_the_best_practice_to_share_multiple/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18bo4tt/what_is_the_best_practice_to_share_multiple/", "subreddit_subscribers": 716711, "created_utc": 1701814800.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "While browsing the web, I read a shit ton of material about all kinds of stuff, and naturally I cannot read them all at once, and I need to store them for the future, in an accessible form so that I actually read the stuff and not procrastinate.\n\nI have used pocket and instapaper in the past but neither of those really hit the mark for me.

Same with security etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also seems like backing up my nas somewhere online would easily cost $1k a year for 20TB of storage, so I&amp;#39;m wondering if that&amp;#39;s inline with costs to have that extra security or if there are cheaper ways to do it for that peace of mind?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would then just do some basics like backing up a few windows pcs, MacBook and iPhone automatically, so wouldn&amp;#39;t need anything super powerful for video transcoding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be in my bedroom however about 4m from where I sleep so that&amp;#39;s another consideration if I can make a quieter DIY NAS, or if I can set the drives to sleep when not in use and have it not do backups from dropbox over night (or will they still just spin up every hour anyway).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah my main consideration is something reliable and safe to backup from dropbox automatically as the data is pretty important.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18blv4b", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GergDanger", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/18blv4b/safe_solution_to_backup_from_dropbox_to_nas_diy/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18blv4b/safe_solution_to_backup_from_dropbox_to_nas_diy/", "subreddit_subscribers": 716711, "created_utc": 1701809130.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Is there a way to rip videos from [darkfans.com](https://darkfans.com) ?\n\nThey appear to have some kind of DRM protection.", "author_fullname": "t2_5n01wfq5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Ripping videos from DarkFans?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_18brxdw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1701824909.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to rip videos from &lt;a href=\"https://darkfans.com\"&gt;darkfans.com&lt;/a&gt;
