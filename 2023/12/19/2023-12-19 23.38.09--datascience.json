One company that tends to post a lot of jobs Is Home Depot. Many of these jobs are ghost jobs that they have no intention of filling, or they are not even real jobs because they are running on a skeleton crew in their talent acquisition team from laying off nearly everyone after record-breaking profits in order to pay for a stock split....\n\n\n\n**Why you should avoid this company**\n\n\n- Layoffs for no reason other than to boost their profit\n\n- Fake recognition. You get Homer awards, Merrit bonuses, and all that, but it's all fake. They only do this to keep you from quitting before they can lay you off. I got several merit rewards for working over 50 hours a week, still got laid off. So what was all that recognition about me being a top achiever for? Just BS\n\n\n- Unrealistic goals. The goals that this company are absurd, like, literally insane. They consolidate departments and teams, but expect you to do the work of people that have been displaced, or do multiple jobs at the same time. They are not even remotely interested in what is realistically required to achieve a project. They want you to complete it in record-breaking time, and if there is something wrong with their data, or it will take additional time, that's not acceptable. Get it done under any conditions. There were multiple times we were told that it is not acceptable to push back on project deadlines or delay delivery of a report under any circumstances, even if we had people out on PTO, or there was some problem with the data source where data engineering was working on it, or it wasn't refreshing. Absolutely unrealistic\n\n\n- They do not care about you, or your family, but they say they are a family company. When people have a death in the family, or they need to take time off for surgery, they are always working. Even if they are officially on PTO, you see them online, or you're routed to these people, and you know they are going through something really tough, and you have to ask yourself, why are so many people always working during PTO, or when they are supposed to be taking leave for family or grievance?\n\n\n- lots of mandatory corporate fun. Was required to go play volleyball, and kickball on two separate occasions that was organized by our leaders. They showed up late, and then, completely disappeared and decided they weren't playing anymore. But people who are in their '50s or older are out there playing, barely able to even run. It is a very awkward and really strange dynamic when you are required to participate in corporate fund organized by leadership, but they just disappear and don't want to do it. It means they think you're a peasant\n\n\n- The pay sucks. It's really bad. A standard data analyst role pays around 70K, and that's in Atlanta. Like, you are required to be in the city of Atlanta Where cost of living is extreme. There are no pay raises annually, they give you the awful merit increase and that's it. It's hardly even an increase, I was told I was lucky to get 3% because they're not really giving raises this year to anyone, so I should feel lucky., yeah, they really told me that a 3% increase is me being lucky. Absolutely outrageous and unhinged\n\n\n- There's no job security at all. You're always at risk of being laid off, especially if you get paid well. When they do layoffs, it's always the employees who are paid well who are hit first because they have the highest salaries. Last round of layoffs they did, lots of senior analysts were cut, senior data scientists, etc. They always keep the junior people who don't get paid much though\n\n\n- HR is absolutely unhinged, and vindictive. A lot of the people that were laid off, they seem to be unable to secure another job afterwards in the future. I know of at least two dozen people off the top of my head that were laid off from the company and repeatedly tried to get back into various positions, but treated like worthless outsiders despite having a career with the company for many years. I repeatedly tried to apply to different positions, but was told that the competition is so fierce and I never seem to get that next position to get back into the company. Which means that they are completely and totally lying about trying to rehire the displaced employees. They will lay you off, and then, treat you like you have never worked for the company before in your life and expect you to prove your worth\n\n\n\n\n**Some good aspects of working here**\n\nI don't want it to seem like I am totally biased against them, so I wanted to include at least some good aspects of working for the company....\n\n\n- The people are great. You work with a lot of hardworking, honest, really cool people who are interesting\n\n\n- Great office and location if you really like going into the office and participating in corporate activities, you'll be well at home here. Has a college culture if you like that kind of thing\n\n\n- very big diverse company with lots of different teams and environments. You never get bored because you're always working with new teams and doing something different and dynamic\n\n\n- data stack is fairly modern, but not too crazy or complex. They stopped using Microsoft Access finally, and started moving towards BigQuery\n\n\n- company culture is nice. Everyone wears orange aprons on earnings day. You can also tour and go to different Home Depot places like design center, innovation center, tour a Home Depot store with a group of people\n\n\n\n\n\n**Key takeaway**\n\n\nHonestly, this company is very dramatic and not a great place to work.

So what I've been doing so far is going through a lot of Biostatistics documents and trying to replicate some of the examples in medicine into marketing which held promising result in terms of how we can infer some of our marketing practices (e.g. what's the likelihood of a customer purchasing again at time interval t after being exposed to a specific promotion).
