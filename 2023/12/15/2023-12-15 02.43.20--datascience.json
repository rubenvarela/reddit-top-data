I've been applying and interviewing for about 9 months. Just landed my 2nd offer (1st one was really low) and I could use some unbiased input. A bit of a background.\n\nI have a career in manufacturing and currently working as such. I got an MSDS paid for by my employer. I do some DA and DS (SQL, Python, PowerBI) type work at my current positions which gives me things to talk about at interviews. Now onto the offer:\n\nIt's a Data Scientist position, on site at a large international company with a local HQ in a MCOL city. They gave me the base salary I asked for ($120k) but when I saw the rest of the comp package, I was underwhelmed:\n\n1) They don't offer any bonuses. So whatever increase in salary I'd get, I'm losing about the same amount in bonuses from the current job so it's a wash. If this was it, I can live with that to get my foot in the door.\n\n2) I'd be paying $5400/yr more than current employer for health care of a similar plan. \n\n3) Their 401k match is about half of what my current employer offers and vested after 3 yrs. I'm not likely to stay that long so basically no match. I'd be losing about $7k/yr + compound growth vs current job\n\n4) If I leave now, I owe my employer \\~$25k in tuition reimbursement (tapers down over the next 16 months). I negotiated a $10k (taxable so \\~$6600) singing bonus to offset that but that's still \\~$18.4k of my savings I'll have to lose to make the transition\n\nI've explained this (w/out all the numbers) to the company, they responded with the singing bonus. I can ask for a $10k salary increase but they had to jump through hoops to get the current offer approved so I doubt it'll happen.\n\nFinancially, it doesn't make sense. I know. But my impression is that once I'm in a DS job, it'll be relatively easy to find a more senior, higher paying position.  Seems like people here are jumping ship (and salaries) every couple years. I'm also sick of applying/interviewing, it's been 9 months.  \n\nProbably worth noting that although I don't love my current job, and sometimes dread it, I'm not totally miserable. I'm also expecting an annual raise next month (4% &amp; 5% last 2 yrs) which further increases the salary gap and there's a chance I can make a lateral move to keep things interesting.\n\nSo here are my thoughts. Any input is appreciated:\n\nOption 1: Take the job and start looking for something better in 6 months\n\nOption 2: Wait it out, keep looking for something better and keep my savings (Honestly, the more I type, the more I'm leaning toward this option)", "author_fullname": "t2_fhq8w", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Conflicted on DS offer", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "fun", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_18i0gku", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1702528358.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post, sorry!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you all know the job market has been rough. I&amp;#39;ve been applying and interviewing for about 9 months. Just landed my 2nd offer (1st one was really low) and I could use some unbiased input. A bit of a background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a career in manufacturing and currently working as such. I got an MSDS paid for by my employer. I do some DA and DS (SQL, Python, PowerBI) type work at my current positions which gives me things to talk about at interviews. Now onto the offer:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a Data Scientist position, on site at a large international company with a local HQ in a MCOL city. They gave me the base salary I asked for ($120k) but when I saw the rest of the comp package, I was underwhelmed:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) They don&amp;#39;t offer any bonuses. So whatever increase in salary I&amp;#39;d get, I&amp;#39;m losing about the same amount in bonuses from the current job so it&amp;#39;s a wash. If this was it, I can live with that to get my foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I&amp;#39;d be paying $5400/yr more than current employer for health care of a similar plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Their 401k match is about half of what my current employer offers and vested after 3 yrs. I&amp;#39;m not likely to stay that long so basically no match. I&amp;#39;d be losing about $7k/yr + compound growth vs current job&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) If I leave now, I owe my employer ~$25k in tuition reimbursement (tapers down over the next 16 months). I negotiated a $10k (taxable so ~$6600) singing bonus to offset that but that&amp;#39;s still ~$18.4k of my savings I&amp;#39;ll have to lose to make the transition&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve explained this (w/out all the numbers) to the company, they responded with the singing bonus. I can ask for a $10k salary increase but they had to jump through hoops to get the current offer approved so I doubt it&amp;#39;ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Financially, it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. I know. But my impression is that once I&amp;#39;m in a DS job, it&amp;#39;ll be relatively easy to find a more senior, higher paying position.  Seems like people here are jumping ship (and salaries) every couple years. I&amp;#39;m also sick of applying/interviewing, it&amp;#39;s been 9 months.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably worth noting that although I don&amp;#39;t love my current job, and sometimes dread it, I&amp;#39;m not totally miserable. I&amp;#39;m also expecting an annual raise next month (4% &amp;amp; 5% last 2 yrs) which further increases the salary gap and there&amp;#39;s a chance I can make a lateral move to keep things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here are my thoughts.
