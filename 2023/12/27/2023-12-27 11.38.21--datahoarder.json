Wall of text incoming.\n\nI've been amassing a large collection of files over the last couple of years (around 1TB total, which is probably not a lot to most of you lol), and have been looking into finally getting around to creating a setup that adheres to the 3-2-1 backup rule.\n\nI've been browsing and searching for beginner tips on this subreddit for a long time today and am just overwhelmed. Lots of terminology and abbreviations that I don't understand. I wouldn't consider myself computer illiterate, but I have never dived into the hardware side of things before.\n\nMy situation / background: I currently live a semi-nomadic lifestyle, and so want something that is portable. I was planning on purchasing 2 external HDDs (2TB or 4TB) to keep with full backups and update weekly / monthly, and keep one in a storage unit. For my 3rd backup I currently use a Sandisk Extreme SSD 1TB, for files or games that I watch / work / play directly off the drive for and that need fast speeds (I may upgrade to a 2TB or 4TB version). I also use both paid MEGA and Protondrive services, but am unable to upload and store my whole collection in, and only use it for very important files or things that I need access to everywhere.\n\nI guess I was just looking for some advice on a few things:\n\n1: Does this backup plan sound like a good plan?

Wall of text incoming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been amassing a large collection of files over the last couple of years (around 1TB total, which is probably not a lot to most of you lol), and have been looking into finally getting around to creating a setup that adheres to the 3-2-1 backup rule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been browsing and searching for beginner tips on this subreddit for a long time today and am just overwhelmed. Lots of terminology and abbreviations that I don&amp;#39;t understand. I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider myself computer illiterate, but I have never dived into the hardware side of things before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My situation / background: I currently live a semi-nomadic lifestyle, and so want something that is portable. I was planning on purchasing 2 external HDDs (2TB or 4TB) to keep with full backups and update weekly / monthly, and keep one in a storage unit. For my 3rd backup I currently use a Sandisk Extreme SSD 1TB, for files or games that I watch / work / play directly off the drive for and that need fast speeds (I may upgrade to a 2TB or 4TB version). I also use both paid MEGA and Protondrive services, but am unable to upload and store my whole collection in, and only use it for very important files or things that I need access to everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I was just looking for some advice on a few things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1: Does this backup plan sound like a good plan? Any modifications you would make?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2: Are there any recommendations for brands / basic external drives? How do you avoid drives with low failure rates, just reading online reviews?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3: Is there any essential software I should have to help manage drives / check on drive health?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any links to specific resources it would be helpful as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18rjcm4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Coolpop19", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/18rjcm4/beginner_overwhelmed/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18rjcm4/beginner_overwhelmed/", "subreddit_subscribers": 721049, "created_utc": 1703627694.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hi, I would like to upgrade my work computer to have significantly more storage space for high speed NMVE SSDs.  \nI've read that PCI-E SATA Expansion cards aren't reliable and will give me issues.  \nDo you guys have recommendations of a solution that allows me to easily add 4-6 TB (minimum) to my workstation?

It provides an alternate way to share your photos and videos **from** your smartphone **to** your preferred cloud storage (iCloud, Google Photos, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) or to your home computer via Wifi while at home. Best of all, it doesn't make file naming an afterthought (as does the iPhone). Instead, when transferring your photos and video files, the app suggests the same nomenclature that I have been using for years (and allows you to customize it). The app correctly names the files using the correct meta data info.\n\n1. Install [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/home) on smartphone  \n2. Install PhotoSyncCompanion on Windows  \n3. Set up app to connect to Windows computer on the same WiFi as smartphone  \n4. Click Recents  \n5. Click Update  \n6. Click New  \n7. Click Computer\n\nIt is fast, uses correct file name nomenclature, can transfer to Windows computer at home inside your WiFi network, or to Google Photos, OneDrive, etc. from anywhere. If your computer is connected via an ethernet cable to your network (as mine is), it's an extra step to set up at the start, but it works. You can manually transfer the photos and videos or set it to auto-transfer at a specific time or  when you arrived at a location (eg, home, work, etc.) and are in WiFi.  \n\n\n**MY PRE-2024 METHOD**  \nPrior to PhotoSync app, I used the following imperfect setup. I set the OneDrive app on my smartphone to automatically backup all the new photos and I videos I recorded. I also had Google Photos do the same. On iPhone, this is not automatic and it can take hours before the sync occurs. I found one can force Google Photos to backup the photos and videos by opening the Google Photos app. But that doesn't see to work with the OneDrive app. I'm not sure how to force OneDrive to sync the files on demand. For the OneDrive version of the files, I mapped it to Windows Explorer so I can easily access my backed up files.\n\n*The naming problem*\n\nPhotos and video files synchronized via Google Photos keep the original name created on the iPhone, for instance, IMG\\_8273.jpg. So if I download this photo from Google Photos, I will need to rename it to the date the photo was taken. By contrast, OneDrive renames the file to the date it was taken, but uses UTC-0 time. While this is accurate, it is not what I want and requires renaming on my Windows 10 computer. I prefer the interface of the Windows application Better File Rename 5 mostly because I have been using it for many years and could easily rename the JPG files to the date the photo was taken. But this application won't work for the MOV files because the iPhone stores the video created date in the meta data field *com.apple.quicktime.creationdate*. Better File Rename 5 can't see that particular meta data. Neither can Advanced Renamed 3.88. Neither can Bulk Rename Utility 3.3.2.0. It's possible that another renamer application with a GUI can do it, but I haven't tested them all. The one renamer software that will do this job properly is the one that scares many people\u2014the command line based but crazy powerful [EXIFtool](https://exiftool.org/).\n\nHere is how to rename iOS-created MOV video files to the date on your Windows 10 computer.\n\n1. Put a copy of the MOV files into a folder in, say, C:\\\\RenamingFolder  \n2. Download ExifTool and place the EXE file in that folder.  \n3. Rename the file to exiftool.exe  \n4. Open Notepad, enter the following code, and save to C:\\\\RenamingFolder with the name Rename file to IPhone video creation date.bat\n\n    exiftool \"-FileName&lt;creationdate\" -d \"%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H-%%M-%%S.%%%%e\" K:\\RenamingFolder\ncmd /k\n\n5.  Double click the bat file and EXIFtool will rename the MOV files to a filename using the correct meta info. \n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nPhotoSync will solve the file naming problem. I love this app. As for the 2023 photos and videos I have not have time to properly rename, the EXIFtool solution will solve that for me. I'll have properly named files using the accurate date and time.\n\nFinally, for the record, I should add that while the format *2024-01-16 17-45-03.jpg* helps organize the files in order, I like to batch add an ending to the files. For instance, if I have a few dozen photos of a birthday, I select them all in Windows Explorer, right click, select Better File Rename from the context menu, and then apply the *Text - Add text to end* command from the menus, and type in with a leading space *Mike's 8th birthday.* So the final file name with be *2024-01-16 17-45-03 Mike's 8th birthday.jpg.*", "author_fullname": "t2_7jhiw", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Workflow: copy iPhone photos and videos to Windows 10 with filenames using the date the photo or video was really created", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "guide", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_18ro2lq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Guide/How-to", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1703640324.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my 2024 workflow for saving photos and videos from my iPhone 14 (iOS 17.1.2) to my Windows 10 computer using the picture taken date or the video created date as the filename in the format &lt;em&gt;2024-01-16 17-45-03.jpg&lt;/em&gt; (or .mov).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USING PHOTOSYNC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI just found out about this invaluable smartphone software.

For instance, if I have a few dozen photos of a birthday, I select them all in Windows Explorer, right click, select Better File Rename from the context menu, and then apply the &lt;em&gt;Text - Add text to end&lt;/em&gt; command from the menus, and type in with a leading space &lt;em&gt;Mike&amp;#39;s 8th birthday.&lt;/em&gt; So the final file name with be &lt;em&gt;2024-01-16 17-45-03 Mike&amp;#39;s 8th birthday.jpg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "69c7c050-b94e-11eb-9c9c-0eb6f39ede5f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18ro2lq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThumperStrauss", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/18ro2lq/workflow_copy_iphone_photos_and_videos_to_windows/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18ro2lq/workflow_copy_iphone_photos_and_videos_to_windows/", "subreddit_subscribers": 721049, "created_utc": 1703640324.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Is it basically the same approach as capturing audio from vinyl, and just need to do a good job of cleaning the tape and getting a good player?

So, can I use SilverFast or VueScan with the Epson FastFoto (FF-680W) scanner?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18rcffj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThumperStrauss", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/18rcffj/epson_fastfoto_with_silverfast_or_vuescan/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18rcffj/epson_fastfoto_with_silverfast_or_vuescan/", "subreddit_subscribers": 721049, "created_utc": 1703609637.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I have a Super Micro JBOD server which is populated with 4TB SAS disks, the disks are starting to fail, so it's time for me to upgrade.   \n\n\nThe unit has 36 bays, 24 at the front are 4tb in a pool (3 parity), 2 x 4tb at the back are the boot disks in mirror.

but have no hands-on experience with NASs, RAID arrays or extremely high capacity HDDs, and thus have some questions regarding which architecture I should choose for my upcoming storage system.\n\nI'm currently storing my important files (mostly photos and videos) on 2x 3TB drives which are mirrored manually, but I'm starting to fill the drives, and have thus decided to invest in a higher capacity and more redundant solution. \n\nTaking a look at the market pricing where I live, I came up with two options:\n\n1. 3x 4TB drives in RAID with 1 parity + 1x 8TB drive as an offsite backup (no parity there, SMR disk) -&gt; 8TB effective space, \\~57 USD/eff. TB\n2. 3x 18TB drives mirroring each other, thus 2 \"parity\" disks, at least one of which would be offsite -&gt; 18TB effective space, \\~50 USD/eff. TB\n\nMy goal is to build a robust solution, that I can use for many years. While I won't need more than 8TB in the near future, I wouldn't mind spending the extra for the 18TB option as long as it can be considered just as, if not more reliable. At first, I wanted to build a RAID array with 2 parity disks, but quickly scrapped this idea as many reddit threads advise against that in favor of having an offsite backup, this is why I came up with the possible solutions I listed. All drives are CMR, apart from the 8TB barracuda in option 1.\n\nOther aspects I considered include:\n\n* Upgradability: I think it would take about 4-7 years for me to outgrow the 8TB of space of option 1, after which, upgrading would be a bigger hassle as I would need to purchase more 4TB drives, extend the RAID array with those and then use my offsite backup to restore data onto the RAID.   \nIs this right, or are there better solutions to this problem, perhaps one that ensures I maintain two copies of the data throughout the upgrade process?  \nAnother consideration: After this, the 8TB offsite drive could not hold all the data of the RAID, so I would have to upgrade that one too. Could I buy another one and extend it or would it be better to buy a single, larger capacity (let's say 16TB) drive that completely replaces the 8TB one as the offsite drive?\n* Lifespan: The 18TB drives would be enough for me for the next 15-20 years, however, it would not be a wise decision to invest in these drives if they were likely to fail within that time. In that case, I would be much better off investing less at the moment and doing a large-scale upgrade later on.   \nWhat can I expect here? I would only use the drives for storing archive data, occasionally (monthly, at most) powering them on to look at photos. They would otherwise remain powered off and completely disconnected.\n* Mirroring: both options require some sort of mirroring. For this, I'm currently using freefilesync. What do you think about this approach?  I'm comfortable with performing this manually, as I only do it less than once a month, whenever I decide to back up photos from my phone.\n* Skyhawk drives: the 4TB drives that would be used for option 1 are Skyhawk Surveillance drives. I have read many comments about how these sould only be used for CCTV footage as they are more likely to not correct read errors due to the nauture of their firmware, however, I have also seen explanations how this is largely made-up and no evidence exists to support these claims.   \nI'm especially interested in the opinion of those using Skyhawk drives for RAID arrays. Have you encountered any issues attributable to the drives being engineered for CCTV use? \n\nThis is probably my longest tech-advice post ever, thank you very much if you took the time to read through it.\n\nTL;DR:   \n\\- RAID with 1 parity + single disk offsite backup with no parity, or  \n\\- 3 mirrored drives (1 offsite) with +12% better price/TB but 2x the total price and 2x the usable space compared to the first option", "author_fullname": "t2_73ebnj1", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Need Help Choosing a Storage Architecture", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_18rxnid", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1703672612.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[TL;DR at the bottom]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m not new to the concept of data hoarding but have no hands-on experience with NASs, RAID arrays or extremely high capacity HDDs, and thus have some questions regarding which architecture I should choose for my upcoming storage system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently storing my important files (mostly photos and videos) on 2x 3TB drives which are mirrored manually, but I&amp;#39;m starting to fill the drives, and have thus decided to invest in a higher capacity and more redundant solution. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the market pricing where I live, I came up with two options:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3x 4TB drives in RAID with 1 parity + 1x 8TB drive as an offsite backup (no parity there, SMR disk) -&amp;gt; 8TB effective space, ~57 USD/eff.
