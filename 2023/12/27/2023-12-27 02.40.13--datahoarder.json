I would also like as much information as possible to be included in the photos after I download them on hard drives so they are able to see all of the information I add to the photos. Also, I don&amp;#39;t know if this is possible but I would like my family to be able to help me to add relevant information to the photos because I won&amp;#39;t know a lot of the people or locations without them having to buy a subscription but I don&amp;#39;t have any idea if that&amp;#39;s possible.

It provides an alternate way to share your photos and videos **from** your smartphone **to** your preferred cloud storage (iCloud, Google Photos, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) or to your home computer via Wifi while at home. Best of all, it doesn't make file naming an afterthought (as does the iPhone). Instead, when transferring your photos and video files, the app suggests the same nomenclature that I have been using for years (and allows you to customize it). The app correctly names the files using the correct meta data info.\n\n1. Install [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/home) on smartphone  \n2. Install PhotoSyncCompanion on Windows  \n3. Set up app to connect to Windows computer on the same WiFi as smartphone  \n4. Click Recents  \n5. Click Update  \n6. Click New  \n7. Click Computer\n\nIt is fast, uses correct file name nomenclature, can transfer to Windows computer at home inside your WiFi network, or to Google Photos, OneDrive, etc. from anywhere. If your computer is connected via an ethernet cable to your network (as mine is), it's an extra step to set up at the start, but it works. You can manually transfer the photos and videos or set it to auto-transfer at a specific time or  when you arrived at a location (eg, home, work, etc.) and are in WiFi.  \n\n\n**MY PRE-2024 METHOD**  \nPrior to PhotoSync app, I used the following imperfect setup. I set the OneDrive app on my smartphone to automatically backup all the new photos and I videos I recorded. I also had Google Photos do the same. On iPhone, this is not automatic and it can take hours before the sync occurs. I found one can force Google Photos to backup the photos and videos by opening the Google Photos app. But that doesn't see to work with the OneDrive app. I'm not sure how to force OneDrive to sync the files on demand. For the OneDrive version of the files, I mapped it to Windows Explorer so I can easily access my backed up files.\n\n*The naming problem*\n\nPhotos and video files synchronized via Google Photos keep the original name created on the iPhone, for instance, IMG\\_8273.jpg. So if I download this photo from Google Photos, I will need to rename it to the date the photo was taken. By contrast, OneDrive renames the file to the date it was taken, but uses UTC-0 time. While this is accurate, it is not what I want and requires renaming on my Windows 10 computer. I prefer the interface of the Windows application Better File Rename 5 mostly because I have been using it for many years and could easily rename the JPG files to the date the photo was taken. But this application won't work for the MOV files because the iPhone stores the video created date in the meta data field *com.apple.quicktime.creationdate*. Better File Rename 5 can't see that particular meta data. Neither can Advanced Renamed 3.88. Neither can Bulk Rename Utility 3.3.2.0. It's possible that another renamer application with a GUI can do it, but I haven't tested them all. The one renamer software that will do this job properly is the one that scares many people\u2014the command line based but crazy powerful [EXIFtool](https://exiftool.org/).\n\nHere is how to rename iOS-created MOV video files to the date on your Windows 10 computer.\n\n1. Put a copy of the MOV files into a folder in, say, C:\\\\RenamingFolder  \n2. Download ExifTool and place the EXE file in that folder.  \n3. Rename the file to exiftool.exe  \n4. Open Notepad, enter the following code, and save to C:\\\\RenamingFolder with the name Rename file to IPhone video creation date.bat\n\n    exiftool \"-FileName&lt;creationdate\" -d \"%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H-%%M-%%S.%%%%e\" K:\\RenamingFolder\ncmd /k\n\n5.  Double click the bat file and EXIFtool will rename the MOV files to a filename using the correct meta info. \n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nPhotoSync will solve the file naming problem. I love this app. As for the 2023 photos and videos I have not have time to properly rename, the EXIFtool solution will solve that for me. I'll have properly named files using the accurate date and time.\n\nFinally, for the record, I should add that while the format *2024-01-16 17-45-03.jpg* helps organize the files in order, I like to batch add an ending to the files. For instance, if I have a few dozen photos of a birthday, I select them all in Windows Explorer, right click, select Better File Rename from the context menu, and then apply the *Text - Add text to end* command from the menus, and type in with a leading space *Mike's 8th birthday.* So the final file name with be *2024-01-16 17-45-03 Mike's 8th birthday.jpg.*", "author_fullname": "t2_7jhiw", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Workflow: copy iPhone photos and videos to Windows 10 with filenames using the date the photo or video was really created", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "guide", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_18ro2lq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Guide/How-to", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1703640324.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my 2024 workflow for saving photos and videos from my iPhone 14 (iOS 17.1.2) to my Windows 10 computer using the picture taken date or the video created date as the filename in the format &lt;em&gt;2024-01-16 17-45-03.jpg&lt;/em&gt; (or .mov).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USING PHOTOSYNC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI just found out about this invaluable smartphone software.
