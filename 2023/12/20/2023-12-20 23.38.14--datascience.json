My offer also depends on me getting granted the security clearance, which I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d get because of a number of reasons.\n\nI\u2019m attracted to offer 2 because I already know and like the culture of the team/company and being fully remote allows me to be flexible in where I\u2019m living. I\u2019ve been aiming to live in New York and this role would allow me to do that although the salary makes me nervous about budgeting in nyc. However, I\u2019ve also recently started thinking about exploring other cities with a lower COL (ex. Chicago, Austin) that would allow me to save more of my money.\n\nAm I crazy for not wanting to take offer 1 because I don\u2019t like the location and I\u2019m unsure if I can mentally grapple with the impact of the work?", "author_fullname": "t2_kax6yfnsb", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Choosing a new grad job", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "fun", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_18n5zuk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1703111851.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1703108390.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I\u2019m an undergraduate senior who has been job-hunting for the past couple of months for a role after I graduate in the spring. While I\u2019m sad I\u2019m not landing anything huge like $100k+, I\u2019m grateful to still have gotten offers in this job market. I narrowed it down to two that I\u2019m choosing between (both are data scientist/adjacent roles):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offer 1:\n- Research institution (think Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, JHU APL, MIT Lincoln)\n- L/MCOL, office located in the suburbs\n- $95k salary\n- Much of the work is for DOD (offer is contingent on security clearance)\n- Employer would pay for a masters degree&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offer 2:\n- Small/mid-sized advertising and marketing firm\n- Fully remote with offices in big cities\n- $75k with 15-25% target bonus\n- I\u2019ve interned with the firm before\n- Entry-level people tend to get promoted quickly (within 6-18 months)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m leaning towards taking offer 2 even though it pays less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hesitance with offer 1 comes from the fact that I don\u2019t want to have to drive / make a reverse commute to the suburbs. I don\u2019t judge anyone who does work in defense but I also feel ethically conflicted in doing work towards the war industry. My offer also depends on me getting granted the security clearance, which I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d get because of a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m attracted to offer 2 because I already know and like the culture of the team/company and being fully remote allows me to be flexible in where I\u2019m living. I\u2019ve been aiming to live in New York and this role would allow me to do that although the salary makes me nervous about budgeting in nyc. However, I\u2019ve also recently started thinking about exploring other cities with a lower COL (ex. Chicago, Austin) that would allow me to save more of my money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I crazy for not wanting to take offer 1 because I don\u2019t like the location and I\u2019m unsure if I can mentally grapple with the impact of the work?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b026063c-d780-11e7-aba9-0e030591a4b4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "id": "18n5zuk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Unfair-Muscle3393", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/18n5zuk/choosing_a_new_grad_job/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/18n5zuk/choosing_a_new_grad_job/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1195698, "created_utc": 1703108390.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "What would be the best practice to create a data warehouse out dataframes that were created in a juoyter notebook?
