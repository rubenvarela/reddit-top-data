My backup drive (for both of the other drives) is a 5TB portable HDD. Please ignore the lack of 3-2-1 for now.\n\nFor a few years I've been using Acronis True Image 2019, specifically doing incremental backups with weekly full backups, but with my slow, noisy external HDD this got kind of annoying as it would take times on the order of 6 hours to do a full backup each week, and if I put my computer to sleep in the middle of that, it would sometimes cause Acronis to hang or fail the backup.\n\nIn a big whoopsie recently (but also somewhat tangentially), I accidentally emptied my entire backup drive while trying to clear some files with illegal names left over from a horribly failed Linux experiment, which prompted me (tangentially - since that was obviously user error) to look into better backup solutions after it occurred to me that the method of doing full backups and then having a few increments per week is actually extremely inefficient as a long term file history due to multiplication of data.\n\nSo, while reading some reddit posts, I came across Duplicacy, which I think has a really compelling concept in how efficient it is both in space saving and backup time over long backup histories, as large numbers of snapshots can have large intersections which are wholly deduplicated, and every backup after the first is effectively both incremental and full, without any special differences between them in how each snapshot can be read and restored, so I've been trialing the Web UI version.\n\nHowever, I've realized now that Duplicacy doesn't back up system images; only the C: volume, which I think means that restored backups of the Windows drive will not be bootable (it doesn't matter that the backup itself isn't bootable - just the restored files).

My backup drive (for both of the other drives) is a 5TB portable HDD. Please ignore the lack of 3-2-1 for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a few years I&amp;#39;ve been using Acronis True Image 2019, specifically doing incremental backups with weekly full backups, but with my slow, noisy external HDD this got kind of annoying as it would take times on the order of 6 hours to do a full backup each week, and if I put my computer to sleep in the middle of that, it would sometimes cause Acronis to hang or fail the backup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a big whoopsie recently (but also somewhat tangentially), I accidentally emptied my entire backup drive while trying to clear some files with illegal names left over from a horribly failed Linux experiment, which prompted me (tangentially - since that was obviously user error) to look into better backup solutions after it occurred to me that the method of doing full backups and then having a few increments per week is actually extremely inefficient as a long term file history due to multiplication of data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while reading some reddit posts, I came across Duplicacy, which I think has a really compelling concept in how efficient it is both in space saving and backup time over long backup histories, as large numbers of snapshots can have large intersections which are wholly deduplicated, and every backup after the first is effectively both incremental and full, without any special differences between them in how each snapshot can be read and restored, so I&amp;#39;ve been trialing the Web UI version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;ve realized now that Duplicacy doesn&amp;#39;t back up system images; only the C: volume, which I think means that restored backups of the Windows drive will not be bootable (it doesn&amp;#39;t matter that the backup itself isn&amp;#39;t bootable - just the restored files). On top of that, I&amp;#39;ve recently found out about hardlinks and want to make use of them in some of my media libraries, and Duplicacy does not preserve those, instead just backing up multiple copies of the file, whereas I think an image backup would preserve the hardlinks and not duplicate the file?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to make a long story short, is there any backup software currently available for Windows that combines image backups with a clever chunking system for deduplication, for a long backup history on limited storage space, fast backups every time, preservation of bootability and fancy file linking structure, and which won&amp;#39;t implode through a sleep-wake cycle (that last one is less important)?

There are three steps associated with adding to this collection:\n\n1. **Collection**: This involves the act of collecting the files, which could include downloading them, creating them, or finding them offline.\n2. **Storage**: How are the files stored? What data is stored alongside them? Note that self hosted data is a required option.\n3. **Management**: Once the files and associated data are stored, how can you manage them? A self hosted service would be ideal.\n\nThere exist many solutions for the Storage &amp; Management steps, including OS built-in tools such as Windows File Explorer. These solutions are usually called *Digital Asset Management* (DAM) Services.\n\nThere also of course exist many separate solutions for the Collection step, such as web scraping tools like [Gallery-DL](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl) or [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)\n\nHowever, as many of you probably have encountered, it can be difficult to find solutions that work together well. Even if you do find one that works, it often heavily limits your flexibility.\n\nFor example, say you want to incorporate tags as metadata associated with files for querying purposes. Many DAM services allow this functionality, but what happens if you suddenly want to switch DAM services? It may become remarkably difficult if the tags are stored in a confusing proprietary database that you'll have to parse through to get the metadata back out. Or what if you have tags that you parsed using a web scraping tool that you want to import? Some DAM services don't easily allow this and don't let you automate it (no API or access to the database),  and as such you may find yourself going through the process of either automating the input yourself or manually inputting each tag (yikes). What if you also have files from different data streams such as some parsed from online and some from offline? You would have to put it all into the DAM and forget about any different metadata those files might have. Forget about having a local copy you can look through as well in most cases. Many DAMs also don't support some file types.\n\nThere are also issues associated with functionality such as tagging. There is no universally accepted standard for what tags exist and what format they should be in. The closest I've found is the [Public Tag Repository](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/PTR.html) or [Danbooru's Tags (NSFW)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/tags). Note that the PTR is probably the closest as I cannot find a way to have access to Danbooru's tag database. Its database is also a nightmare with around 64 tables in their database and everything in SQL which requires a migration to change the schema of.\n\nAs such, if you want true flexibility you have to find a way to separate the steps and be able to interchange the solutions you use for each. For collection, you should be able to use any method and scrapers that you want. For storage, files need to be stored in a universally accepted way along with their metadata that is stored either in an associated file or a database. Lastly, the management software needs to be completely separate, meaning you can switch DAMs as you please simply through importing and exporting your data. If you make a change to a file in a DAM service, it needs to be reflected in your storage solution.\n\nNote that there are solutions that try to cover all three steps, such as [Hydrus Network](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus) which is a robust solution that acts as a DAM and also as a downloader with users being able to make custom downloaders. However, I've found myself using different downloaders for unsupported sites and struggling to find a way to automate the importing of tags. It also gets difficult when the biggest community made downloaders (e.g. for Danbooru) do not parse everything you want. It also does not support all of the functionalities that someone may want such as easily seeing file children/parents/siblings.\n\nThe only real solution I can think of for this is to store files in a universal file system (simple hierarchical file system such as exFAT) and to store metadata associated with each file's hash in a database that can be flexibly updated to reflect data stored or created in DAM services (exporting files). This means JSON or similar is likely the best option. This solution would also require custom importers and exporters to be made for each DAM service to allow full flexibility. The exporter would need to be able to sync with the universal database. Creating this kind of solution would be difficult and I would like to avoid this if possible. Not to mention if your DAM uses machine learning and likely uses vector databases which would be kinda hard to integrate into JSON.\n\nMy question is if there any tools or standards that accomplish this without needing to create this on my own. Are there existing open source self hosted services that meet this kind of flexibility? Is there an existing standard on what file data there is?\n\nAny help is appreciated. Please feel free to recommend DAMs as I am also looking for better services. [Hydrus Network](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus) is currently my overall choice. If you want to look at criteria that some others have for robust DAMs, [this](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/47756/digital-asset-management-for-photography) is a good post.\n\n**TLDR**: Are there any open source &amp; self hosted Digital Asset Management services that allow for true flexibility (i.e. switching DAM services or for storing different kinds of metadata)?
