am a junior DS at a F500 company with a first 8 months project under my belt, which main\u2019y consisted in classical machine learning for regression, with an optimisation under constraints, and some time series. I took the project from POC to integrating it in a working tool for engineers.\n\nWill be working more on a time series study for 1-2 months, then I have 2 options :\n\nOption A: working on anomaly detection algorithms with a big impact (our team needs to deliver something good in this segment next year). \n\nOption B: LLMs. Well mostly state of the art and evaluating impact of LLMs on our company\u2019s business, finding a use case accordingly and building a simple POC.\n\nBoth seem interesting in their own ways. I\u2019m looking to get meaningful experiences and I am interested in both topics. I know LLMs are hot right now, but anomaly detection is kind of a big thing where I am so I may be able to work with more data and deliver something that\u2019s not yet another POC. \nI want to learn many things, does not know if I should specialize myself yet, but looking to work on things that I like, have real impact, and are great looking on my CV.\n\nAny suggestions ?\n\nEdit :\n\nMore info :\n\nBasically part of my team works on a big data platform for the industry I work in, which gets a lot of data but usually raises too much false anomalies with the current algorithms. Important to know : AD is applied on time series.\n\nAs it\u2019s one of the main products our team is known for, I think I might get a lot of exposure working on it.\n\nAlso, as it is the main product on the team, I am bound to work on AD at some point.\n\nLLM applications might be multiple, like generating a report on the error for an anomaly detection, or other things I could find during a state of the art.\n\nAs said by a few comments, I think impact is better than just doing things that will go in the trash.

I took the project from POC to integrating it in a working tool for engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will be working more on a time series study for 1-2 months, then I have 2 options :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option A: working on anomaly detection algorithms with a big impact (our team needs to deliver something good in this segment next year). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option B: LLMs. Well mostly state of the art and evaluating impact of LLMs on our company\u2019s business, finding a use case accordingly and building a simple POC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both seem interesting in their own ways.
