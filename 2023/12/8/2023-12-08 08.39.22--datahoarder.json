Of which most I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to figure out which is which.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally I planned on using the laptops but as my last purchase was more than 10 years ago I don&amp;#39;t see a use in keeping any of these laptops for a future use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before I get rid of these laptops and a mess load of hard drives I have I need to know if there&amp;#39;s any data on them that I want. Especially family photos of which I know I have a ton. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can I access a hard drive (I&amp;#39;m expecting to use an external hard drive reader connected to my current Chromebook) but thoroughly no that I&amp;#39;ve accessed the data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the past I try to access a hard drive I know had data on it because the power supply stopped working. However since there was a login screen I think it prevented me from seeing the data through an external reader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And closing what I want to do is take a hard drive see the data on it copy the data over to a larger hard drive. (Which wouldn&amp;#39;t be hard considering I&amp;#39;ve seen 12 TB drives at this point) and then delete the date on the original hard drive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also be glad to give away these laptops without the hard drives because I&amp;#39;m trying to cut down on the amount of electronic junk I have. I&amp;#39;ve even got an HP touchpad somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d14a812c-b94e-11eb-b72a-0ee8a79b8cab", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18d6fdd", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JerseyJoyride", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/18d6fdd/help_ive_got_a_dozen_or_so_laptops_and_even_more/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18d6fdd/help_ive_got_a_dozen_or_so_laptops_and_even_more/", "subreddit_subscribers": 717287, "created_utc": 1701985267.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Does anyone know a way to organize your Twitter Likes and bookmarks? \n\nI would like to categorize my Likes and bookmarks for easy access. \n\nI believe the api is too expensive now to do this.

I would like software RAID vs hardware RAID just in case the computer decides to toss its cookies.

The dream would be the album capabilities of Google Photos, but only a client-side program. I tracked down a version of Picasa 3 and downloaded that and, while pretty decent, it doesn't support any modern file types.
