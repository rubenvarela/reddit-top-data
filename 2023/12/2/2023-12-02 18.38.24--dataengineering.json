Would it make sense to pursue some type of career coach/mentor? If so, what is the best way to go about finding that?*\n\n\n**More about me:**\n\nIn 2019, I got masters in Business Analytics and started as a BA at a tech startup, where I used SQL to build charts and dashboards in a BI tool. Current state, I've worked up to \"analytics manager\" at the same company, which is an inflated way of saying I'm the main person here that:\n\n\n- 'manages' our ETL tool (Fivetran, which is pretty much just point and click)\n\n- 'manages' our dbt project and BI tool(s)/transitions when leadership decides on a new one (building dashboards for internal and external use), etc\n\n- I also use R for larger scale scripts/automation, but my most advanced/used tech skills are SQL/dbt and BI 'development', if you can call it that\n\n- No direct reports, no python, I don't know what Spark or Airflow are, and most of my CI/CD knowledge comes from watered down dbt automations\n\n\n**Where I feel stuck/ranting:**\n\nManager started as BizOps Lead but over time has taken strategy/admin/general hiring responsibilities, and become more and more resistant to participating/understanding the technical BizOps/BI side of our department. We hired another analyst early in '21 who technically was more professionally mature than me when hired, but has not ramped in skill with me and it still feels like there is an expectation that I spend a lot of time coaching and mentoring even though they do not report to me.\n\n\nSince I started the company went from ~30 people to ~65+, and my team has been 2-3. I estimate we're about 50% software engineers, but my role feels so isolated from the technical side of our company. We've acquired other SaaS products in the last year that leadership, product, and clients need reported on, but I don't have the resources/manpower to get it all done cleanly and in the timeframe expected. I rely on SWEs to verify my understanding of specific tables/columns, but I'm understandably instructed not to take up much of their time.\n\n\nI feel technically more advanced than my team, but far behind our SWEs. Since we were a young startup when I joined I developed our SQL standards, built our dbt project and git flows from scratch, etc. Most of the analytics processes in place were designed by me but with limited feedback/collaboration/prior exposure, it could honestly be trash. I'm not able to develop deeper DE skills due to the division and have a lot of gaps, so I'm not sure what I am or could be based on my skillset. I want a change, but I don't know what type of role I should be looking for or working towards.\n\n\nAnyone else been in a relatable career spot? What'd you do?
