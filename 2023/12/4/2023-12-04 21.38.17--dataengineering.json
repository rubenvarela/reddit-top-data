lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do I start when it comes to creating technical documentation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;m drawing everything as a DAG using GraphViz and linking every node and edge in the graph to a set of requirements, use cases, or support documentation in Excel, but, that&amp;#39;s pretty much it, and I don&amp;#39;t know what documentation to build and when.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have work closely with any other software developers other than the red team and someone else who works on reporting automation, so, it&amp;#39;s a bit tricky to learn what exactly to provide, when and where.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;ve been busy building all of this stuff, I haven&amp;#39;t really documented anything, and, am kind of regretting it - I should have focused on design and documentation earlier on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,

[This](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&amp;edition=2023&amp;id=1081) is the link to the program website.\n\nThe program covers topics such as data analytics, machine learning, and is heavily inclined to operational research. Operational research is the discipline of applying advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. The program includes the following courses on operational research:\n\n- Applied Decision Optimisation\n- Time Series\n- Heuristic Optimisation\n- Introduction to Stochastic Optimisation\n- Advanced Stochastic Optimisation\n\nI am curious to know how these courses would benefit me in any role in the data domain. Would they improve or complement my existing data skills? Would they give me a competitive edge in the data field?\n\nThe program website lists some of the possible career paths for graduates of this program, such as:\n\n- business consultants\n- business analysts\n- data analysts\n- business intelligence &amp; analytics consultants\n- metrics &amp; analytics specialists\n- analytics associates\n- solution architects\n- business process analysts\n- management consulting associates\n- operational research consultants\n\nI would appreciate your opinions and insights on this program and its relevance to data engineering.
