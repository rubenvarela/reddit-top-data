Obviously I do understand that in a 2 month timeframe it&amp;#39;s impossible to reach a good level but it&amp;#39;s still worth than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any tips,hints,suggestions,opinions will be very much accepted and definitely help me a lot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S: To spare you some time, Have I ever worked with Big data or huge datasets?
