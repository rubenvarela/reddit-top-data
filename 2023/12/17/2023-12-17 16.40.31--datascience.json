I&amp;#39;m keen to considering switching to a DS/DA role. As part of the process of trying to better understand the role, Would you mind briefly share how you divide your day? Also, mentioning your industry and company size would be really helpful. Bonus: what part do you hate the most :) ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30% Identifying Problems with Stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% Data Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% Feature Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10% Model Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% Explaining Results to Stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to your insights! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#1a1a1b", "id": "18k5duf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deanlee805", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/18k5duf/day_to_day_task_of_a_data_scientist_analyst/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/18k5duf/day_to_day_task_of_a_data_scientist_analyst/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1189526, "created_utc": 1702774742.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm following this sub for quite some time and wanted go ask your opinion about what you think are good sectors to breach in with a background in econometrics and Data Science.\n\nNext year I will finish my master in econometrics and already signed a contract for an internship at a big company in Data Science (Germany).
