Working with non-technical stakeholders- about 70% of my interactions was with product/program teams. remember feeling overwhelmed in those initial onboarding 1:1s while being bombarded with acronyms and product jargon. it took me 2 months to get up to speed.  one of the things you learn quickly is understanding their goal helps you do your job better.  \nMy first project was comparing the user experience for a new product that was under development to replace a legacy product, and the product team wanted to confirm that certain key metrics did favor the new product and reflect it\u2019s intended benefits. Given my new-hire energy/naivete, I did lots of in-depth research (even bought Pearl\u2019s causal inference book), spent weekends reading/thinking about it and finally drafted a publication-quality document detailing causal graphs, mediation modeling, hypothesis tests etc etc\u2026. On the day, I go into the meeting expecting an invigorating discussion of my analysis.. only to see the PMs gloss over all that detail and move straight to discussing what the delta-metric meant for them. my action item from that meeting was to draft a 1-pager with key findings to distribute among leadership. I clearly remember my reaction after that meeting- *that was it?*\n\n2. Leadership principles - Granted this is my first tech experience, but I always presumed a company\u2019s marketing material is sufficiently decoupled from its daily operations to the point where the vision/mission/culture code doesn\u2019t actually propagate to your desk. but leadership principles at amazon are genuinely used as guide-markers for daily decision making. I would encounter an LP being the basis of a doc section, meeting discussion or piece of employee feedback almost every week. One benefit for example, is the template it provides for evaluating candidates after job interviews.\n\n3. Writing is greatly valued practice at Amazon, and considered a forcing function for clarity of thought. I saw the benefits from writing my own docs but more so in reading other people\u2019s docs. its also way more efficient by allowing multiple threads of comments/feedback to happen in parallel during the reading session vs a QnA session with a few people hogging all the time. On a related note, i wondered on multiple occasions how senior execs enjoy their work given all they do is read docs all day with super-human efficiency (not that they read the whole doc of-course but still..).\n\n4. self-marketing and finding good projects - this was one of those vague truths that nobody will tell you but everyone slowly realizes esp in big companies, or atleast was true in my case. Every person needs to look after their own career progression by finding good projects, surround themselves with the right people (starting with manager) and of-course deliver the actual work. it might be easy to only focus on 3 believing 1 and 2 are out of control but i feel they\u2019re equally important. example- one of my active contribution areas was for a product that, somewhere along the way, got pushed to a sister org, but I was wedged deep into the inner-workings that they had me continue working on it throughout my time. At the time, I felt important to be irreplaceable but what it really meant was that this work was not aligned with MY org's goals. doh! guess which org\u2019s metrics will mean more to your perf review panel come the end of the year.\n\n5. more projects are self-initiated than i realized. piggy-backing on the previous point about good projects- there is lesser well-thought-through strategy around you than it seems but also more opportunity to find the projects that interest you with potential for outsized impact. example- my most impactful project was a self-initiated one launched to production with a definitively large impact on the product metrics... and it didn't begin as an \u2018over-the-line\u2019 item (i.e. planned in the quarterly planning cycle) with a dedicated PM, roadmaps etc. it was just me finding an inefficiency and building a solution and even got it published in an internal conference. this may not be ideal but shows its possible to find areas for impact.   \nI also know of at-least 2 other self-initiated projects that evolved to be core to the org\u2019s efforts. This aligns with why companies hold hackathons, google has its 20%-time allowance etc. it also makes you wonder, how much of the OKR, OP, 3YAP etc are actually driving innovation vs designed to create an artificial sense of planning. (jargon expansion- objective key results, operational planning, 3 year action plan)\n\nthat's it. for me, this was a rewarding experience and grateful for the people I got to work with.

Built this so you can just authenticate and test without having to fuss with numpy, pinecone, etc.\n\nThe only thing you do is put dictionaries with a name and text key, then search your embeddings instance. We return anything you stick in there with it too for your programming pleasure - think dates, page numbers, file names, whatever.\n\nYou can just... Build chat bots that are pretty smart like this for next to nothing by reading in your docs or whatever. It's cheap and incredibly effective. I know next to nothing about how to preprocess data for this thing, I've tried different sizes of chunks, lines, sentences and haven't found a one size fits all solution (other than more gpt to summarize) but - just try it, it's cheap as hell and there's so much you can do. Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!\n\nFor you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you're ready.\n\nI know it's small, but little abstractions make life better.

Built this so you can just authenticate and test without having to fuss with numpy, pinecone, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing you do is put dictionaries with a name and text key, then search your embeddings instance. We return anything you stick in there with it too for your programming pleasure - think dates, page numbers, file names, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can just... Build chat bots that are pretty smart like this for next to nothing by reading in your docs or whatever. It&amp;#39;s cheap and incredibly effective. I know next to nothing about how to preprocess data for this thing, I&amp;#39;ve tried different sizes of chunks, lines, sentences and haven&amp;#39;t found a one size fits all solution (other than more gpt to summarize) but - just try it, it&amp;#39;s cheap as hell and there&amp;#39;s so much you can do. Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I&amp;#39;d love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you&amp;#39;re ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s small, but little abstractions make life better. Anything we can do to lower the barrier to experimentation is worth doing.

I failed all the interviews where they required a take home task. Then I found a DS job where they just asked technical questions but without a hands-on component. I was hired.\n\nSo my first job as a data scientist went OK, and I stayed in a company for little over a year. Other data scientists there were not much better than me and I feel like the expectations were pretty low. It was mainly re-working some old code and writing documentation. In fact, although I learned a little, I was bored most of the time. There was never any new modelling. \n\nI landed another role recently where they also only had a technical interview but no tasks. I actually made a few mistakes in the interview and was surprised that they offered me a job. I am now 2 weeks in and am pretty scared. This job is whole another level.

Most of the examples I come across has a label (interaction data, explicit score etc.) therefore they can calculate metrics.

No CS/DS background just taking programming and analytics courses. Looking at what to do next in my career and get a masters degree.\n\nIm in a weird spot where I like things around data and technology and am good at math and economics. I also obviously see technology is becoming  more and more relevant so I want to get better at that too and utilize that.\nI'm very much a generalist learner and am interested in positon that allow me to combine all this different domain knowledge which made me consider DS or Quant finance.\n\n\n\nThe only thing is I just hate the software development part of it. It's never been difficult for me to understand the logic of code and writing pseudocode. I understand the concepts, the math and all but I suck at the actual application, compiling it to working code. For me, 1/10 time is spent coming up with a solution. 9/10 is debugging.\nI forget the rules and syntax of how its supposed tobe written. Mix up a bunch of different concepts. Alot of vernacular and coding terms I am unaware of and can't recall. I know what i want to write i just forget how to write it. In the math/CS/engineering related courses I've taken I've done fairly well when I wasn't required to write code and it was all math/theory heavy, yet barely manage pass when I had to write actual code.\nIt's also soemthing I'm very very slow at getting better at a site recently realized.\n\nOn top of that, I learnt I'm not the person who codes for the sake of coding. I care very little about writing \"beautiful code\" or code optimization and nor is it something I want to learn the nitty gritty of. I dont care about side projects or anything like that. I'm not a software developer at heart and in fact find most of the qctual coding part very painful. I'm a very broad based learner and I want to so things where the result is obvious.\n\n\nFor example, as a civil engineer, I chose land development in mining as it was the most broad stream in the most braod field, and i WANT to actually learn the interplay between different subdisclplines like structural, transportstion, Geotechnical, water engineering and as a land development guy you see all that. That's the stuff I love and it makes me want to do better and keeps my job interesting. I would've been miserable as a pure structural or Geotechnical engineer.(kinda how i see pure software engineering)\n\nI also have that feeling when it comes to other subjects like finance, math, technology and economics \nI want to learn the concepts, the technicalities and most importantly how all this stuff interplays together. I couldn't ever be a pure software engineer and I have absolutely no such feeling or desire of digging deeper when it comes to software development or writing code and learning all the related aspects as I find it hyperfixated and to removed from the big picture and other topics of finance, math etc for me to enjoy.\n\n\nI really only see it as a tool in my arsenal like Microsoft excel, adobe, ArcGIS, etc to be used towards something greater and to be able to accomplish my job. That's really it.\n\n\nSo given this, data science I saw as my best option. Would that possibly be the right fit for me? (No data analytics suggestions please)\n\n\n\nTldr: Good at core math, statistics, economics but suck at writing code (not the understanding or logic part of it.

No CS/DS background just taking programming and analytics courses. Looking at what to do next in my career and get a masters degree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im in a weird spot where I like things around data and technology and am good at math and economics. I also obviously see technology is becoming  more and more relevant so I want to get better at that too and utilize that.\nI&amp;#39;m very much a generalist learner and am interested in positon that allow me to combine all this different domain knowledge which made me consider DS or Quant finance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing is I just hate the software development part of it. It&amp;#39;s never been difficult for me to understand the logic of code and writing pseudocode. I understand the concepts, the math and all but I suck at the actual application, compiling it to working code. For me, 1/10 time is spent coming up with a solution. 9/10 is debugging.\nI forget the rules and syntax of how its supposed tobe written. Mix up a bunch of different concepts. Alot of vernacular and coding terms I am unaware of and can&amp;#39;t recall. I know what i want to write i just forget how to write it. In the math/CS/engineering related courses I&amp;#39;ve taken I&amp;#39;ve done fairly well when I wasn&amp;#39;t required to write code and it was all math/theory heavy, yet barely manage pass when I had to write actual code.\nIt&amp;#39;s also soemthing I&amp;#39;m very very slow at getting better at a site recently realized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I learnt I&amp;#39;m not the person who codes for the sake of coding. I care very little about writing &amp;quot;beautiful code&amp;quot; or code optimization and nor is it something I want to learn the nitty gritty of. I dont care about side projects or anything like that. I&amp;#39;m not a software developer at heart and in fact find most of the qctual coding part very painful. I&amp;#39;m a very broad based learner and I want to so things where the result is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, as a civil engineer, I chose land development in mining as it was the most broad stream in the most braod field, and i WANT to actually learn the interplay between different subdisclplines like structural, transportstion, Geotechnical, water engineering and as a land development guy you see all that. That&amp;#39;s the stuff I love and it makes me want to do better and keeps my job interesting. I would&amp;#39;ve been miserable as a pure structural or Geotechnical engineer.(kinda how i see pure software engineering)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have that feeling when it comes to other subjects like finance, math, technology and economics \nI want to learn the concepts, the technicalities and most importantly how all this stuff interplays together. I couldn&amp;#39;t ever be a pure software engineer and I have absolutely no such feeling or desire of digging deeper when it comes to software development or writing code and learning all the related aspects as I find it hyperfixated and to removed from the big picture and other topics of finance, math etc for me to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really only see it as a tool in my arsenal like Microsoft excel, adobe, ArcGIS, etc to be used towards something greater and to be able to accomplish my job. That&amp;#39;s really it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So given this, data science I saw as my best option. Would that possibly be the right fit for me? (No data analytics suggestions please)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr: Good at core math, statistics, economics but suck at writing code (not the understanding or logic part of it. Just the actual writing, debugging, syntax, language rules etc) and really have no desire to become an expert software developer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At my core I&amp;#39;m a jack of all trades, very broad based learner that likes to combine different subject matters and see how it interplays rather then hyperfixating on one thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I do data science as it&amp;#39;s one of the broadest fields?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "99f9652a-d780-11e7-b558-0e52cdd59ace", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "10iseh5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aldjfh", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/10iseh5/not_a_codersoftware_developer_at_heart_but_enjoy/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10iseh5/not_a_codersoftware_developer_at_heart_but_enjoy/", "subreddit_subscribers": 840054, "created_utc": 1674417011.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
