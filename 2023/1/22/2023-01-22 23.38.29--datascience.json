Working with non-technical stakeholders- about 70% of my interactions was with product/program teams. remember feeling overwhelmed in those initial onboarding 1:1s while being bombarded with acronyms and product jargon. it took me 2 months to get up to speed.  one of the things you learn quickly is understanding their goal helps you do your job better.  \nMy first project was comparing the user experience for a new product that was under development to replace a legacy product, and the product team wanted to confirm that certain key metrics did favor the new product and reflect it\u2019s intended benefits. Given my new-hire energy/naivete, I did lots of in-depth research (even bought Pearl\u2019s causal inference book), spent weekends reading/thinking about it and finally drafted a publication-quality document detailing causal graphs, mediation modeling, hypothesis tests etc etc\u2026. On the day, I go into the meeting expecting an invigorating discussion of my analysis.. only to see the PMs gloss over all that detail and move straight to discussing what the delta-metric meant for them. my action item from that meeting was to draft a 1-pager with key findings to distribute among leadership. I clearly remember my reaction after that meeting- *that was it?*\n\n2. Leadership principles - Granted this is my first tech experience, but I always presumed a company\u2019s marketing material is sufficiently decoupled from its daily operations to the point that the vision/mission/culture code doesn\u2019t actually propagate to your desk. but leadership principles at amazon are genuinely used as guide-markers for daily decision making. I would encounter an LP being the basis of a doc section, meeting discussion or piece of employee feedback almost every week. One benefit for example, is the template it provides for evaluating candidates after Job interviews.\n\n3. Writing is greatly valued practice at Amazon, and considered a forcing function for clarity of thought. I saw the benefits from writing my own docs but more so in reading other people\u2019s docs. its also way more efficient by allowing multiple threads of comments/feedback to happen in parallel during the reading session vs a QnA session with a few people hogging all the time. On a related note, i wondered on multiple occasions how senior execs enjoy their work given all they do is read docs all day with super-human efficiency (not that they read the whole doc of-course but still..).\n\n4. self-marketing and finding good projects - this was one of those vague truths that nobody will tell you but everyone slowly realizes esp in big companies, or atleast was true in my case. Every person needs to look after their own career progression by finding good projects, surround themselves with the right people (starting with manager) and of-course deliver the actual work. it might be easy to only focus on 3 believing 1 and 2 are out of control but i feel they\u2019re equally important. example- one of my active contribution areas was for a product that, somewhere along the way, got pushed to a sister org, but I was wedged deep into the inner-workings that they had me continue working on it throughout my time. At the time, I felt important to be irreplaceable but what it really meant was that this work was not aligned with what MY org's goals. doh! guess which org\u2019s metrics will mean more to your perf review panel come the end of the year.\n\n5. more projects are self-initiated than i realized. piggy backing on the previous point about good projects- there is lesser well-thought-through strategy around you than it seems but also more opportunity to find the projects that interest you with potential for outsized impact. example- my most impactful project was a self-initiated one launched to production with a definitively large impact on the product metrics... and it didn't begin as an \u2018over-the-line\u2019 item (i.e. planned in the quarterly planning cycle) with a dedicated PM, roadmaps etc. it was just me finding an inefficiency and building a solution and even got it published in an internal conference. this may not be ideal but shows its possible to find areas for impact.   \nI also know of at-least 2 other self-initiated projects that evolved to be core to the org\u2019s efforts. This aligns with why companies hold hackathons, google has its 20%-time allowance etc. it also makes you wonder, how much of the OKR, OP, 3YAP etc etc are actually driving innovation vs designed to create an artificial sense of planning. (jargon expansion- objective key results, operational planning, 3 year action plan)\n\nthat's it. for me, this was a rewarding experience and grateful for the people I got to work with. I hope some of this useful to some of you folks, especially to junior data scientists, or an interesting read at the least. \n\nI plan to continue writing and building my portfolio, learning full-stack web dev and learn some other skills (like marketing). follow me on twitter ([https://twitter.com/sangyh2](https://twitter.com/sangyh2)) if interested :)", "author_fullname": "t2_4m1ivn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "my DS experience at Amazon", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_10ivzyj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1674426675.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1674425913.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2.5 year stint at Amazon ended this week and I wanted to write about my experience there, primarily as a personal reflection but also sharing hoping might it be an interesting read.. also curious to hear few other experiences in other companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i came up with 5 points that I found were generally interesting looking back or where I learned something useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with non-technical stakeholders- about 70% of my interactions was with product/program teams. remember feeling overwhelmed in those initial onboarding 1:1s while being bombarded with acronyms and product jargon. it took me 2 months to get up to speed.  one of the things you learn quickly is understanding their goal helps you do your job better.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy first project was comparing the user experience for a new product that was under development to replace a legacy product, and the product team wanted to confirm that certain key metrics did favor the new product and reflect it\u2019s intended benefits.
