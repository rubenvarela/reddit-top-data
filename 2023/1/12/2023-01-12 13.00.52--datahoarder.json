Instead of making a local copy I decided to fetch the data back from Backblaze, and since I'm located in Europe, instead of ordering drives and paying duty for them I opted for the download method. (A series of mistakes, I'm aware, but it all seemed like a good idea at the time).\n\nThe process is deceptively simple if you've never actually tried to go through it - either download single files directly, or select what you need and prepare a .zip to download later.\n\nThe first thing you'll run into is the 500GB limit for a single .zip - a pain since it means you need to split up your data, but not an unreasonable limitation, if a little on the small side.\n\nThen you'll discover that there's absolutely zero assistance for you to split your data up - you need to manually pick out files and folders to include and watch the total size (and be aware that this 500GB is decimal). At that point you may also notice that the interface to prepare restores is... not very good - nobody at Backblaze seems to have heard the word \"asynchronous\" and the UI is blocked on requests to the backend, so not only do you not get instant feedback on your current archive size, you don't even see your checkboxes get checked until the requests complete.\n\nBut let's say you've checked what you need for your first batch, got close enough to 500GB and started preparing your .zip. So you go to prepare another. You click back to the Restore screen and, if you have your backup encrypted, it asks you for the encryption key again. Wait, didn't you just provide that? Well, yes, and your backup is decrypted, but on server 0002, and this time the load balancer decided to get you onto server 0014. Not a big deal. Unless you grabbed yourself a coffee in the meantime and now are staring at a login screen again because Backblaze has one of the shortest session expiration times I've seen (something like 20-30 minutes) and no \"Remember me\" button. This is a bit more of a big deal, or - as you might find out later - a very big deal.\n\nSo you prepare a few more batches, still with that same less than responsive interface, and eventually you hit the limit of 5 restores being prepared at once. So you wait. And you wait. Maybe hours, maybe as much as two days. For whatever reason restores that hit close to that 500GB mark take ages, much more than the same amount of data split across multiple 40-50 GB packs - I've had 40GB packages prepared in 5-6 minutes, while the 500GB ones took not 10, but more like 100 times more. Unless you hit a snag and the package just refuses to get prepared and you have to cancel it - I haven't had that happen often with large ones, but a bunch of times with small ones.\n\nYou've finally got one of those restores ready though, and the seven day clock to download it is ticking - so you go to download and it tells you to get yourself a Backblaze Downloader. You may ignore it now and find out that your download is capped at about 100-150 MBit even on your gigabit connection, or you may ignore it later when you've had first hand experience with the downloader. (Spoilers, I know). Let's say you listen and download the downloader - pointlessly, as it turns out, since it's already there along with your Backblaze installation.\n\nYou give it your username and password, OTP code and get a dropdown list of restores - so far, so good. You select one, pick a folder to download to, go with the recommended number of threads, and start downloading.\n\nAnd then you realize the downloader has the same problem as the UI with the \"async\" concept, except Windows really, *really* doesn't like apps hogging the UI thread. So 90 percent of the time the window is \"not responding\", the Close button may work eventually when it gets around to it, and the speed indicator is useless. (The progress bar turns out to be useless too as I've had downloads hit 100% with the bar lingering somewhere three quarters of the way in). If you've made a mistake of restoring to your C:\\ drive this is going to be even worse since that's also where the scratch files are being written, so your disk is hit with a barrage of multiple processes at once (the downloader calls them \"threads\"; that's not quite telling the whole story as they're entirely separate processes getting spawned per 40MB chunk and killed when they finish) writing scratch files, and the downloader appending them to your target file. And the downloader constantly looks like it's hanged, but it has not, unless it has because that happens sometimes as well and your nightly restore might have not gotten past ten percent.\n\nBut let's say you've downloaded your first batch and want to download another - except all you can do with the downloader is close it, then restart it, there's no way to get back to the selection screen. And you need to provide your credentials again. And the target folder has reset to the Desktop again. And there's no indication which restores you have or have not already downloaded.\n\nAnd while you've been marveling at that the unzip process has thrown a CRC error - which I really, *really* hope is just an issue with the zipping/downloading process and the actual data that's being stored on the servers is okay. If you've had the downloader hang on you there's a pretty much 100% chance you'll get that, if you've stopped and restarted the download you'll probably get hit by that as well, and even if everything went just fine it may still happen just because. If you're lucky it's just going to be one or two files and you can restore them separately, if you're not and it plowed over a more sensitive portion of the .zip the entire thing is likely worthless and needs to be redownloaded.\n\nSo you give up on the downloader and decide to download manually - and because of that 100-150 MBit cap you get yourself a download accelerator. Great! Except for the \"acceleration\" part, which for some reason works only up to some size - maybe that's some issue on my side, but I've tried multiple ones and I haven't gotten the big restores to download in parallel, only smaller ones.\n\nAnd even if you've gotten that download acceleration to work - remember that part about getting signed out after 30 minutes? Turns out this applies to the download link as well. And since download accelerators reestablish connections once they've finished a chunk, said connections are now getting redirected to the login page. I've tried three of those programs and neither of them managed to work that situation out, all of them eventually got all of their threads stuck and were not able to resume, leaving a dead download. And even if you don't care for the acceleration, I hope you didn't spend too much time setting up a queue of downloads (or go to bed afterwards), because that won't work either for the same reason.\n\nIronically, the best way to get the downloads working turned out to be just downloading them in the browser - setting up far smaller chunks, so that the still occasional CRC errors don't ruin your day, and downloading multiple files in parallel to saturate the connection. But it still requires multiple trips to the restore screen, you can't just spend an afternoon setting up all your restores because you only have seven days to download them and you need to set them up little by little, and you may still run into issues with the downloads or the resulting zip files.\n\nNow does it mean Backblaze is a bad service? I guess not - for the price it's still a steal, and there are other options to restore. If you're in the US the USB drives are more than likely going to be a great option with zero of the above hassle, if you can eat the egress fees B2 may be a viable option, and in the end I'm likely going to get my files out eventually. But it seems like a lot of people who get interested in Backblaze are in the same boat as me - they don't want to spend more than the monthly fee, may not have the deposit money or live too far away for the drive restore, and they might've heard of the restore process being a bit iffy but it can't be that bad, right?\n\nWell, it's exactly as bad as above, no more, no less - whether that's a dealbreaker is in the eye of the beholder, but it's better to know those things about the service you use before you end up depending on it for your data. I know the Backblaze team has been speaking of a better downloader which I'm hoping will not be vaporware, but even that aside there are so many things that should be such easy wins to fix - the session length issue, the downloader not hogging the UI thread, the artificial 500 GB limit - that it's really a bit disappointing that the current process is so miserable.", "author_fullname": "t2_epug6", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Backblaze large restore experience (is miserable)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "backup", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_109kd3j", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 206, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Backup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 206, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1673481815.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have my 40TB hoard of data backed up to Backblaze, and with the recent acquisition of two more drives I needed to wipe my storage pool to switch it over from a simple one to a parity one.

I was tasked with removing HDDs from old PCs at work, and was able to snag a Dell X9M3X Motherboard (LGA 1155, DDR3), an intel i3-3220, 4 x 4Gb DDR3 DIMMs, a bunch of SATA Data cables, and a stock CPU Cooler, which I assume will be sufficient for a NAS. I also have a spare 550W PSU. Otherwise, I will need a case, boot drive, and storage drives\n\nI'm planning on getting a cheap 250 gb SSD as boot drive and 2 WD Red 4Tb HDDs in Raid1 as storage. My main concern is with my motherboard and case compatibility. It is an old Dell Mobo, and I'm worried about the front panel connectors being compatible.

simple.  I have two Win10 work PCs:  A sw development workstation, and a DAW (music workstation).\n\nBoth of these computers operate from a 1TB system drive, although the music workstation has an additional 2TB drive for sample libraries (that doesn't need to be backed up).  So the requirement is simple, I want network backups of both computers that can be restored in case of failure. \n\n[What I've *been* doing is manually saving projects to a 2tb usb drive.  Online software repositories also contain my software work so that is mostly backed up to the cloud.]\n\nThere is an old PC (4790k) that I intend to use as plex server and as NAS.   It has four drives: 250gb ssd, 2x 1tb hdd, 1x 2tb hdd.  I would like to \"mirror\" the working drives of my two PCs onto the 1TB hdds.\n\nBut the question, is it really worth the hassle of setting up a seprate NAS and coordinating network backups?  I could install one of each 1TB drive into the two computers, and the backups could be performed locally.   Availability isn't that important so I'm not really looking at a raid, just some sort of automated script that backs up the system.  I don't know what software is available to do this.\n\nHere is what I'm thinking:\n\n1) Can I set up a Windows \"storage space\" on the 3rd PC, using the 1tb drives as mirrors for each of the work PCs?\n\n2) How can it be automated in a completely reliable fashion to perform nightly backups without having the server powered up 24/7 (it only needs to be on when performing a backup)?  \n\n2b) I said \"nightly\" in previous question, is there a way to network mirror a drive to that it is updated in relatively real time without hurting performance?\n\n3) I am assuming the mirrors are written with the same sequence of changes that were made to the primary drive, so that it doesn't have to bottom up copy the whole drive every night.  How do I synchronize these backups with online cloud storage so that I don't have to upload the entire disk image(s)?\n\n4) Will this result in an image that can be 100% reliably restored to a drive should it fail and need replacement?\n\nAny help or push in right direction appreciated.  It is my opinion that people/myself tend to over complicate things.  The reason I don't want local raids is that if one of the computers(notebook) is lost or stolen, I will have a backup in a separate box at home, and online.\n\nI know I could install TrueNas Core on the third computer, but the benefit of this hasn't been made apparent over a Win10 server.

I don&amp;#39;t know what software is available to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is what I&amp;#39;m thinking:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Can I set up a Windows &amp;quot;storage space&amp;quot; on the 3rd PC, using the 1tb drives as mirrors for each of the work PCs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) How can it be automated in a completely reliable fashion to perform nightly backups without having the server powered up 24/7 (it only needs to be on when performing a backup)?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2b) I said &amp;quot;nightly&amp;quot; in previous question, is there a way to network mirror a drive to that it is updated in relatively real time without hurting performance?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I am assuming the mirrors are written with the same sequence of changes that were made to the primary drive, so that it doesn&amp;#39;t have to bottom up copy the whole drive every night.  How do I synchronize these backups with online cloud storage so that I don&amp;#39;t have to upload the entire disk image(s)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Will this result in an image that can be 100% reliably restored to a drive should it fail and need replacement?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help or push in right direction appreciated.  It is my opinion that people/myself tend to over complicate things.  The reason I don&amp;#39;t want local raids is that if one of the computers(notebook) is lost or stolen, I will have a backup in a separate box at home, and online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I could install TrueNas Core on the third computer, but the benefit of this hasn&amp;#39;t been made apparent over a Win10 server.  Also plan to use it as Plex server, so would like to keep it windows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,
