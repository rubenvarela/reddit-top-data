I stopped the NC VM, increased the storage on the main drive a bit, and extended the partition with GParted live to cover the 20 gigabytes I just added. Oddly enough, when I booted the VM, Nextcloud didn't report that the main drive had any more available storage than before, and the docker Collabora container couldnt be created because there wasn't enough storage.

Due to some other concerns I've got a reason now to learn about how docker containers work, kubernetes deployments, and a few other things so I've taken the opportunity to do more with my home server in a journey of personal enrichment (or pain, take your pick).  To that end I'm looking to see if there is a better way to do a few things that I've been having trouble finding alternatives for myself:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\`1) My usual method of interacting with the server is using KiTTY (and putty in the past) from my main PC (Windows) to ssh over and doing everything that way.  Recently found and tried WeTTY, but that's essentially the same thing just via a browser tab.  However in looking up guides and information recently I saw a person using VS Code and doing some amazing things, like having a file explorer style window, having a seperate window pop up when editting files instead of doing everything in a single terminal session, and a few other cool things.\n\nI did download and install VS Code to try and see if it was easy to implement that sort of functionality myself, but that was several hours of wasted effort and not worth it.  Just wondering if there is a more efficient tool than a simple ssh terminal window out there that isn't also a full blown IDE or complicated enterprise management tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) While I've used docker containers in the past, it's literally just been a couple that were super easy to setup and run with no effort.  Now I've been learning docker compose and have a file of about 15 containers.  I'm planning to split those up into a few separate projects (like the core static NAS stuff I need, stuff to play with and edit regularly, others I've solidified but aren't super critical to restore if something goes wrong, etc...).  So I went looking for a tool to make that all easier to edit, run, and manage beyond just simply throwing them in separate folders with their own compose files.  To that I end I tried yacht and portainer.\n\nPortainer was terrible.  It to require you to do way too much that I don't need to maintain all the functionality it provides.  It has several options unavailable in it's UI to advertise it's paid functionality that I don't need or care to see the notices about.  And it added stuff to my docker deployments that I didn't know nor care to figure out why it was doing that.\n\nYacht was much better but the dashboard regularly just didn't work (although usually a page refresh fixed it).  The variable feature didn't work with the docker-compose like feature thus I'd need to redo my entire setup as I've got an env file for a lot of repeatable entries.  And it was quite laggy in accessing the individual container status pages, log files, and other nice features that make it worth using over just doing everything manually.  Also one of the dockers I installed via portainer, then deleted, and tried to recreate in Yacht would also have all the extra options added by portainer included when I created the container from scratch, which made no sense and I couldn't figure out why that was happening.\n\nHonestly something like Yacht but less latency in the UI and the variable system working would be perfect.  Is there something like that out there?  Really just want a nice frontend for management multiple docker-compose files and seeing the status of running containers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) My form of version control and tracking is keeping my files on an SMB share, loading it up with Notepad++ on my Windows PC, and enabling the feature to have it automatically create a backup and track lines which have changed.  Which to be honest is working perfectly fine for me and I'm not really looking for more.  However now that I'm doing more with my server I thought it'd be worthwhile to try self-hosting something like gitea and learning a bit about version control and management through git.\n\nHowever when I deployed the gitea container I had a couple of issues that just instantly put me off.  One I left the defaults which had the local root URL set to \"localhost\" and I was connecting to it initially from my Windows PC and it flashed up a huge error message when I did that and there was no obvious explanation of why that was necessary.

Due to some other concerns I&amp;#39;ve got a reason now to learn about how docker containers work, kubernetes deployments, and a few other things so I&amp;#39;ve taken the opportunity to do more with my home server in a journey of personal enrichment (or pain, take your pick).  To that end I&amp;#39;m looking to see if there is a better way to do a few things that I&amp;#39;ve been having trouble finding alternatives for myself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;`1) My usual method of interacting with the server is using KiTTY (and putty in the past) from my main PC (Windows) to ssh over and doing everything that way.  Recently found and tried WeTTY, but that&amp;#39;s essentially the same thing just via a browser tab.  However in looking up guides and information recently I saw a person using VS Code and doing some amazing things, like having a file explorer style window, having a seperate window pop up when editting files instead of doing everything in a single terminal session, and a few other cool things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did download and install VS Code to try and see if it was easy to implement that sort of functionality myself, but that was several hours of wasted effort and not worth it.  Just wondering if there is a more efficient tool than a simple ssh terminal window out there that isn&amp;#39;t also a full blown IDE or complicated enterprise management tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) While I&amp;#39;ve used docker containers in the past, it&amp;#39;s literally just been a couple that were super easy to setup and run with no effort.  Now I&amp;#39;ve been learning docker compose and have a file of about 15 containers.  I&amp;#39;m planning to split those up into a few separate projects (like the core static NAS stuff I need, stuff to play with and edit regularly, others I&amp;#39;ve solidified but aren&amp;#39;t super critical to restore if something goes wrong, etc...).  So I went looking for a tool to make that all easier to edit, run, and manage beyond just simply throwing them in separate folders with their own compose files.  To that I end I tried yacht and portainer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Portainer was terrible.  It to require you to do way too much that I don&amp;#39;t need to maintain all the functionality it provides.  It has several options unavailable in it&amp;#39;s UI to advertise it&amp;#39;s paid functionality that I don&amp;#39;t need or care to see the notices about.  And it added stuff to my docker deployments that I didn&amp;#39;t know nor care to figure out why it was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yacht was much better but the dashboard regularly just didn&amp;#39;t work (although usually a page refresh fixed it).  The variable feature didn&amp;#39;t work with the docker-compose like feature thus I&amp;#39;d need to redo my entire setup as I&amp;#39;ve got an env file for a lot of repeatable entries.  And it was quite laggy in accessing the individual container status pages, log files, and other nice features that make it worth using over just doing everything manually.  Also one of the dockers I installed via portainer, then deleted, and tried to recreate in Yacht would also have all the extra options added by portainer included when I created the container from scratch, which made no sense and I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out why that was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly something like Yacht but less latency in the UI and the variable system working would be perfect.  Is there something like that out there?  Really just want a nice frontend for management multiple docker-compose files and seeing the status of running containers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) My form of version control and tracking is keeping my files on an SMB share, loading it up with Notepad++ on my Windows PC, and enabling the feature to have it automatically create a backup and track lines which have changed.  Which to be honest is working perfectly fine for me and I&amp;#39;m not really looking for more.  However now that I&amp;#39;m doing more with my server I thought it&amp;#39;d be worthwhile to try self-hosting something like gitea and learning a bit about version control and management through git.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However when I deployed the gitea container I had a couple of issues that just instantly put me off.  One I left the defaults which had the local root URL set to &amp;quot;localhost&amp;quot; and I was connecting to it initially from my Windows PC and it flashed up a huge error message when I did that and there was no obvious explanation of why that was necessary.  I&amp;#39;m sure I could figure it out if I dug hard enough, but the very reason for that being a thing was confusing and nonsensical to me.  And it also required you to setup user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering this is a little self hosted setup for just me I don&amp;#39;t need to deal with another user management system, if I wanted to deal with that I&amp;#39;d just sign up for a github account and play with that.
