Are my reasons valid?**\n\nHi all,\n\nI've been working as a data professional for about 4.5 years now and have been thinking about making the pivot to SWE for over a year, just have been spending my time learning more + building my portfolio. The reason is that I find myself enjoying writing code to automate things and create apps more than I really do linear regressions and analyses really. I also took some Udemy courses a while ago and really loved learning general python programming more so than I did a python for ML course.\n\nI've also been feeling jaded by my work experiences too, which is also partly why I want to switch. I feel like the problem's I've been facing is that I end up doing a variety of random tasks because people hire a data person without really understanding what that expertise means or have unrealistic expectations from. I have done what I can to *bring* ideas and improve workflows to each place I've worked, but there are limits to how creative I can get depending on the organization. In my last job, I was in a data team with a lot of people who shared a similar background as me (masters or doctorate degrees in epidemiology or biostatistics)-these were very talented people, no doubt, but did not really have a formal programming background or data science knowledge outside of methods used in academia. I got asked to do a reporting task at my old job which was an insanely chaotic process done manually for years  by previous analysts (copying and pasting data cleaned into SAS into excel templates) with really terrible documentation practices. I taught myself enough R to fully automate this task-something that took more than 40+ hours every month, into ZERO hours. I also used tools like RMarkdown to create very professional looking documentation with explanations and code.\n\nWhen I tried to teach this to my colleagues so I won't be the only person doing this, it was going over their heads. I tried to use visual diagrams (flowcharts) and wrote every tiny detail in the documentation, which was unlike the minimalist documentation I received when I was given this task as a new employee. It still was not clicking. My colleagues admitted that programming is something that's not really their thing. I stayed on as a consultant for my team because these reports were considered critical and I would rather be paid than answer questions for my team for free. In retrospect, I regret this because the dependency on me prolonged longer than I expected. There was a new director of the data team who got hired and I showed her all the documents and told her I'm planning to end my consultancy now that she's hired. She told me a few days later she'd like to \"offer me an opportunity to extend my contract\" (?) to \"honor my work\". I told her I really don't want to stay on any longer and would like this work to be taken over. When I trained her on this stuff, I realized she had never used R, SQL or even knew Excel pivot tables. I don't mean to sound mean or pretentious about my skills because I too was somebody who didn't know this stuff at one time, but I also found it unbelievably unfair and felt a director should have at least some knowledge or ability to take over this work. I felt like my boss who hired people (not a data person) just didn't know the right skills required for the job.\n\nAfter my work experiences, I feel like I'm much more of a software person at heart than a data person and also don't have the resilience and patience anymore to deal with unrealistic ideas from supervisors, but not sure if I'm not giving data science a chance-perhaps my experiences may be different in a private/tech company?

Based on what the learning model is trying to do, you would need to consult with statisticians on determining the quality of the data and if it is even valid, and if you should be generating a random sample, or using all raw data. As far as the learning model itself, I have formulated a few suggestions for the dataset itself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One of the first ideas that came to mind is excluding &amp;#39;sensitive&amp;#39; demographic data, like age, sex, race, etc, which may work in some instances, but could also backfire.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For example, one way of reducing bias is to use the demographics to pre-filter the data and ensure groups are accurately represented.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One thing you can do is create two datasets and run them through a machine learning model, one with the demographics, and one without, and then compare the results, audit for bias, and see if there is anything you can improve.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In some cases, it is also possible to only include variables relevant to the topic, but ultimately could be harmful as you lose more and more data points.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s also possible that you could pick a subset of the data to do things like, ensure minority populations were represented or alternatively create a dataset to represent each option, run each through the model with known outcomes, and evaluate and/or train it against itself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I also found that it must be necessary for there to be input and opinions on the dataset given by multiple professionals of different backgrounds to prevent any bias from the creator.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, there must always be frequent checkups to monitor if any bias has arisen and if so, ways that it can be removed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all that I have for now, but I would appreciate any and all feedback or suggestions that you all may have for me!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1070xuj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Remote_Event_4290", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1070xuj/ways_to_reduce_bias_in_ml_datasets/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1070xuj/ways_to_reduce_bias_in_ml_datasets/", "subreddit_subscribers": 835415, "created_utc": 1673228335.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Does anyone know of an article or video that explains specifically the different data pipeline techniques and tools as well as when to use each one?\n\nI understand this is a bit of a rookie question but just getting a jumping-off point here would be extremely helpful.
