Are my reasons valid?**\n\nHi all,\n\nI've been working as a data professional for about 4.5 years now and have been thinking about making the pivot to SWE for over a year, just have been spending my time learning more + building my portfolio. The reason is that I find myself enjoying writing code to automate things and create apps more than I really do linear regressions and analyses really. I also took some Udemy courses a while ago and really loved learning general python programming more so than I did a python for ML course.\n\nI've also been feeling jaded by my work experiences too, which is also partly why I want to switch. I feel like the problem's I've been facing is that I end up doing a variety of random tasks because people hire a data person without really understanding what that expertise means or have unrealistic expectations from. I have done what I can to *bring* ideas and improve workflows to each place I've worked, but there are limits to how creative I can get depending on the organization. In my last job, I was in a data team with a lot of people who shared a similar background as me (masters or doctorate degrees in epidemiology or biostatistics)-these were very talented people, no doubt, but did not really have a formal programming background or data science knowledge outside of methods used in academia. I got asked to do a reporting task at my old job which was an insanely chaotic process done manually for years  by previous analysts (copying and pasting data cleaned into SAS into excel templates) with really terrible documentation practices. I taught myself enough R to fully automate this task-something that took more than 40+ hours every month, into ZERO hours. I also used tools like RMarkdown to create very professional looking documentation with explanations and code.\n\nWhen I tried to teach this to my colleagues so I won't be the only person doing this, it was going over their heads. I tried to use visual diagrams (flowcharts) and wrote every tiny detail in the documentation, which was unlike the minimalist documentation I received when I was given this task as a new employee. It still was not clicking. My colleagues admitted that programming is something that's not really their thing. I stayed on as a consultant for my team because these reports were considered critical and I would rather be paid than answer questions for my team for free. In retrospect, I regret this because the dependency on me prolonged longer than I expected. There was a new director of the data team who got hired and I showed her all the documents and told her I'm planning to end my consultancy now that she's hired. She told me a few days later she'd like to \"offer me an opportunity to extend my contract\" (?) to \"honor my work\". I told her I really don't want to stay on any longer and would like this work to be taken over. When I trained her on this stuff, I realized she had never used R, SQL or even knew Excel pivot tables. I don't mean to sound mean or pretentious about my skills because I too was somebody who didn't know this stuff at one time, but I also found it unbelievably unfair and felt a director should have at least some knowledge or ability to take over this work. I felt like my boss who hired people (not a data person) just didn't know the right skills required for the job.\n\nAfter my work experiences, I feel like I'm much more of a software person at heart than a data person and also don't have the resilience and patience anymore to deal with unrealistic ideas from supervisors, but not sure if I'm not giving data science a chance-perhaps my experiences may be different in a private/tech company?
