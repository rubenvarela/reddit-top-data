However, I've been facing issues with it and I'd like to share them because these issues wasted enough of my time, and this is the ethos of this sub. Maybe I'm wrong; make what you will out of this :-)\n\n- **The straw that broke that back - The introduced paid subscription for self-hosted users (money isn't the problem, really)**: After having introduced their \"paid subscription\" for the self-hosted plan (yes, you heard that right, you have to pay for self-hosted now, and it won't work anymore without a key, so you're locked out), it's become impossible to rely on the software. They were nice enough to offer me a \"free key\", which they offer for free to those who had been using the software before they introduced self-hosted subscription... well, good luck getting it. Because their email server is listed as spam by many spam lists services for some reason, I simply couldn't receive that email after more than a week... and hence...\n- **Your notes are not yours anymore**: Since they introduced the subscription, this made me realize how little control I have over my notes. You have no control over your notes almost at all. Because I failed in activating my notes software, I failed to have any control over my notes for over a week. All their \"special note types\", like checklists (which are a given in markdown-based note-taking) stopped working (even though I'm hosting the extensions myself on my server). I can't fix typos. I can't update any notes. Everything fell apart! I can't take formatted notes anymore. Basically my notes are not mine, even though I'm hosting them, because the software that opens them is not free. It's licensed and I need to have the proper license to use it (or rebuild the code myself and remove that), which brings me to the next point\n- **Proprietary solutions for everything**: For some reason everything in Standard Notes is proprietary yet open-source at the same time. All solutions are reinventions of the same solutions to problems that have been already solved. Your note-taking software is basically a plain-text-editor. Then, anything more you need to do is a proprietary add-on. You wanna make a checklist? Proprietary extension. You wanna have some code highlighting? Proprietary. You wanna use markdown? Proprietary. Take a look at their \"Super notes\". They look like wonderful markdown notes! But it's all proprietary nonsensical json underneath that doesn't work anywhere else. You type markdown, but it's saved as json. You can't even change the pre-formatted code-block types natively because... it's not really markdown. You can't export your notes because they're not markdown (except one by one by hand in the app, which offers markdown format), and if you can export them, they won't work out of the box, because everything is proprietary, so you have to write your own json parser (which doesn't exist out there as of the time of writing this for Super Notes). **You want to upload files?** File uploads work with proprietary solutions, either with FileSafe (which you need a separate WebDAV server for, just for the files, in addition to everything else) or their own internal (new) file upload system, which isn't inherently compatible with anything related to the notes, so it's totally separate. Even worse, because of the bad design around all this, even if you have notes that are \"protected\" (need password for access, hence highly secret), that protection doesn't really apply to the files attached to the note, and you can see the files in a separate list! Everything is proprietary and once anything goes out of the plan (subscription problem, etc), everything breaks, and all your work stops, no more note-taking, or even edits.\n- **The self-hosted server is complex**: It seems that they adapted the server solution of their users to self-hosted. Basically, the easiest way to think about this is how Bitwarden is to Vaultwarden. Bitwarden is a huge, sophisticated solution that consumes lots of memory and resources because it's built for huge infrastructures. Standard Notes backend is quite the same. It has two SQL databases (which they promised to reduce to one)... it has a caching server, API gateway, file server, web server, authentication, and other things. I think there's more than 10 services running in their docker containers. That's not bad by itself... but it's a huge burden to maintain all that and to get it to work. And then because of this, the maintenance of this huge infrastructure makes the cost of maintaining it bigger, leading to \"needing to fund this\" by making the self-hosted service a paid-subscription... How many of you host notes for more than 500 people to require this amount of scaling? Or even 5 people, to need all this infrastructure? Just like Vaultwarden... a simple executable with a database and authentication is more than enough and is even fast enough. After all, the syncing server is a glorified WebDAV server.\n- **Bonus: Fragmentation**. While I was suffering and exporting my data from Standard Notes to Joplin, I simply failed to download the only one file I had uploaded with the new files system (that I've been explaining to people how to use). Why? I've got no idea. This is the problem I mentioned before about proprietary solutions combined with server complexity in action. But you see, the notes are separate from files in every way, so you could have notes working for weeks, but then files fail some time earlier for some reason, and you'll never notice until you're in the middle of your work, and you need the data, and you never get it... better stop working and start debugging. Now I have to dig to see what's going on with that thing. Wish me luck. (Update: I failed. Luckily I was able to retrieve that file from a backup).\n\nBut does it mean Standard Notes is bad? Absolutely not. It's very nice in its own way, for absolute beginners who don't care about self-hosting (in my opinion), which is why I thought this whole self-hosted subscription is bad. But from all I mentioned above, it has close to zero interoperability or upgradability or compatibility with existing solutions and is fully proprietary in everything it does. I'm prepared to sacrifice the niceties in it to have a piece of mind that I will be able to export my notes to simple markdowns by using something like Joplin... and I'll be able to run a simple server that doesn't use tons of services just to host less users than a single-hand finger-count.\n\nI'm also sacrificing having encrypted notes locally. I basically split my notes into those that need to be secret, and I used other tools to write them down, and those that need to be flexible, and I'm using Joplin for that.\n\nAnd if you're the Standard Notes staff reading this, I'm sorry. I tried really hard to stay. But I can't hand my data control to the whims of your volatile decisions and proprietary solutions, because the value of data is in its accessibility; that's the ethos of self-hosting things. And I'll say that I donated and was happy to donate before the fiasco of locking me out of the software capabilities as if I'm using Microsoft Windows.\n\nHope these issues get addresses some day in the future.
