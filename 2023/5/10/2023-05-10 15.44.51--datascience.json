What can I do to get the job?\n\nAnd the answer is simple, yet really hard: stand out.\n\nTo be clear - this isn't just simple tactical advice: this isn't meant to imply \"you can just zhuzh up your resume a bit and you're good to go!\". \n\nAnd that's the reason I decided to make this post - because \"standing out\" is something you need to start planning for early in your process, from the time you select a school and major, through the activities, internships and jobs that you take, all the way through how you position yourself and your resume, and finally how you engage with potential employers.\n\nWith that said, here are some key items/decisions that you will make where a focus on standing out may make a difference:\n\n**Choice of college**\n\nThis one isn't hard - your choice college, fair or not, will matter. There are still a lot of both companies and individuals that think that the best talent can only be found in the best colleges.\n\nHaving said that - there are two nuances here:\n\n* You have to think of tiers. The difference between Berkeley at #20 and Michigan at #25 as an overall school? Not terribly meaningful. The difference between Berkeley at #20 and UT Austin at #38? More meaningful. The difference between #20 Berkeley and #83 Iowa? Pretty substantial. So when you're looking at cost to attend, that is worth keeping in mind - it makes sense to pay up proportional to the tier improvement you're looking at, but not just for individual spots. \n* Both overall ranking and ranking in your specific major can matter. Like, Yale is ranked #16 as a computer science undergrad school. But it's fucking Yale. Texas A&amp;M is ranked 43rd, but Texas A&amp;M is the second largest school in one of the largest states in the country. That carries a lot of weight with it. All that to say - it's important to consider both rankings when making a choice, because especially if you run into hiring managers that aren't coming from your same background (common in data science) they may not have the perception of your school based on your major, but rather overall.\n\n**Choice of major - especially grad school**\n\nThis is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people: employers care a lot less about what specific things you learned in college than they do about how challenging your experience was. Most employers look at school - especially grad school - as a measuring stick for how hard can you push, how hard you can be challenged, and how much effort you can put into things. \n\nA MS in DS or Analytics is fundamentally a much easier program than a MS in CS. A 1-year MS in Stats without a thesis is fundamentally a much easier progra than a 2 year MS in Stats with a thesis requirement. Getting a PhD in theoretical physics is going to stand out more than getting a 6 month online certification in data science from IBM. \n\nYou may say \"hey, I learned all the things I'm going to need to do in this job, so I am qualified - why does my employer care whether or not I learned super complicated things on top of it that I won't even use?\".\n\nFor the same reason that middle aged dads everywhere buy corvettes when they turn 50 - because they would like to know that they could go 150mph if they wanted to, even if they never will. It's not a good reason, but when faced with the option of hiring someone who does just what you need them to do vs. hiring someone who could do much more - you're choosing the latter.\n\nSo choose accordingly. If you go the path of least resistance - i.e., the degree that is easiest/most convenient to get, odds are that will make it more challenging to stand out in an application process. \n\n**Resume**\n\nThis is kind of a complete open world in terms of how you can stand out, but at the end of the day, there are two types of things you want to convey:\n\n1. That your passion for this topic/area is greater than your peers. This can look like extracurriculars associated with the topic, personal projects, volunteering, etc.\n2. That you have skillsets that your peers don't. This can show up as participating in activities, being a member of certain groups, doing personal projects that highlight that skillset, etc.\n3. That your personality is unique - and ideally that your soft skills are beyond your peers. This one is trickier to do, but again - extracurriculars, group memberships, sports, etc., matter here.\n\nSome of this stuff isn't nearly as important once you have work experience, but when all that's on your resume is your education and internships/unrelated jobs, it is much more important to figure out a way to stand out - and you have to get creative.", "author_fullname": "t2_3epw0pud", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Advice for entry-level DS applicants: figure out how to stand out", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_13dsp2z", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "seniorflair", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1683729680.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current DS market has let to a pretty shitty situation for entry-level data scientists: after years of exponential growth in the number of DS programs, the job market came crashing down, and the first jobs to get axed?

Financial institutions need to use cutting-edge technology to optimize processes and meet the latest market demands. But the implementation of technologies in banking is still in its early stages. However, banks using AI and ML are quickly going to overtake their competitors. So far, technology has been the most affected on security systems and streamlined customer services. And these are keys to business success in this area.\n\nLet\u2019s see what you can get from implementing technologies in the banking area.\n\n# Chatbots for Customer Support with NLP\n\nConversational AI technologies for banking are widespread nowadays. Chatbots are becoming more popular in providing businesses with high customer engagement and reducing the burden on operators. Accordingly, in this way, it reduces the engagement of human resources. But are they now perfect? Not always.\n\nIn recent years, the banking industry increasingly implements [NLP](https://amazinum.com/insights/what-is-nlp-and-how-it-is-implemented-in-our-lives/) chatbots and has focused on customer experience. It allows for providing a conversational banking system with a high degree of personalization. These chatbots meet the customers\u2019 needs in a minimal period of time, remembering previous experiences. Data analysis helps to determine the similarity of requests and gives the advantage of anticipating the client\u2019s need and solving his problem correctly. Using the [customer sentiment analysis model (NLP)](https://amazinum.com/insights/customer-sentiment-analysis/) can provide the most correct interaction with the client, satisfying his needs and leaving only positive emotions. It is the most successful example that helps financial institutions improve customer service.\n\nCustomer Segmentation for Personalized Offers\n\nCustomer segmentation gives you an advantage in understanding every customer. Also, it is useful for aligning relevant strategies and tactics to meet their distinctive needs and receive more profits. You can reach out to customers in the most fitting way, having as a basis their interests, spending habits, budgets, preferences, and buying patterns. And when you interact with customers based on these things, they believe you care. This naturally increases their level of trust and satisfaction with your services.\n\nUsing clustering as a [machine learning](https://amazinum.com/machine-learning-services/) technique, you can do this automatically and with large volumes of data. Receiving analytical data helps to make subsequent decisions and further implement your strategy. The most common are usually personalized offers about different types of cards and their benefits, based on the previous activities of the client. But the strategy of personalized cashback offers is becoming the most popular now. **People spend more than they planned to satisfy their needs and at the same time, they are satisfied with your services.**\n\n# Forecasting Customer Demand for ATMs and Optimizing Their Operation\n\n[Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/atm-automated-teller-machine/) provide many distinct conveniences: cash in hand, account balance information, deposit capabilities for cash, and other financial transactions. But the main advantage is that they are found almost everywhere.\n\nRelative to the location of the ATM, you can predict the demand for withdrawing cash and bills, which are most common in the region. For example, if an ATM is located near a shopping center, it is logical to assume that there will be the most frequent withdrawals of large amounts of bills. If the ATM is in a residential area, large bills are not so often used. In this way, it is possible to predict the periodicity of filling the ATM with cash and to optimize the circulation of bills in relation to demand.\u00a0\n\n[How to do it?](https://amazinum.com/contact/)\n\nWe can collect ATM transaction data and analyze it to create an optimal ATM refill strategy. This will create convenience for users and prevent situations when cash runs out. **Clients receive convenient service and the bank has an advantage over competitors.**\n\n[Read more.](https://amazinum.com/insights/technologies-for-banking-new-level/?utm_source=smm&amp;utm_medium=technologies-for-banking-new-level&amp;utm_campaign=smm)", "author_fullname": "t2_rvx6jkhe", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Technologies for Banking: New Level", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_13dnq0x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1683718008.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banking landscape is just beginning to change.
