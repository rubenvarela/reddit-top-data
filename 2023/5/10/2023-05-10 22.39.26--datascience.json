Entry-level ones.\n\nThat means that even more than before this crash, the imbalance of candidates to job openings is really, really daunting, which has led to a huge volume of people with no DS experience asking two questions:\n\n1. I know that I can do the job - why am I not getting the job?\n2. What can I do to get the job?\n\nAnd the answer is simple, yet really hard: stand out.\n\nTo be clear - this isn't just simple tactical advice: this isn't meant to imply \"you can just zhuzh up your resume a bit and you're good to go!\". \n\nAnd that's the reason I decided to make this post - because \"standing out\" is something you need to start planning for early in your process, from the time you select a school and major, through the activities, internships and jobs that you take, all the way through how you position yourself and your resume, and finally how you engage with potential employers.\n\nWith that said, here are some key items/decisions that you will make where a focus on standing out may make a difference:\n\n**Choice of college**\n\nThis one isn't hard - your choice college, fair or not, will matter. There are still a lot of both companies and individuals that think that the best talent can only be found in the best colleges.\n\nHaving said that - there are two nuances here:\n\n* You have to think of tiers. The difference between Berkeley at #20 and Michigan at #25 as an overall school? Not terribly meaningful. The difference between Berkeley at #20 and UT Austin at #38? More meaningful. The difference between #20 Berkeley and #83 Iowa? Pretty substantial. So when you're looking at cost to attend, that is worth keeping in mind - it makes sense to pay up proportional to the tier improvement you're looking at, but not just for individual spots. \n* Both overall ranking and ranking in your specific major can matter. Like, Yale is ranked #16 as a computer science undergrad school. But it's fucking Yale. Texas A&amp;M is ranked 43rd, but Texas A&amp;M is the second largest school in one of the largest states in the country. That carries a lot of weight with it. All that to say - it's important to consider both rankings when making a choice, because especially if you run into hiring managers that aren't coming from your same background (common in data science) they may not have the perception of your school based on your major, but rather overall.\n\n**Choice of major - especially grad school**\n\nThis is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people: employers care a lot less about what specific things you learned in college than they do about how challenging your experience was. Most employers look at school - especially grad school - as a measuring stick for how hard can you push, how hard you can be challenged, and how much effort you can put into things. \n\nA MS in DS or Analytics is fundamentally a much easier program than a MS in CS. A 1-year MS in Stats without a thesis is fundamentally a much easier progra than a 2 year MS in Stats with a thesis requirement. Getting a PhD in theoretical physics is going to stand out more than getting a 6 month online certification in data science from IBM. \n\nYou may say \"hey, I learned all the things I'm going to need to do in this job, so I am qualified - why does my employer care whether or not I learned super complicated things on top of it that I won't even use?\".\n\nFor the same reason that middle aged dads everywhere buy corvettes when they turn 50 - because they would like to know that they could go 150mph if they wanted to, even if they never will. It's not a good reason, but when faced with the option of hiring someone who does just what you need them to do vs. hiring someone who could do much more - you're choosing the latter.\n\nSo choose accordingly. If you go the path of least resistance - i.e., the degree that is easiest/most convenient to get, odds are that will make it more challenging to stand out in an application process. \n\n**Resume**\n\nThis is kind of a complete open world in terms of how you can stand out, but at the end of the day, there are two types of things you want to convey:\n\n1. That your passion for this topic/area is greater than your peers. This can look like extracurriculars associated with the topic, personal projects, volunteering, etc.\n2. That you have skillsets that your peers don't. This can show up as participating in activities, being a member of certain groups, doing personal projects that highlight that skillset, etc.\n3. That your personality is unique - and ideally that your soft skills are beyond your peers. This one is trickier to do, but again - extracurriculars, group memberships, sports, etc., matter here.\n\nSome of this stuff isn't nearly as important once you have work experience, but when all that's on your resume is your education and internships/unrelated jobs, it is much more important to figure out a way to stand out - and you have to get creative.", "author_fullname": "t2_3epw0pud", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Advice for entry-level DS applicants: figure out how to stand out", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_13dsp2z", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "seniorflair", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1683729680.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current DS market has let to a pretty shitty situation for entry-level data scientists: after years of exponential growth in the number of DS programs, the job market came crashing down, and the first jobs to get axed? Entry-level ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means that even more than before this crash, the imbalance of candidates to job openings is really, really daunting, which has led to a huge volume of people with no DS experience asking two questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I know that I can do the job - why am I not getting the job?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What can I do to get the job?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the answer is simple, yet really hard: stand out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be clear - this isn&amp;#39;t just simple tactical advice: this isn&amp;#39;t meant to imply &amp;quot;you can just zhuzh up your resume a bit and you&amp;#39;re good to go!&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the reason I decided to make this post - because &amp;quot;standing out&amp;quot; is something you need to start planning for early in your process, from the time you select a school and major, through the activities, internships and jobs that you take, all the way through how you position yourself and your resume, and finally how you engage with potential employers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, here are some key items/decisions that you will make where a focus on standing out may make a difference:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choice of college&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one isn&amp;#39;t hard - your choice college, fair or not, will matter. There are still a lot of both companies and individuals that think that the best talent can only be found in the best colleges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having said that - there are two nuances here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have to think of tiers. The difference between Berkeley at #20 and Michigan at #25 as an overall school? Not terribly meaningful. The difference between Berkeley at #20 and UT Austin at #38? More meaningful. The difference between #20 Berkeley and #83 Iowa? Pretty substantial. So when you&amp;#39;re looking at cost to attend, that is worth keeping in mind - it makes sense to pay up proportional to the tier improvement you&amp;#39;re looking at, but not just for individual spots. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Both overall ranking and ranking in your specific major can matter. Like, Yale is ranked #16 as a computer science undergrad school. But it&amp;#39;s fucking Yale. Texas A&amp;amp;M is ranked 43rd, but Texas A&amp;amp;M is the second largest school in one of the largest states in the country. That carries a lot of weight with it. All that to say - it&amp;#39;s important to consider both rankings when making a choice, because especially if you run into hiring managers that aren&amp;#39;t coming from your same background (common in data science) they may not have the perception of your school based on your major, but rather overall.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choice of major - especially grad school&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people: employers care a lot less about what specific things you learned in college than they do about how challenging your experience was. Most employers look at school - especially grad school - as a measuring stick for how hard can you push, how hard you can be challenged, and how much effort you can put into things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A MS in DS or Analytics is fundamentally a much easier program than a MS in CS. A 1-year MS in Stats without a thesis is fundamentally a much easier progra than a 2 year MS in Stats with a thesis requirement. Getting a PhD in theoretical physics is going to stand out more than getting a 6 month online certification in data science from IBM. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may say &amp;quot;hey, I learned all the things I&amp;#39;m going to need to do in this job, so I am qualified - why does my employer care whether or not I learned super complicated things on top of it that I won&amp;#39;t even use?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the same reason that middle aged dads everywhere buy corvettes when they turn 50 - because they would like to know that they could go 150mph if they wanted to, even if they never will. It&amp;#39;s not a good reason, but when faced with the option of hiring someone who does just what you need them to do vs. hiring someone who could do much more - you&amp;#39;re choosing the latter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So choose accordingly. If you go the path of least resistance - i.e., the degree that is easiest/most convenient to get, odds are that will make it more challenging to stand out in an application process. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a complete open world in terms of how you can stand out, but at the end of the day, there are two types of things you want to convey:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That your passion for this topic/area is greater than your peers. This can look like extracurriculars associated with the topic, personal projects, volunteering, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That you have skillsets that your peers don&amp;#39;t. This can show up as participating in activities, being a member of certain groups, doing personal projects that highlight that skillset, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That your personality is unique - and ideally that your soft skills are beyond your peers. This one is trickier to do, but again - extracurriculars, group memberships, sports, etc., matter here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of this stuff isn&amp;#39;t nearly as important once you have work experience, but when all that&amp;#39;s on your resume is your education and internships/unrelated jobs, it is much more important to figure out a way to stand out - and you have to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "PhD | Sr. Director of Data Science | Tech", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "13dsp2z", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dfphd", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/13dsp2z/advice_for_entrylevel_ds_applicants_figure_out/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13dsp2z/advice_for_entrylevel_ds_applicants_figure_out/", "subreddit_subscribers": 895914, "created_utc": 1683729680.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I work with SQL to clean data to help with data migration to my company\u2019s new system and put it into a readable format.
