{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": "t3_13owkwq", "dist": 25, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "My Synologys (all for home / personal use) are now on DSM 7.2, so I thought it\u2019s time to post about my testing on &gt;200TB volumes on low end Synologys.\n\nThere are a lot of posts here and elsewhere of folks going to great expense and effort to create volumes larger than 108TB or 200TB on their Synology NAS. The 108TB limit was created by Synology nearly 10 years ago when their new DS1815+ was launched at the time when 6TB was the largest HDD - 18 bays x 6 = 108TB.\n\nNow those same 18 bays could have a pool of 18 x 26TB = 468TB, but still the old limits haven't shifted unless you live in the Enterprise space or are very wealthy.\n\nSo many posts here go into very fine (and expensive) detail of just which few Synology NAS can handle 200TB volumes - typically expensive XS or RS models with at least 32GB RAM and the holy grail of the very few models that can handle Peta Volumes (&gt;200TB) which need a min of 64GB RAM.\n\nBut the very top end models that can handle Peta Volumes are very handicapped - no SHR which is bad for a typical home user and no SSD cache - bad for business especially - plus many more limitations - e.g., you have to use RAID6, no Shared Folder Sync etc.\n\nBut very few questions here about why these limits exist. There is no Btrfs or ext4 valid reason for the limits. Nor in most cases (except for the real 16GB limit with 32bit CPUs) are there valid CPU or hardware architecture reasons.\n\nI've been testing &gt;200TB volumes on low end consumer Synology NAS since last December on a low value / risk system (I've since gone live on all my Synology systems). So, a few months ago I asked Synology what the cause was of these limits. Here is their final response:\n\n\"I have spoken with our HQ and unfortunately they are not able to provide any further information to me other than it is a hardware limitation.\n\nThe limitations that they have referred to are based 32bit/64bit, mapping tables between RAM and filesystems and lastly, CPU architecture. They have also informed me that other Linux variations also have similar limitations\".\n\nAnalysing this statement - we can strip away the multiple reference to 32/64 bit and CPU architecture which we all know about.   That is a 32bit CPU really is restricted to a 16TB volume, but that barely applies to most modern Synology NAS which are all 64bit.   That leaves just one item left in their statement - mapping tables between RAM and filesystems.  That's basically inodes and the inodes cache.    The inode cache contains copies of inodes for open files and for some recently used files that are no longer open. Linux is great at squeezing all sorts of caches into available RAM.   If other more important tasks need RAM, then Linux will just forget some of the less recently accessed file inodes.  So this is self-managing and certainly not a hardware limit as Synology support states.\n\nSynology states that this is  \"a hardware limitation\".    This is patently not true as demonstrated below:\n\nHere is my 10-year-old DS1813+ with just 4GB RAM (the whole thing cost me about \u00a3350 used) with 144TB pool all in one SHR1 volume of 123.5TiB. No need for 32GB of RAM or buying an RS or XS NAS. No issues, no running out of RAM (Linux does a great job of managing caches and inodes etc - so the Synology reason about mapping tables is very wrong).\n\n[10 year-old DS1813+ with just 4GB of RAM and \\&gt; 108TB volume](https://preview.redd.it/0vyk4otqfa1b1.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc6457ff7741f0386730be6e992a66bb13a5eb7a)\n\nAnd the holy grail - Peta Volumes. Here is one of my DS1817+ with 16GB RAM and a 252TB pool with a single SHR1 volume of 216.3TiB.   As you can see this NAS is now on DSM7.2 and everything is still working fine.\n\n![img](5zl22wtzfa1b1 \"\nDS1817+ with 16GB RAM and &gt; 200TB volume\")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some folks are mixing up Volume Used with Total Volume Size](https://preview.redd.it/wlr8baiama1b1.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3ca5186716ce23238d25933f3f4cc27a9cf12a3c)\n\nI'm not using Peta Volumes with all their extra software overhead and restrictions - just a boring standard Ext4 / LVM2 volume. I've completed 6 months of testing on a low risk / value system, and it works perfectly. No Peta Volume restrictions so I can use all the Synology packages and keep my SSD cache, plus no need to for 64GB of RAM etc. Also, no need to comply with Synology's RAID6 restriction. I use SHR (which is not available with Peta Volumes) and also just SHR1 - so only one drive fault tolerance on a 18 bay 252TB array.\n\nI know - I can hear the screams now - but I've been doing this for 45 years since I was going into the computer room with each of my arms through the centres of around 8 x 16\" tape reels. I have a really deep knowledge of applying risk levels and storage, so please spare me the knee-jerk lectures. As someone probably won't be able to resist telling me I'm going to hell and back for daring to use RAID5/SHR1 -  these are just home media systems, so not critical at all in terms of availability and I use multiple levels of replication rather than traditional backups. Hence crashing one of more of my RAID volumes is a trivial issue and easily recovered from with zero downtime.\n\nFor those u/wallacebrf not reading the data correctly (mistaking volume used 112.5TB. for total volume size 215.44TB) here is a simpler view.   The volume group (vgs) is the pool size of 216.3TB and the volume (LVS) is also 216.30TB.   Of course you lose around 0.86TB for metadata - nearly all inodes in this case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Volume Group \\(pool\\) versus Volume](https://preview.redd.it/dhffp6c5oa1b1.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1b5518495b53873afc4834d8cb4cf53c6d030426)\n\nTo extend the logical volume just use the standard Linux lvextend command e.g. for my ext4 set-up it's the following to extend the volume to 250TB:\n\nlvextend\u00a0-L\u00a0256000G\u00a0/dev/vg1/volume\\_1\n\nand then extend the file system with:\n\nresize2fs /dev/mapper/cachedev\\_0\n\nSo the commands are very simple and just take a few seconds to type.   No files to edit with vi which can get overwritten during updates.  Just a single one-off command and the change will persist.  Extending the logical volume is quite quick, but extending the file system takes a bit longer to process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n1. **I would very strongly recommend extensively testing this first in a full copy of your system with the exact same use case as your live NAS.  Do not try this first on your production system.**\n2. I'd suggest 4GB RAM for up to 250TB volumes.  I'm not sure why Synology want 32GB for &gt;108Tib and 64GB for &gt;200TiB.   Linux does a great job of juggling all the caches and other ram uses.  So it's very unlikely that you'll run out of RAM.  Of course if you are using VMs or docker you need to adjust your ram calculation. Same goes for any other RAM hungry apps.   And obviously more ram is always better.\n3. I haven't tested &gt;256TB ext4 volumes.  There may be other changes required for this.  So if you want to go &gt;256TB  you'll need to extra testing and research e.g. around META\\_BG etc.  Without the option META\\_BG, for safety concerns, all block group descriptors copies are kept in the first block group. Given the default 128MiB(2\\^27 bytes) block group size and 64-byte group descriptors, ext4 can have at most 2\\^27/64 = 2\\^21 block groups. This limits the entire filesystem size to 2\\^21 \u2217 2\\^27 = 2\\^48bytes or 256TiB.   Otherwise the volume limit for ext4 is 1EiB(Exibyte) or 1,048,576TiB.\n4. Btrfs volumes are probably easier to go &gt;256TB, but again I haven't tested this as my largest pool is only 252TB raw.   The btrfs volume limit is 16EiB.\n5. You should have at least one full backup of your system.\n6. As with any major disk operation, you should probably run a full scrub first.\n7. I'd recommend not running this unless you know exactly what each command does and have an intimate knowledge of your volume groups, physical &amp; logical volumes and partitions via the cli.  If you extend the wrong volume, things will get messy.\n8. This is completely unsupported, so don't contact Synology support if you make mistakes.  Just restore from backup and either give-up or retry.\n9. Creating the initial volume - I'd suggest that you let DSM create the initial volume (after you have optionally tuned the inode\\_ratio).   As you going &gt;108TB, just let DSM initially create the volume with the default max size of 110,592GB.   Wait until DSM has done it's stuff and the volume is Healthy with no outstanding tasks running, you can then manually extend volume as shown above.\n10. When you test this in your test system, you can use the command  \"slabtop -s c\" or variations to monitor the kernel caches in real time.  You should do this under multiple tests with varying heavy workloads e.g. backups, snapshots, indexing the entire volume etc.   If you are not familiar with kernel caches then please google it as it's a bit too much to detail here.   You should at least be monitoring the caches for inodes and dentries and also checking that other uses of RAM are being correctly prioritised.  Monitor any swapfile usage. Make notes of how quickly the kernel is reclaiming memory from these caches.\n11. You can tune the tendancy of the kernel to reclaim memory by changing the value of vfs\\_cache\\_pressure.   I would not recommend this and I have only performed limited testing on it.  The default value gave optimal perormance for my workloads.   If you have very different workloads to me, then you may benefit from tuning this.  The default value is 100 - which represents a \"fair\" rate of dentries and inodes reclaiming in respect of pagecache and swapcache reclaim.    When vfs\\_cache\\_pressure=0, the kernel will never reclaim dentries and inodes due to memory pressure and this can easily lead to out-of-memory conditions i.e. a crash.   Increasing it too much will impact performance - e.g. the kernel will be taking out more locks to find freeable objects than are really needed.\n12. Synology use the standard ext4 inode\\_ratios - pretty much one-size-fits-all from a 1-bay nas up to a 36-bay.    With small 2 or  4 bay NASes with small 3 or 4TB HDDs, the total overhead isn't very much in absolute terms.   But for 50X larger volumes the absolute overhead is pretty large.   Worst case is if you first created a volume less than 16TiB, the ratio will be 16K.   If you then grow the volume to something much bigger, you'll end up with a massive amount of inodes and wasted disk space.   But most users considering &gt;108TiB volumes will probably have the large\\_volume ratio of 64K.   In practical terms this means for a 123.5TiB volume there would be around 2.1 billion inodes using up 494GiB of volume space.   Most users will likely only have a few million files of folders so  most of the 2 billion inodes will never be used.   As well as wasting disk space they add extra overhead.   So ideally if you are planning very large volumes you should tune the inode\\_ratio before starting.   For the above example of 123.5TiB volume I manually changed the ratio from 64K to 8,192K.   This gives me 16 million inodes which is more than I'll ever need on that system and only takes up 3.9GB of metadata overhead on the volume, rather than 494GB using the default ratio.  Also a bit less overhead to slow the system down.\n13. You can tune the inode\\_ratio by editing mke2fs.conf in etc.defaults.   Do this after the tiny system volumes have been created, but before you create your main user volumes.  Do not change the ratio for the system volumes otherwise you will kill your system.   You need to have very good understanding of the maximum number of files and folders that you will ever need and leave plenty of margin - I'd suggest 10x.  If you have too few inodes, you will eventually not be able to create or save files, even if you have plenty of free space.  Undo your edits after you've created the volume.   The command \"df -i\" tells you inode stats.\n14. You can use the command  \"tune2fs -l /dev/mapper/cachedev\\_0\" or equivalent for your volume name to get block and inode counts.   The block size is standard  at 4096.   So you simply calculate the number of bytes used in the blocks and divide it by the inode count to get your current inode\\_ratio.    It will be 16K for the system volumes and most likely 64K for your main volume.   Once you now how many files and folders you'll ever store in this volume, add a safety margin of say x10 to get your ideal number of inodes.   Then just reverse the previous formula to get your ideal inode\\_ratio.  Enjoy the decreased metadata overhead!\n15. Fotunately btrfs creates inodes on the fly when needed.  Hence although btrfs does use a lot more disk space for metadata at least it isn't wasting it on never to be used inodes.  So no need to worry about inode\\_ratios etc with btrfs.\n16. Command examples are for my set-up.   Change as appropriate for your volume names etc.\n17. You can check your LVM partition name and details using the \"df -h\" command.\n18. Btrfs is very similar except use  \"btrfs filesystem resize max /dev/mapper/cachedev\\_0\"  to resize the filesystem.\n19. You obviously need to have enough free space in your volume group (pool).   Check this with the \"vgs\" command.\n20. You can unmount the volume first if you want, but you don't need to with ext4.  I don't use btrfs - so research yourself if you need to unmount these volumes.\n21. Make sure your volume is clean with no errors before you extend it.   Check this with - \"tune2fs -l /dev/mapper/cachedev\\_0\"     Look for the value of \"Filesystem state:\" - it should say \"Clean\".\n22. If the volume is not clean run e2fsck first to ensure consistency:   \"e2fsck -fn /dev/mapper/cachedev\\_0\"   You'll probably get false errors unless you unmount the volume first.\n23. There are few posts with requests for Synology to add a \"volume shrink function\" within DSM.  You can use the same logic and commands to manually shrink the volumes.  But there are a few areas were you could screw up your volume and lose your data.  Hence carry out your own research before doing this.\n24. Variations of the lvextend command usage:   Use all free space:   \"lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg1/volume\\_ 1\"  Extend by an extra 50TB:  \"lvextend -L +51200G /dev/vg1/volume\\_1\" Extend volume to 250TB:  \"lvextend\u00a0-L\u00a0256000G\u00a0/dev/vg1/volume\\_1\"\n\nThe commands \"vgs\", \"pvs\", \"lvs\" and \"df-h\" give you the details of your volume group, physical volumes, logical volumes and partitions respectively as per example  below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xixckxpdd1b1.png?width=1109&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ca14c6d127dc20984c64da0c2bad6bb29a75d66\n\nAfter the expansion the DSM GUI still works fine.  Obviously there is just one oddity as per below.  In the settings on your volume the current size (216.3TiB in my case) will now be greater than the maximum allowed of 110592GiB (108TiB).  This doesn't matter as you won't be using this anymore.  Any future expansions will be done using lvextend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fav55wx0ed1b1.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1ca3d10f374e5ab3af899da085f7169d5e8b1aca", "author_fullname":

7.2, so I thought it\u2019s time to post about my testing on &amp;gt;200TB volumes on low end Synologys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of posts here and elsewhere of folks going to great expense and effort to create volumes larger than 108TB or 200TB on their Synology NAS. The 108TB limit was created by Synology nearly 10 years ago when their new DS1815+ was launched at the time when 6TB was the largest HDD - 18 bays x 6 = 108TB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now those same 18 bays could have a pool of 18 x 26TB = 468TB, but still the old limits haven&amp;#39;t shifted unless you live in the Enterprise space or are very wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many posts here go into very fine (and expensive) detail of just which few Synology NAS can handle 200TB volumes - typically expensive XS or RS models with at least 32GB RAM and the holy grail of the very few models that can handle Peta Volumes (&amp;gt;200TB) which need a min of 64GB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the very top end models that can handle Peta Volumes are very handicapped - no SHR which is bad for a typical home user and no SSD cache - bad for business especially - plus many more limitations - e.g., you have to use RAID6, no Shared Folder Sync etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But very few questions here about why these limits exist. There is no Btrfs or ext4 valid reason for the limits. Nor in most cases (except for the real 16GB limit with 32bit CPUs) are there valid CPU or hardware architecture reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been testing &amp;gt;200TB volumes on low end consumer Synology NAS since last December on a low value / risk system (I&amp;#39;ve since gone live on all my Synology systems). So, a few months ago I asked Synology what the cause was of these limits. Here is their final response:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have spoken with our HQ and unfortunately they are not able to provide any further information to me other than it is a hardware limitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The limitations that they have referred to are based 32bit/64bit, mapping tables between RAM and filesystems and lastly, CPU architecture. They have also informed me that other Linux variations also have similar limitations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Analysing this statement - we can strip away the multiple reference to 32/64 bit and CPU architecture which we all know about.   That is a 32bit CPU really is restricted to a 16TB volume, but that barely applies to most modern Synology NAS which are all 64bit.   That leaves just one item left in their statement - mapping tables between RAM and filesystems.  That&amp;#39;s basically inodes and the inodes cache.    The inode cache contains copies of inodes for open files and for some recently used files that are no longer open. Linux is great at squeezing all sorts of caches into available RAM.   If other more important tasks need RAM, then Linux will just forget some of the less recently accessed file inodes.  So this is self-managing and certainly not a hardware limit as Synology support states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Synology states that this is  &amp;quot;a hardware limitation&amp;quot;.    This is patently not true as demonstrated below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is my 10-year-old DS1813+ with just 4GB RAM (the whole thing cost me about \u00a3350 used) with 144TB pool all in one SHR1 volume of 123.5TiB. No need for 32GB of RAM or buying an RS or XS NAS. No issues, no running out of RAM (Linux does a great job of managing caches and inodes etc - so the Synology reason about mapping tables is very wrong).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0vyk4otqfa1b1.png?width=1879&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=fc6457ff7741f0386730be6e992a66bb13a5eb7a\"&gt;10 year-old DS1813+ with just 4GB of RAM and &amp;gt; 108TB volume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the holy grail - Peta Volumes. Here is one of my DS1817+ with 16GB RAM and a 252TB pool with a single SHR1 volume of 216.3TiB.   As you can see this NAS is now on DSM7.2 and everything is still working fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;![img](5zl22wtzfa1b1 &amp;quot;\nDS1817+ with 16GB RAM and &amp;gt; 200TB volume&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wlr8baiama1b1.png?width=1493&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=3ca5186716ce23238d25933f3f4cc27a9cf12a3c\"&gt;Some folks are mixing up Volume Used with Total Volume Size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not using Peta Volumes with all their extra software overhead and restrictions - just a boring standard Ext4 / LVM2 volume. I&amp;#39;ve completed 6 months of testing on a low risk / value system, and it works perfectly. No Peta Volume restrictions so I can use all the Synology packages and keep my SSD cache, plus no need to for 64GB of RAM etc. Also, no need to comply with Synology&amp;#39;s RAID6 restriction. I use SHR (which is not available with Peta Volumes) and also just SHR1 - so only one drive fault tolerance on a 18 bay 252TB array.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know - I can hear the screams now - but I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for 45 years since I was going into the computer room with each of my arms through the centres of around 8 x 16&amp;quot; tape reels. I have a really deep knowledge of applying risk levels and storage, so please spare me the knee-jerk lectures. As someone probably won&amp;#39;t be able to resist telling me I&amp;#39;m going to hell and back for daring to use RAID5/SHR1 -  these are just home media systems, so not critical at all in terms of availability and I use multiple levels of replication rather than traditional backups. Hence crashing one of more of my RAID volumes is a trivial issue and easily recovered from with zero downtime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those &lt;a href=\"/u/wallacebrf\"&gt;u/wallacebrf&lt;/a&gt; not reading the data correctly (mistaking volume used 112.5TB. for total volume size 215.44TB) here is a simpler view.   The volume group (vgs) is the pool size of 216.3TB and the volume (LVS) is also 216.30TB.   Of course you lose around 0.86TB for metadata - nearly all inodes in this case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dhffp6c5oa1b1.png?width=978&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=1b5518495b53873afc4834d8cb4cf53c6d030426\"&gt;Volume Group (pool) versus Volume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To extend the logical volume just use the standard Linux lvextend command e.g. for my ext4 set-up it&amp;#39;s the following to extend the volume to 250TB:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;lvextend\u00a0-L\u00a0256000G\u00a0/dev/vg1/volume_1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and then extend the file system with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;resize2fs /dev/mapper/cachedev_0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the commands are very simple and just take a few seconds to type.   No files to edit with vi which can get overwritten during updates.  Just a single one-off command and the change will persist.  Extending the logical volume is quite quick, but extending the file system takes a bit longer to process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would very strongly recommend extensively testing this first in a full copy of your system with the exact same use case as your live NAS.  Do not try this first on your production system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;d suggest 4GB RAM for up to 250TB volumes.  I&amp;#39;m not sure why Synology want 32GB for &amp;gt;108Tib and 64GB for &amp;gt;200TiB.   Linux does a great job of juggling all the caches and other ram uses.  So it&amp;#39;s very unlikely that you&amp;#39;ll run out of RAM.  Of course if you are using VMs or docker you need to adjust your ram calculation. Same goes for any other RAM hungry apps.   And obviously more ram is always better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t tested &amp;gt;256TB ext4 volumes.  There may be other changes required for this.  So if you want to go &amp;gt;256TB  you&amp;#39;ll need to extra testing and research e.g. around META_BG etc.  Without the option META_BG, for safety concerns, all block group descriptors copies are kept in the first block group. Given the default 128MiB(2^27 bytes) block group size and 64-byte group descriptors, ext4 can have at most 2^27/64 = 2^21 block groups. This limits the entire filesystem size to 2^21 \u2217 2^27 = 2^48bytes or 256TiB.   Otherwise the volume limit for ext4 is 1EiB(Exibyte) or 1,048,576TiB.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Btrfs volumes are probably easier to go &amp;gt;256TB, but again I haven&amp;#39;t tested this as my largest pool is only 252TB raw.   The btrfs volume limit is 16EiB.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You should have at least one full backup of your system.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As with any major disk operation, you should probably run a full scrub first.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend not running this unless you know exactly what each command does and have an intimate knowledge of your volume groups, physical &amp;amp; logical volumes and partitions via the cli.  If you extend the wrong volume, things will get messy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is completely unsupported, so don&amp;#39;t contact Synology support if you make mistakes.  Just restore from backup and either give-up or retry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creating the initial volume - I&amp;#39;d suggest that you let DSM create the initial volume (after you have optionally tuned the inode_ratio).   As you going &amp;gt;108TB, just let DSM initially create the volume with the default max size of 110,592GB.   Wait until DSM has done it&amp;#39;s stuff and the volume is Healthy with no outstanding tasks running, you can then manually extend volume as shown above.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When you test this in your test system, you can use the command  &amp;quot;slabtop -s c&amp;quot; or variations to monitor the kernel caches in real time.  You should do this under multiple tests with varying heavy workloads e.g. backups, snapshots, indexing the entire volume etc.   If you are not familiar with kernel caches then please google it as it&amp;#39;s a bit too much to detail here.   You should at least be monitoring the caches for inodes and dentries and also checking that other uses of RAM are being correctly prioritised.  Monitor any swapfile usage. Make notes of how quickly the kernel is reclaiming memory from these caches.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can tune the tendancy of the kernel to reclaim memory by changing the value of vfs_cache_pressure.   I would not recommend this and I have only performed limited testing on it.  The default value gave optimal perormance for my workloads.   If you have very different workloads to me, then you may benefit from tuning this.  The default value is 100 - which represents a &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; rate of dentries and inodes reclaiming in respect of pagecache and swapcache reclaim.    When vfs_cache_pressure=0, the kernel will never reclaim dentries and inodes due to memory pressure and this can easily lead to out-of-memory conditions i.e. a crash.   Increasing it too much will impact performance - e.g. the kernel will be taking out more locks to find freeable objects than are really needed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Synology use the standard ext4 inode_ratios - pretty much one-size-fits-all from a 1-bay nas up to a 36-bay.    With small 2 or  4 bay NASes with small 3 or 4TB HDDs, the total overhead isn&amp;#39;t very much in absolute terms.   But for 50X larger volumes the absolute overhead is pretty large.   Worst case is if you first created a volume less than 16TiB, the ratio will be 16K.   If you then grow the volume to something much bigger, you&amp;#39;ll end up with a massive amount of inodes and wasted disk space.   But most users considering &amp;gt;108TiB volumes will probably have the large_volume ratio of 64K.   In practical terms this means for a 123.5TiB volume there would be around 2.1 billion inodes using up 494GiB of volume space.   Most users will likely only have a few million files of folders so  most of the 2 billion inodes will never be used.   As well as wasting disk space they add extra overhead.   So ideally if you are planning very large volumes you should tune the inode_ratio before starting.   For the above example of 123.5TiB volume I manually changed the ratio from 64K to 8,192K.   This gives me 16 million inodes which is more than I&amp;#39;ll ever need on that system and only takes up 3.9GB of metadata overhead on the volume, rather than 494GB using the default ratio.  Also a bit less overhead to slow the system down.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can tune the inode_ratio by editing mke2fs.conf in etc.defaults.   Do this after the tiny system volumes have been created, but before you create your main user volumes.  Do not change the ratio for the system volumes otherwise you will kill your system.   You need to have very good understanding of the maximum number of files and folders that you will ever need and leave plenty of margin - I&amp;#39;d suggest 10x.  If you have too few inodes, you will eventually not be able to create or save files, even if you have plenty of free space.  Undo your edits after you&amp;#39;ve created the volume.   The command &amp;quot;df -i&amp;quot; tells you inode stats.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can use the command  &amp;quot;tune2fs -l /dev/mapper/cachedev_0&amp;quot; or equivalent for your volume name to get block and inode counts.   The block size is standard  at 4096.   So you simply calculate the number of bytes used in the blocks and divide it by the inode count to get your current inode_ratio.    It will be 16K for the system volumes and most likely 64K for your main volume.   Once you now how many files and folders you&amp;#39;ll ever store in this volume, add a safety margin of say x10 to get your ideal number of inodes.   Then just reverse the previous formula to get your ideal inode_ratio.  Enjoy the decreased metadata overhead!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fotunately btrfs creates inodes on the fly when needed.  Hence although btrfs does use a lot more disk space for metadata at least it isn&amp;#39;t wasting it on never to be used inodes.  So no need to worry about inode_ratios etc with btrfs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Command examples are for my set-up.   Change as appropriate for your volume names etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can check your LVM partition name and details using the &amp;quot;df -h&amp;quot; command.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Btrfs is very similar except use  &amp;quot;btrfs filesystem resize max /dev/mapper/cachedev_0&amp;quot;  to resize the filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You obviously need to have enough free space in your volume group (pool).   Check this with the &amp;quot;vgs&amp;quot; command.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can unmount the volume first if you want, but you don&amp;#39;t need to with ext4.  I don&amp;#39;t use btrfs - so research yourself if you need to unmount these volumes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure your volume is clean with no errors before you extend it.   Check this with - &amp;quot;tune2fs -l /dev/mapper/cachedev_0&amp;quot;     Look for the value of &amp;quot;Filesystem state:&amp;quot; - it should say &amp;quot;Clean&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If the volume is not clean run e2fsck first to ensure consistency:   &amp;quot;e2fsck -fn /dev/mapper/cachedev_0&amp;quot;   You&amp;#39;ll probably get false errors unless you unmount the volume first.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are few posts with requests for Synology to add a &amp;quot;volume shrink function&amp;quot; within DSM.  You can use the same logic and commands to manually shrink the volumes.  But there are a few areas were you could screw up your volume and lose your data.  Hence carry out your own research before doing this.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Variations of the lvextend command usage:   Use all free space:   &amp;quot;lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg1/volume_ 1&amp;quot;  Extend by an extra 50TB:  &amp;quot;lvextend -L +51200G /dev/vg1/volume_1&amp;quot; Extend volume to 250TB:  &amp;quot;lvextend\u00a0-L\u00a0256000G\u00a0/dev/vg1/volume_1&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The commands &amp;quot;vgs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pvs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lvs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;df-h&amp;quot; give you the details of your volume group, physical volumes, logical volumes and partitions respectively as per example  below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1xixckxpdd1b1.png?width=1109&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=6ca14c6d127dc20984c64da0c2bad6bb29a75d66\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/1xixckxpdd1b1.png?width=1109&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=6ca14c6d127dc20984c64da0c2bad6bb29a75d66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the expansion the DSM GUI still works fine.

I previously had 4 x 500GB 2.5\" HDD's in my system. I finally started needing more space, so I purchased 4 x 2TB 2.5\" HDD's (seagate) to replace the 4 x 500GB hard drives.\n\nI get a sustained transfer speed of about 125MB/s with the 2TB 2.5\" hard drives to my server. This is about the max speed the 2TB hard drives can do of course.\n\nAnyways, I want to replace those 2TB 2.5\" hard drives with 2TB SSD's as prices are nice right now. \n\nI really don't want to purchase a Samsung or Crucial, as those brands are still expensive. My budget fits perfectly with the cheaper SSD models, like Teamgroup, Fiaxang, Addlink, Lexar, etc.\n\nThe thing is, the cheaper 2TB SSD's are great pricewise, but I have found on testing some of the cheaper models on long transfers (which I do a lot of) that I get a burst of speed (due to the small SLC cache) of \\~350-450MB/s or so for a few seconds, but then after the SLC cache is full, the speeds drop to about 75-80MB/s for the remainder of the transfer.\n\n*My 2TB hard drives however, do a sustained 125MB/s transfer/write speed from start to end.*\n\n**I find that the transfer finishes faster coming from my 2TB hard drives than coming from a cheap 2TB SSD.** My thing is, is it worth it to get one of these cheap 2TB SSD's for better seek and random times? The price on a 2TB HDD is about $45 new. A new 2TB SSD is about $65.\n\nSo for long transfers, my 2TB hard drives work out to be cheaper ***and*** faster!\n\nYes I know, more expensive brand SSD's will have better sustained speeds and larger cache, but they cost twice as much as the cheaper brands SSD's, so those don't fit in my budget for now.\n\n**So TLDR:** Should I just stop purchasing hard drives and move to SSD's even though the speed will be a net less overall? I know the SSD would be better for random access and seek times though.\n\nOr, do I stick with the 2TB 2.5\" hard drives?

I previously had 4 x 500GB 2.5&amp;quot; HDD&amp;#39;s in my system. I finally started needing more space, so I purchased 4 x 2TB 2.5&amp;quot; HDD&amp;#39;s (seagate) to replace the 4 x 500GB hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get a sustained transfer speed of about 125MB/s with the 2TB 2.5&amp;quot; hard drives to my server. This is about the max speed the 2TB hard drives can do of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I want to replace those 2TB 2.5&amp;quot; hard drives with 2TB SSD&amp;#39;s as prices are nice right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t want to purchase a Samsung or Crucial, as those brands are still expensive. My budget fits perfectly with the cheaper SSD models, like Teamgroup, Fiaxang, Addlink, Lexar, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the cheaper 2TB SSD&amp;#39;s are great pricewise, but I have found on testing some of the cheaper models on long transfers (which I do a lot of) that I get a burst of speed (due to the small SLC cache) of ~350-450MB/s or so for a few seconds, but then after the SLC cache is full, the speeds drop to about 75-80MB/s for the remainder of the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My 2TB hard drives however, do a sustained 125MB/s transfer/write speed from start to end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I find that the transfer finishes faster coming from my 2TB hard drives than coming from a cheap 2TB SSD.&lt;/strong&gt; My thing is, is it worth it to get one of these cheap 2TB SSD&amp;#39;s for better seek and random times? The price on a 2TB HDD is about $45 new. A new 2TB SSD is about $65.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for long transfers, my 2TB hard drives work out to be cheaper &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; faster!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes I know, more expensive brand SSD&amp;#39;s will have better sustained speeds and larger cache, but they cost twice as much as the cheaper brands SSD&amp;#39;s, so those don&amp;#39;t fit in my budget for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; Should I just stop purchasing hard drives and move to SSD&amp;#39;s even though the speed will be a net less overall? I know the SSD would be better for random access and seek times though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, do I stick with the 2TB 2.5&amp;quot; hard drives?
