The first group I joined was with a subsidiary division of the parent company which had just been recently acquired via buyout, and while the people I worked with were wonderful and will remember for the rest of my life, their infrastructure was woefully unprepared for the kind of reporting and analytical demands placed upon them by the parent company. Their single source of truth was an Oracle database that could only be queried (despite my repeated inquests towards direct backend access) through Oracle's awful, *awful* low-code drag-and-drop Scratch-reminiscent BI interface, which stored queries as XML and had no readily available way of doing more complex row-based calculations that were often needed for our analyses. Worsening the matter, there were simply **no connectors for automated data exfiltration**, meaning **every single resultset** that needed to be used outside the database (I.E. all of them) had to be manually downloaded as an Excel file (thus immediately violating all data integrity) and loaded into your analysis toolkit of choice, which, until I joined, was Excel. \n\nMy next several months were spent devising diabolical devices within Microsoft's awful spreadsheet software, ranging from fixing a very poorly-written lift-testing tool to replacing the very same tool with a custom-written regression testing suite (again, in Excel) to hopefully impart some statistical reliability into the otherwise largely unstructured and *ahem* bespoke analyses undertaken before. Our weekly reporting wasn't automated, and every report we made each team member was assigned a block of product categories to retrieve data for, hunt through for \"interesting statistics\", and manually write up bullet points about - all to be sent in an email to mid-level management, of which I'm sure was absolutely never read in any serious capacity.\n\nEventually I was stolen away by another team, and the problems only compounded from there. From this point onwards I was working directly with the parent company's database, which thankfully was in Snowflake and allowed me to query it directly from R, which made me very happy. Despite these advances in accessibility, the data within the myriad undocumented schemas and tables proved to be even worse to deal with than the clunky, albeit relatively clean, Oracle platform. We had several different sets of poorly named and confusing customer IDs across the entire database, with each customer having several different data profiles that would often outright conflict with one another, and no guidance on which to take as truth - we even imported third party demographic data from a certain credit reporting bureau that continually had discrepancies with our first-party data, and no effort was taken to reconcile our own records against this very expensive source that we were paying dearly for. Customer order data was a mess, with item data being stored inconsistently - sometimes breaking off modifiers into their own item, sometimes not, sometimes breaking out packs into individual items, often not, and many, many other egregious design decisions. Our gift cards were handled by a third party, who due to byzantine bureaucracy refused to provide us with a data share or API, forcing one poor soul on my team to use Selenium to automatically download CSVs from their database and load it into a team table. Retention was horrible, and over the course of the year I was with this team, we went through at least 4 managers - some lost via HR action, others leaving for greener pastures from what was obviously a failing system.\n\nThings weren't all bad. The front-line people there I met were all great people, many of which I still voluntarily talk to to this day and call friends, and the company knew how to throw a party - the bartenders at the quarterly office meetings poured *very* heavily. Accomodations were nice, parking plentiful, and everybody down to the front desk receptionist got an Aeron chair, which I sorely miss to this day. However, the experience taught me several painful lessons that inevitably led to my departure:\n\n * Garbage in, garbage out.  \n * Change is asked for from the bottom, but vetoed by the top. Even if you have floors full of very, very smart analysts begging for it (we did, roughly three) and a whole lot of money to do it, ($1B+ in profit for 2021) if your boss's boss doesn't want something to happen, it won't happen. Job satisfaction is determined strongly by whether those in the position to make a change listen to those asking for a change.  \n * Do it right the first time or forever regret it.  \n * Data quality doesn't mean shit if your table and db schemas are incomprehensible.  \n * Communication is important, and a lot of pain could have been alleviated if we had just had open channels with the data engineering team. \n * Don't be surprised when the analyst you're paying like an analyst and expecting to do engineer work leaves to get paid like an engineer.  \n\nI have since found a much better job with management that (mostly) listens, but the moral of the story is this - if you're stuck in a shitty job, you want change, and management doesn't, it's almost always better to simply pack up and find somewhere that respects you than to hit your head against a rock and hope it moves.

to all this LLM's I've been trying to understand what \"generalization\" means.And I think it is one of the less defined concepts across all sciences, and sometimes they are even at odds with each other.\n\nOne example is how statistics treats generalization as this principle that is true for a great portion of the subset it analyses but not all, WHILE the linguistic definition of generalization says that IF the statement is NOT TRUE for even one of the items, then it cannot be considered a generalization.\n\nSo, in statistics what gives the quality of generalization is SPECIFICALLY not encompassing the totality of the group, while in linguistics is the opposite.\n\nWhat I see, is that Cognitive sciences and ML research is tending towards the linguistic definition, since the \"Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine\" explicitly alludes to these \"building blocks\" that help in the generalization of tasks.\n\nThe idea in TEM is that: the better the generalization is at grouping truth statements, the best the extrapolation will be.\n\nAnd now we give a new dimension to the concept of generalization... \"good and bad\" generalizations... but what is the limit?
