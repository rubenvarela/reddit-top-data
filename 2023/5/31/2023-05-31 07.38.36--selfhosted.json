It can be installed on top of a existing compatible OS like Ubuntu or Debian, or can be run as standalone. Its basically a neat webinterface to control some apps that (i think) are handled in the background with docker. It is very similar to [CasaOS](https://www.casaos.io/), [Tipi](https://www.runtipi.io/) and in parts similar to [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/).\n\n#So Umbrel has just announced their own hardware, a homeserver called \"Umbrel Home\".\n\n[Link to the announcement on their page](https://community.getumbrel.com/t/introducing-umbrel-home-the-ultimate-home-server-for-self-hosting/12588). [Youtube trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIcddM6YFug).\n\nNice Apple-ish product video, but not a lot of hardware details mentioned... and then the price, a whopping 668\u20ac (that would be in Germany including taxes, i dont know the USD price sorry).\n\nAnd the **Umbrel Co-Founder** shared these exciting news with us here on the subreddit, in [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13vqgr2/umbrel_home_a_powerful_compact_home_server/) that now isnt visible anymore when browsing the sub. \nAfter [i mentioned some \\(i believe fair and detailed\\) critique](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13vqgr2/umbrel_home_a_powerful_compact_home_server/jm79qfr/) based on the hardware and the asking price... the Co-Founder reacts by **deleting their entire Reddit account**. What?! Honestly thats not the reaction i want to see from a company that receives **a single comment** on their product and asking more than twice the price of the basic hardware. But thats for everyone else to judge.\n\nAs i mentioned in my original comment, i will simply try to recommend more [CasaOS](https://www.casaos.io/) and [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/) in the furure ;) But i already did since imo Umbrel lacks a few features that Casa of example has, for example last time i tried it (~2 months ago) i couldnt add my own apps to it, like with a docker run or docker-compose.yml. I was stuck with the apps that they have in their \"app store\". And a lot of those are crypto related, which i simply do not care for. CasaOS i was able to add my own things into it. Yuno (i think) doesnt use Docker in the background for the apps and i didnt try it enough to know more details.\n\nRight now im trying out [Tipi](https://www.runtipi.io/) as i have only heard about this once or twice here but never took a real look at it.\n\n**But this thread shouldnt be another drama-thread, we all hate those. There is no need to shit on these developers. I can only imagine that this guy was stressed out because of this launch and simply reacted badly to feedback. Not a good reaction at all, but we are all human. Some of us.**\n\nI believe it still deservers its place here given that the product is aimed exactly at the selfhosting community, and it comes with Umbrel as the OS which kinda makes it fitting here for selfhosting software services.\n\n**So what are anyone elses thoughts on this product?**\n\nAm i missing maybe something very obvious that justifies the price? Someone in the original thread mentioned software being included. But Umbrel the \"OS\" is already free and \"opensource\". Of course devs should and need to get paid for their efforts, but putting existing software on top of 300\u20ac hardware, even stripping out some hardware parts, and then asking more than twice the price at 668\u20ac for it... thats a bit extreme i think.\n\n#Update:\n\nOkay a small update to this. First, it looks like /u/lukechilds123 is another member of the Umbrel team and they have posted [this thread here](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13vtcei/umbrel_home_a_powerful_compact_home_server/) on the sub. I can see in their post history that they left comments trying to get my attention about the other post being removed, but for some reason i never received those mentions, and i cant even load their comments, its only visible in the history. Very weird again but whatever, here is what they tried to pass along:\n\n&gt; Mayank is my cofounder, he didn't delete his account, we're not quite sure what happened but it looks like potentially his account got deleted by mods after posting all the announcement posts. He asked me to forward this to you from him here:\n\nMods deleted their account? *cough* /u/kmisterk are you a reddit admin now? :D\n\nOf course there is such a thing as automatic spam protection on reddit, and people can get banned (not deleted) for that. I believe it is possible that their comment got automatically removed, but considering the amount of spam we see here in the sub every day, from fresh accounts with no karma (FRANK`s) and they dont get auto-deleted by reddit, they last for weeks or months. And i believe its very unlikely that somehow reddit deleted their account for this, if at all, reddit bans accounts for spam and such. Deleted account, imo, is done by the user themself and nobody else. And i think we can all agree that no moderator, not even kmisterk here, can delete accounts. So whatever, it smells fishy but who cares. **drama &gt; /dev/null**\n\n**Idgaf now what spamfilter deleted it or not. I am curious why this thing has this insane price.**\n\nOut of fairness to the Umbrel team, i want to take the chance here in the OP to point out that the /u/getumbrel account has also replied here now, apparently used by the same co-founder that \"got deleted\". [Here is the link to their comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13vsk91/umbrel_has_just_announced_their_own_hardware/jm8dl16/). Otherwise it might get drowned here.\n\nA important piece from there is:\n\n&gt; To address the feedback on price, we hear you, and do want to point out that the form factor of Umbrel Home is way smaller than a regular NUC with similar specs. With a smaller form factor, we also had to use a 2242 SSD, which are priced considerably higher, especially in 2TB configuration vs. a 2280 drive. The materials and finish are also higher quality than most NUCs out there, and we\u2019ve put a significant effort into the product design.\n\nSo their product is \"way\" smaller than a typical NUC. Great! But how much smaller? They dont seem to mention exact dimensions anywhere. And i am surprised that only a 2242 drive did fit in there, when its just little bit shorther than a typical 2280. And they have plenty of room inside because they have any WLAN/BT module and not its 2232 slot, less USB ports, no HDMI/DP ports. Basically a lot less inside than the comparable NUC would have, so making it smaller (if thats a must) shouldnt be too much of a problem without needing to use a much more expensive (and low on stock) 2242 drive. This just seems odd to me.\n\nAnd the materials and finish are of higher quality? Cool, we all love quality! But what materials are they? Again, no details.\n\n**So i guess we have to accept that the reason this thing costs twice as much as a same performance NUC, it that its maybe a bit smaller and maybe the top of it is made of aluminium?**", "author_fullname": "t2_jldsn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Umbrel has just announced their own hardware: Umbrel Home...", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "productannouncement", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_13vsk91", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Product Announcement", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1685475904.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1685458679.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For background: If you didnt know, &lt;a href=\"https://umbrel.com/\"&gt;Umbrel&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively popular software for selfhosting, mostly aimed at beginners or casuals i would say.

be able to access my wyze cameras' WebRTC streams via reverse proxy.  To make sure everything was working, I left the proxy out of the equation and just exposed the default ports on the host via the docker config.  With that setup, I can successfully access the WebRTC stream by going to `http://myhost:8889/camera-name`\n\nNow I'd like to secure that behind my reverse proxy.

If this is completely the wrong tool for the job I might just try Wireguard instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e5c2d58-7e68-11e9-9418-0e844b9a0afc", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "13vssbc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PSyCHoHaMSTeRza", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/13vssbc/can_zero_trust_help_with_peering_issues/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13vssbc/can_zero_trust_help_with_peering_issues/", "subreddit_subscribers": 251341, "created_utc": 1685459177.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nLast week I set up a media server on an old laptop running Debian 11 and everything runs great.
