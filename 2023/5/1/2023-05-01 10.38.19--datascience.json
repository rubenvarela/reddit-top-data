{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": "t3_1344l4h", "dist": 25, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Throughout my career, I have always occupied roles which closely resembled what people seem to be talking about when they talk about \u201cdata science\u201d. However, I was never formally trained in data science, or even machine learning, as a subject. As a result of my engineering degree, I had been taught mathematical modelling (i.e. how to translate problems from word-based descriptions into formal mathematical problems which can then be tackled analytically), as well as the concept of iterative development (i.e. how to start with a ridiculously simple solution to something and then add complexity to it progressively to make the solution better and better). I then did a master\u2019s in applied statistics, which taught me probability theory at a deeper level than I could\u2019ve ever imagined, and picked up the ability to code through successive jobs.\n\nI say all this because I am now at a level of seniority in my career where I now have to hire data scientists, i.e. hire the very person I used to be. And the experience has been\u2026 well\u2026 underwhelming would be to put it kindly. There are serious skill deficits among the data scientists I have interviewed, among those whom I converse with in sister companies, and sadly even among those who I have ended up hiring. (If you are wondering why I would hire someone whose skills aren\u2019t that great, please realise that: 1. It can take time for this deficit to become apparent, 2. The person can still be useful in terms of taking simpler and more annoying work off others, 3. What actually happens during a hiring process is that you are told by your superiors that \u201cwe need a data scientist\u201d and are allotted a budget for that specific role, and if you don\u2019t fill it you get yelled at).\n\nHere are the most serious problems I have observed among data scientists I have met and interacted with:\n\n1. Only ever reaching for their \u201cbag of tricks\u201d\n\nAs the old saying goes: if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Pretty much all the data scientists I have met in my time seem to have a mental catalogue of well-known algorithms (K-nearest neighbours, Bayesian networks, logistic regression, etc.), and refer to this catalogue of algorithms in the same way an alchemist from the Middle Ages would refer to a book of alchemical recipes. They\u2019re not quite sure which recipes will work or why, but they know some of them work some of the time. So they try to pattern-match the current situation to previous situations they\u2019ve encountered, and try to remember which recipe seemed to work then.\n\nThe idea of **not** doing this, of **not** reaching for one of their pre-cooked algorithmic ready meals, of stopping and examining the problem in detail from its foundations and maybe even coming up with their own method of solving it (yes, from scratch!), seems to fill them with the uttermost horror. And the idea that a problem might even have an **analytic** solution, if you just think about it a bit, is simply too much for many of them to bear (one who I currently work with calls such an approach \u201cpseudoscience\u201d).\n\nI suspect this propensity for crowbarring pre-memorized algorithms into unsuitable situations has two underlying causes: (a) A lack of practice at mathematical modelling (which is a different skill from data science), and (b) A lack of comfort with probability and statistics. I\u2019ve had data scientists stare at me, dumbfounded, when I tell them the correlation coefficient only measures straight-line relationships, and will be useless for nonlinear (e.g. U-shaped) relationships. I\u2019ve had a data scientist tell me with confidence that the correct way to calculate the probability of A and B happening is always, under all circumstances, to multiply the probability of A by the probability of B. When I pointed out that this obviously wasn\u2019t true if A and B were tightly correlated and that they might be missing something important (I was trying to see if they were aware of the concept of conditional probability), they had a kind of meltdown and started questioning whether all of probability theory was wrong.\n\nTo those who say, \u201cBut data scientists are trained to use the algorithms that they\u2019re taught, not the weird stuff you\u2019re talking about\u201d, I say I\u2019m afraid that just isn\u2019t good enough. Your job is to extract meaning from data. That is the task you are being hired for. If you are flummoxed by basic probability theory, or are uncomfortable coming up with your own algorithms, you are going to be eaten alive by those who are comfortable with both.\n\nFor example, I used to work for a debt collection company a few years back and our data was horrifically sporadic and noisy. The data science team up north used to just shake their heads and say there was little they could do as the data was such a mess. It didn\u2019t fit into the logistic regression algorithm they were obsessed with, and was therefore unusable. Once, we were on the verge of losing a client because we couldn\u2019t figure out a way to contact the people most likely to pay their debts. It was regarded as a foregone conclusion that we would lose this client. However, I was able to use a Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier (written in VBA and Excel because we weren\u2019t allowed Python in our southern branch for \"security reasons\") to assign log-likelihoods of payment to individuals based on about 10-12 features. The fact that these log-likelihoods were almost certainly \u201cinaccurate\u201d didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was that, using this rough metric of quality, you could rank the individuals in descending order of likelihood and just skim off the top few thousand. Then only these would be sent to our call centre, instead of them having to call hundreds of thousands of debtors at random because the edict from the data science team was that the data was unusable. Our debt collections on that client shot up by 270% after I did that. Needless to say, this reflected very well on me and very poorly on the data science team up north, and my bonus reflected this.\n\n2. Choosing complex solutions before checking if simple ones will do\n\nI get it. You spent hundreds of hours learning about random forests, XGBoost, neural networks, stochastic gradient descent, k-means clustering, simulated annealing, and god-knows-what else. You want to start using these algorithms somewhere, anywhere, to make all that time worthwhile. But have you stopped to consider that maybe the particular problem you\u2019re working on right now actually doesn\u2019t require\u2026 well\u2026 any of that?\n\nHow about, instead of spending a month or two trying to fit a neural network to a noisy dataset (including such joys as deciding how many layers it should have, how many nodes per layer, what the activation function should be, whether it should have dropout, etc) and then telling me that you didn\u2019t accomplish anything because the data is so bad, you instead tried drawing a **straight line** through the data instead? The former takes ages and is almost guaranteed to fail, the latter takes 10 minutes and is almost guaranteed to succeed. Fair enough, the fit isn\u2019t great, but it at least it gives you something to extrapolate from, and something to show to management / clients if deadlines suddenly shrink.\n\nAnd you know what else? While you were spending the 10 minutes coding that baby-level linear regression, your muscle memory probably started kicking in, and now you remember that, come to think of it, there\u2019s something called the [generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) which would let you fit the curve to some forms of non-linear data. Maybe the data happens to be of that form and you can adapt the code so that it can do that instead, thereby giving a better fit. Then, maybe after that, you remember that scipy literally has a [curve fit function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html), in which you can explicitly specify the curve family that you think the curve should be from, and then it just optimizes for the parameters. And so on. If you\u2019ve just made a beeline straight for the most complex thing you can think of, you\u2019re going to just fumble around aimlessly for ages and get nothing done.\n\nIn general, you should always start with the simplest, laziest solution to any problem. This is because: (a) It\u2019s fast, (b) It\u2019s easy, (c) It\u2019s low stress, (d) It gets you \u201cwarmed up\u201d to the problem, so that any future ideas for complex improvements will occur more easily to you, (e) It lets you break the problem into chunks, each of which is easier to solve than the whole, (f) It might be all that you\u2019re able to do anyway, given the quality of the data, and (g) While management / clients may throw around big important-sounding words like \u201coptimization\u201d, \u201cmachine learning\u201d, and \u201calgorithms\u201d, there is a precisely 0% chance that they mean these phrases in the same way you mean them. A \u201cprediction algorithm\u201d can be a straight line to them, and a sigmoid curve will blow their minds. Start simple, then add complexity if necessary.\n\n3. Snobbishness about Excel\n\nExcel is one of the most widely-used data science platforms in the world. I feel sorry for any readers who think it is beneath them, or who think it somehow isn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d data science platform. You are missing out on such an opportunity. You can write your algorithm out step-by-step in the cells for all the world to see, so they can pick apart the formulas and understand them. That makes it great for demonstrating your ideas to non-experts, or even to other experts who are struggling to follow your line of thinking. Writing out your planned approach in this methodical way also acts as an amazing sanity-check for yourself on your ideas before you hurl yourself into your Jupyter notebook and start waving scikit-learn and pytorch around and spouting nonsense.\n\nYou can even code in Excel if you desperately want to (I once wrote a K-means clustering algorithm in VBA for God\u2019s sake, with a big juicy macro button in the sheet for the user to press). I can assure you there is nothing that management / clients love more than a big button to push, and nothing that they hate more than an unfamiliar environment (i.e. giving them a presentation which involves scrolling through a Jupyter notebook that they don't understand).\n\nSummary\n\nThese are the main problems I see with data scientists. I\u2019m sure this post will get downvoted into oblivion, but if you want advice from the guy who\u2019s been in your shoes and is now doing the hiring, then I would recommend the following:\n\n\u00b7 Get good at [mathematical modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model), not \u201cdata science\u201d. This will let you take the vague BS that managers say they want and turn it into a solvable mathematical problem that mirrors what they actually meant. Additionally, most company data is of too poor quality to use in most fancy data science algorithms anyway. You can call yourself a data scientist if that's the buzzword that gets you the job, but this is the underlying skill you are likely to need.\n\n\u00b7 Get your probability &amp; statistics sharp. I\u2019m talking razor-sharp. Not the fancy BS about \u201cBayesian reasoning\u201d or any of that other crap, but the fundamentals. Are you happy with what an expected value is? Are you happy with conditional probability? Do you understand that subtracting the probability of an event happening from 1 is equal to the probability of it not happening? Are you happy with the probabilistic equivalents of [De Morgan\u2019s laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws)? Do you understand how to calculate probabilities correctly from vague language statements (e.g. if I roll a dice 6 times, what is the probability that a 2 will have been rolled at some point during those 6 rolls)? I hope you got 66.5% because that\u2019s what the answer is. What about things like simple random simulations? Could you code 10,000 simulations of a random walk with adjustable parameters? This stuff should be like breathing to you.\n\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t be snotty about tools that management like to use just because it isn\u2019t Python code in a Jupyter notebook. You\u2019re the data scientist \u2013 make the tools work for you.\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\*: A number of commentators have been asking where are some good repositories of statistical knowledge to help them develop greater understanding. I would recommend starting with [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest/playlists) over on youtube, particularly their [Statistics Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBigTkBLU6g&amp;list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9) playlist (they also have their own [website](https://statquest.org/)). You can then start combining the information from there with the tutorials over on [Stat Trek](https://stattrek.com/probability/set-and-subset?tutorial=prob#) and [StatLect](https://www.statlect.com/). Once you have given these a good going over, go and grab the PDF of \"All of Statistics\" by Larry Wasserman, a version of which is available [in this link](https://egrcc.github.io/docs/math/all-of-statistics.pdf). Once you have made serious inroads into this book, you will have a far better understanding of how to think about probability and statistics. Don't forget that you will need to translate the things you learn in these sources into your favourite code yourself... exactly like you would have to do in your actual job as a data scientist.\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT 2\\*\\*\\*: People seem to be misunderstanding what I'm saying in the \"Get your probability sharp\" bullet point (probably my fault for not being clearer). I'm not saying that you should do this because it's the \"correct\" thing to do, or that only \"true\" data scientists possess this ability, or that you're an imposter if you don't do it, or that I'm superior for knowing it, or any of that. I am literally stating the fact that if you acquire these rudimentary skills, your ability to put together your own models for arbitrary \"data science\" problems will skyrocket and you will therefore be more impressive to employers (whether prospective or current). Same as, if you wanted to be able to dance with great ease, the first few things to sort out would be your balance, footwork, ankle, knee and hip strength, etc. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to do it. You are no less of a person if you don't do it, and no-one is saying you are. But **in this one specific part of the totality that is your life**, you will still (obviously) be regarded as less effective than a competitor who can do these things. As for the comments about privilege and educational opportunities, guys you've got to be kidding me. You have the internet. Use it. You have youtube. Watch it. What, you mean you're perfectly capable of hunting down [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp/videos) army of coding videos to educate yourselves about coding, but it somehow never occurred to you that you could do the same to boost your maths and stats abilities? How do you think I originally found the links in the previous edit? If you're willing to call yourself a data scientist after self-educating yourself about it using online courses, is it really that much of a stretch to apply the same self-educating impetus to the maths and stats that underly the field of \"data science\"?\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT 3\\*\\*\\*: Some folks are asking about a good resource for the kind of mathematical modelling I mean. [Here is a link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBwYIM5fyr-PPD69X6Wcc8JgqZNz49Ko/view?usp=share_link) to the \"mathematical modelling\" booklet that was part of the optimization module on our engineering degree. It is an excellent resource, festooned with examples and answers. The university was [The Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/) in the UK and they are incredible to study with, and completely distance learning. I cannot recommend them highly enough (you can see the quality of the material from the PDF and that's just from a very dry maths module, their engineering ones are even better). I don't know how much they cost for international students, but if you're based in the UK it was circa \u00a35400 a year for me to study there (you will be able to get a student loan if it's your first degree, and the UK only starts taking money from your salary to pay it off after you start earning \u00a327,000 or thereabouts, at which point it's 9% of everything that you earn over \u00a327,000 until you've paid it off or until 30 years is up, at which point it gets written off). The degree was Engineering, and there is a [BEng](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/engineering/degrees/bachelor-of-engineering-q65) and an [MEng](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/engineering/degrees/integrated-master-of-engineering-m04) available for anyone who's interested, both of which are accredited by the [Engineering Council](https://www.engc.org.uk/).", "author_fullname": "t2_5s0mksvu", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Advice for data scientists", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_133n4a1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 745, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 745, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1682887115.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1682855375.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, I have always occupied roles which closely resembled what people seem to be talking about when they talk about \u201cdata science\u201d.

This will let you take the vague BS that managers say they want and turn it into a solvable mathematical problem that mirrors what they actually meant. Additionally, most company data is of too poor quality to use in most fancy data science algorithms anyway. You can call yourself a data scientist if that&amp;#39;s the buzzword that gets you the job, but this is the underlying skill you are likely to need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Get your probability &amp;amp; statistics sharp. I\u2019m talking razor-sharp. Not the fancy BS about \u201cBayesian reasoning\u201d or any of that other crap, but the fundamentals. Are you happy with what an expected value is? Are you happy with conditional probability? Do you understand that subtracting the probability of an event happening from 1 is equal to the probability of it not happening? Are you happy with the probabilistic equivalents of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws\"&gt;De Morgan\u2019s laws&lt;/a&gt;? Do you understand how to calculate probabilities correctly from vague language statements (e.g. if I roll a dice 6 times, what is the probability that a 2 will have been rolled at some point during those 6 rolls)? I hope you got 66.5% because that\u2019s what the answer is. What about things like simple random simulations? Could you code 10,000 simulations of a random walk with adjustable parameters? This stuff should be like breathing to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Don\u2019t be snotty about tools that management like to use just because it isn\u2019t Python code in a Jupyter notebook. You\u2019re the data scientist \u2013 make the tools work for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***EDIT***: A number of commentators have been asking where are some good repositories of statistical knowledge to help them develop greater understanding. I would recommend starting with &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@statquest/playlists\"&gt;StatQuest&lt;/a&gt; over on youtube, particularly their &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBigTkBLU6g&amp;amp;list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9\"&gt;Statistics Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; playlist (they also have their own &lt;a href=\"https://statquest.org/\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;). You can then start combining the information from there with the tutorials over on &lt;a href=\"https://stattrek.com/probability/set-and-subset?tutorial=prob#\"&gt;Stat Trek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.statlect.com/\"&gt;StatLect&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have given these a good going over, go and grab the PDF of &amp;quot;All of Statistics&amp;quot; by Larry Wasserman, a version of which is available &lt;a href=\"https://egrcc.github.io/docs/math/all-of-statistics.pdf\"&gt;in this link&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have made serious inroads into this book, you will have a far better understanding of how to think about probability and statistics. Don&amp;#39;t forget that you will need to translate the things you learn in these sources into your favourite code yourself... exactly like you would have to do in your actual job as a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***EDIT 2***: People seem to be misunderstanding what I&amp;#39;m saying in the &amp;quot;Get your probability sharp&amp;quot; bullet point (probably my fault for not being clearer). I&amp;#39;m not saying that you should do this because it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; thing to do, or that only &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; data scientists possess this ability, or that you&amp;#39;re an imposter if you don&amp;#39;t do it, or that I&amp;#39;m superior for knowing it, or any of that. I am literally stating the fact that if you acquire these rudimentary skills, your ability to put together your own models for arbitrary &amp;quot;data science&amp;quot; problems will skyrocket and you will therefore be more impressive to employers (whether prospective or current). Same as, if you wanted to be able to dance with great ease, the first few things to sort out would be your balance, footwork, ankle, knee and hip strength, etc. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to do it. You are no less of a person if you don&amp;#39;t do it, and no-one is saying you are. But &lt;strong&gt;in this one specific part of the totality that is your life&lt;/strong&gt;, you will still (obviously) be regarded as less effective than a competitor who can do these things. As for the comments about privilege and educational opportunities, guys you&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding me. You have the internet. Use it. You have youtube. Watch it. What, you mean you&amp;#39;re perfectly capable of hunting down &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp/videos\"&gt;FreeCodeCamp&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; army of coding videos to educate yourselves about coding, but it somehow never occurred to you that you could do the same to boost your maths and stats abilities? How do you think I originally found the links in the previous edit? If you&amp;#39;re willing to call yourself a data scientist after self-educating yourself about it using online courses, is it really that much of a stretch to apply the same self-educating impetus to the maths and stats that underly the field of &amp;quot;data science&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***EDIT 3***: Some folks are asking about a good resource for the kind of mathematical modelling I mean. &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBwYIM5fyr-PPD69X6Wcc8JgqZNz49Ko/view?usp=share_link\"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; to the &amp;quot;mathematical modelling&amp;quot; booklet that was part of the optimization module on our engineering degree. It is an excellent resource, festooned with examples and answers. The university was &lt;a href=\"https://www.open.ac.uk/\"&gt;The Open University&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and they are incredible to study with, and completely distance learning. I cannot recommend them highly enough (you can see the quality of the material from the PDF and that&amp;#39;s just from a very dry maths module, their engineering ones are even better). I don&amp;#39;t know how much they cost for international students, but if you&amp;#39;re based in the UK it was circa \u00a35400 a year for me to study there (you will be able to get a student loan if it&amp;#39;s your first degree, and the UK only starts taking money from your salary to pay it off after you start earning \u00a327,000 or thereabouts, at which point it&amp;#39;s 9% of everything that you earn over \u00a327,000 until you&amp;#39;ve paid it off or until 30 years is up, at which point it gets written off). The degree was Engineering, and there is a &lt;a href=\"https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/engineering/degrees/bachelor-of-engineering-q65\"&gt;BEng&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/engineering/degrees/integrated-master-of-engineering-m04\"&gt;MEng&lt;/a&gt; available for anyone who&amp;#39;s interested, both of which are accredited by the &lt;a href=\"https://www.engc.org.uk/\"&gt;Engineering Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null,

finding out a large number of job postings on the internet every day  over the last 10 years - I could then calculate the average number of jobs that required software such as SAS, R and Python ...

how can I find access historical job postings in Data Science? \n\nThe first idea that comes to mind is to use job sites that post job openings like Indeed. I have been trying to see if there is an API that lets you download historical job openings along with the software requirements - this way, I could begin my analysis. But so far, I not found anything that lets me do this exactly.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas about this?\n\nIs there a way to download historical job postings and software requirements in such a way that I can analyze if on average fewer jobs over the years require SAS?\n\nThanks!", "author_fullname": "t2_3tosvccj", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Data Science Project: Analyze Job Requirements Over the Last 10 Years", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "projects", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 65, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"sf6kffk045xa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 50, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0781f3712e87d8b9157159e14098e23169a63e4b"}, {"y": 100, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7a4f7e930d017cbeb082f5f0390ad5acfb30af95"}, {"y": 148, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c9e688cffa5aa3f98ae85e8e5e2233b60d12e188"}, {"y": 297, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=185eb854aa7b912d560835d6509f818bb99692ed"}, {"y": 446, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b784d9d943997eb1a43d0af52448b4981c7f0f10"}, {"y": 502, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1bca0fbb6cd43ce1b9fae0bdbb989b508cd0c1ea"}], "s": {"y": 879, "x": 1889, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=1889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0af5d6a6157eb89e95507d4543b1dbeb4f648e5"}, "id": "sf6kffk045xa1"}}, "name": "t3_134bmrk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Projects", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wYdBxrWwtw55AmYuNoljcus_qOU_hxGS-dADc3ysh3Y.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1682912380.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a friend and I were having a discussion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this discussion, I had this hypothesis that SAS software (&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software)&lt;/a&gt;)) today has likely become less popular in the world compared to what its popularity 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, I thought that one thing we could do was to look in Data Science job trends over the last 10 years:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sf6kffk045xa1.png?width=1889&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=c0af5d6a6157eb89e95507d4543b1dbeb4f648e5\"&gt;Screenshot for a Data Science Job Posting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, suppose I has some way of finding out a large number of job postings on the internet every day  over the last 10 years - I could then calculate the average number of jobs that required software such as SAS, R and Python ... and then observe if there a statistically significant downwards trend in jobs that require SAS over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about this idea as a cool side hobby project - as such, how can I find access historical job postings in Data Science? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first idea that comes to mind is to use job sites that post job openings like Indeed.
