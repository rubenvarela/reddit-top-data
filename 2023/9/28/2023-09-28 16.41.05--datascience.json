Labwork consists of 5 parts and part one is to do an input data analysis, do some descriptive summary statistics, do some plots, make a few manipulations to the data where needed. So descriptive summary statistics part requires me to do a specific data quality report, more specifically it asks me to provide [count, missing_value_%, mode, mode_freq, mode_%, 2nd_mode, 2nd_mode_freq, 2nd_mode_%] for categorical features. \n\nSo as just a default pd.describe() was not enough for it, i did the whole thing manually using .agg() and combining default aggregation functions with my custom functions. This is where I got stuck.\n\nI spent the whole day trying to write a function that would calculate the modes for me and would work together with other functions inside .agg(). In the end I failed and just decided to do a separate mode dataframe that I later just concatenate to the output of df.agg(). \n\nHow do I actually learn all these technical and trivial stuff? Manipulating dataframes, series, permuting them the way I want (also, the same applies to all other \u201csmall stuff\u201d in coding - manipulating strings, lists/dicts, applying functions to dataframes and so on)?

Labwork consists of 5 parts and part one is to do an input data analysis, do some descriptive summary statistics, do some plots, make a few manipulations to the data where needed. So descriptive summary statistics part requires me to do a specific data quality report, more specifically it asks me to provide [count, missing&lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;%, mode, mode&lt;em&gt;freq, mode&lt;/em&gt;%, 2nd&lt;em&gt;mode, 2nd_mode_freq, 2nd_mode&lt;/em&gt;%] for categorical features. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as just a default pd.describe() was not enough for it, i did the whole thing manually using .agg() and combining default aggregation functions with my custom functions. This is where I got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the whole day trying to write a function that would calculate the modes for me and would work together with other functions inside .agg().
