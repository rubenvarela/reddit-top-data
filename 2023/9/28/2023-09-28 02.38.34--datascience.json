Previous videos I&amp;#39;ve seen of LLMs playing chess are funny at some point, where the ChatGPT teleports and revives pieces at will. The biggest &amp;quot;issues&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve run into with ParrotChess is that it doesn&amp;#39;t recognize things like three-fold repetition and will do it ad infinitum.

In my current project, I have used Python libraries such as Pypdfium2, Pdfplumber \u2013 py, camelot, and Tabula \u2013 py to extract various sections from two different types of PDF reports. However, I now have many different PDF formats that need to be extracted in a structured format. Are there any paid tools that would be more effective than developing a custom solution? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried using LLM models for PDF extraction?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is anyone using Azure AI Document Intelligence in production for such tasks?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "16u038j", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "prtkkr", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/16u038j/pdf_scraping/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16u038j/pdf_scraping/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1063482, "created_utc": 1695858081.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI'm looking for guidance and support in my career as a Data Analyst in the energy sector.
