Labwork consists of 5 parts and part one is to do an input data analysis, do some descriptive summary statistics, do some plots, make a few manipulations to the data where needed. So descriptive summary statistics part requires me to do a specific data quality report, more specifically it asks me to provide [count, missing&lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;%, mode, mode&lt;em&gt;freq, mode&lt;/em&gt;%, 2nd&lt;em&gt;mode, 2nd_mode_freq, 2nd_mode&lt;/em&gt;%] for categorical features. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as just a default pd.describe() was not enough for it, i did the whole thing manually using .agg() and combining default aggregation functions with my custom functions. This is where I got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the whole day trying to write a function that would calculate the modes for me and would work together with other functions inside .agg(). In the end I failed and just decided to do a separate mode dataframe that I later just concatenate to the output of df.agg(). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I actually learn all these technical and trivial stuff?

Would I be mistaken if I used this process to test for and indicate that white noise has been achieved (ie, no serial correlations)? I would also combine it with output from an ACF plot and a Ljung-Box test, just to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, will this process capture incomplete, intermediate frequencies? What I mean is, for example, if I have a time series of, say 10,000 observations, which show a consistent frequency all the way across but somewhere in the middle, another different frequency appears alongside that lasts for only 3,000 observations before it disappears, will that transient frequency be detected, even though it isn&amp;#39;t present throughout the entire time series? Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just need a sanity check to make sure I&amp;#39;m not all the way out in left field (or even outside the stadium, in the parking lot).
