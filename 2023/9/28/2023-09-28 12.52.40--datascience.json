So far my projects involve binary classifiers, where I do some data cleaning, impute missing values, drop features which have very low variance, and throw them into a tree based model for classification which I then tune using hyperopt. \n\nI don\u2019t really understand the data I\u2019m working with, since there\u2019s like 100s of columns of semiconductor test measurements and even my manager doesn\u2019t seem to have to time to explain what each feature means. \n\nEven though this field is supposed to be heavy on math and stats, I barely find myself analyzing or understanding the data here and doing little to no stats, other than checking for correlation and variance of my features so that I can keep or drop them.\n\nRecently I got a task to build a neural net from scratch for the same binary classification problem. I\u2019ve been randomly googling and trying a bunch of combinations of layers, neurons, optimizers, etc. and it\u2019s just not working because my model is overfitting. To tackle overfitting I\u2019ve tried dropout, regularization, etc basically everything I could find on articles online but nope it\u2019s still doing bad.\n\nMy manager is not a data scientist but does have a good understanding of the field. He\u2019s unable to help me with specifics like how do I know when a neural network will never work for my dataset, or out of the infinite combinations of number of layers, neurons, deciding the value of weight decay, or the eps and beta values of the Adam optimizer\u2026 etc how do I choose the right combination. \n\nNone of my proof of concept models have worked and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019m not trying hard enough or looking at the wrong places or I\u2019m just too inexperienced. I often end up telling my manager all the things I\u2019ve tried and that it didn\u2019t work. He usually just takes my word, and lets it go. But I always wonder, if a better data scientist would have been able to get it to work unlike me.\n\nThere are senior and principal level data scientists in my team but they are not involved in my projects and I can\u2019t really get much help from them because then I\u2019d have to explain my whole project which they don\u2019t really have the time to sit through.\n\nI know there is a lot of ambiguity in this field especially when it comes to modeling which I\u2019m starting to hate and I\u2019m wondering if I should  switch to being a data analyst/business analyst \n\nI don\u2019t really go out of my way to read papers or keep myself updated on the latest developments in this field. I just do what is asked of me and I\u2019m wondering if this will make me an easy target for layoffs as well. \n\nJust wanted to know if I\u2019m only one facing this or there\u2019s something seriously wrong with the way I\u2019m working.", "author_fullname": "t2_17czuk", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Hoping to get some guidance from experienced data scientists as a noob", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_16tqu7w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1695836010.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a lot of rambling in this post so please bear with me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I graduated with an MS in EE while specializing in deep learning a few months back.\n I\u2019ve been working as a data scientist in a semiconductor company for like 4 months and I\u2019m starting to hate this field, to the point where I\u2019m questioning if I even deserve to be this field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I definitely feel like I\u2019m gonna be mediocre in this field. So far my projects involve binary classifiers, where I do some data cleaning, impute missing values, drop features which have very low variance, and throw them into a tree based model for classification which I then tune using hyperopt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t really understand the data I\u2019m working with, since there\u2019s like 100s of columns of semiconductor test measurements and even my manager doesn\u2019t seem to have to time to explain what each feature means. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though this field is supposed to be heavy on math and stats, I barely find myself analyzing or understanding the data here and doing little to no stats, other than checking for correlation and variance of my features so that I can keep or drop them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I got a task to build a neural net from scratch for the same binary classification problem. I\u2019ve been randomly googling and trying a bunch of combinations of layers, neurons, optimizers, etc. and it\u2019s just not working because my model is overfitting. To tackle overfitting I\u2019ve tried dropout, regularization, etc basically everything I could find on articles online but nope it\u2019s still doing bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My manager is not a data scientist but does have a good understanding of the field. He\u2019s unable to help me with specifics like how do I know when a neural network will never work for my dataset, or out of the infinite combinations of number of layers, neurons, deciding the value of weight decay, or the eps and beta values of the Adam optimizer\u2026 etc how do I choose the right combination. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of my proof of concept models have worked and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019m not trying hard enough or looking at the wrong places or I\u2019m just too inexperienced. I often end up telling my manager all the things I\u2019ve tried and that it didn\u2019t work. He usually just takes my word, and lets it go. But I always wonder, if a better data scientist would have been able to get it to work unlike me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are senior and principal level data scientists in my team but they are not involved in my projects and I can\u2019t really get much help from them because then I\u2019d have to explain my whole project which they don\u2019t really have the time to sit through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there is a lot of ambiguity in this field especially when it comes to modeling which I\u2019m starting to hate and I\u2019m wondering if I should  switch to being a data analyst/business analyst &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t really go out of my way to read papers or keep myself updated on the latest developments in this field.
