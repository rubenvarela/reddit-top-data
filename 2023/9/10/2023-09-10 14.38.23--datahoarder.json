I changed the AMD Bulldozer platform to Intel C232 + Pentium G4400 and added more RAM (now 2x4 GB ECC RAM since this platform supports ECC). \\[I could swap the 2-core Pentium for a 4-core Xeon E3\\*-V5 for cheap nowadays if needed. But right now, it doesn't seem to be a bottleneck at all.\\]\n\nI update my Gentoo OS regularly. I also enable all new stable Btrfs features (the last boot speed boost thingy included).\n\nDespite running defrag and balance (with filters to balance low-usage chunks only) as nightly cronjobs, the performance is now far from expected. And I am not talking about write speeds, even read speeds don't hit the theoretical speeds. Both buffered and directio reads of big files (which are defragged) don't reach 4x of the lowest speed expected from a single disk. Meanwhile, nmon report 50% utilization of most disks (one disk sometimes hits close to \\~100% but not all the time). The CPU usage is fairly low, most of the RAM is used for cache.\n\nThese drives should read at least 85 MB/s (185 max at the outer edge of the disk). The hdparm -t --direct benchmark reports \\~185 MB/s on a single disk (for some reason, hdparm without --directio reports significantly slower speeds on both my OS SSD and data HDDs but that's another story, see the link below if you are interested...).\n\n[https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/756150/585216](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/756150/585216)\n\nI can't tell when things regressed. Maybe Btrfs RAID-5 never has been as efficient with 5 disks as with 3 disks. Maybe it's a regressing in code over time, possibly even caused by bug fixes and reliability enhancements. I don't know, I can't find it out on my own and nobody seems willing to help.... I think I wrote an email about this to the Btrfs mailing list to no avail some years(!) ago (I remember at least considering it, maybe I eventually didn't or wrote to some other forum, I don't know). I recently opened a topic about this on Gentoo Forums and nobody replies... I guess 99% just assumes that \"nay and all software RAID-5 is useless\" and/or \"Btrfs is just useless\", \"buy a good RAID controller, use md-raid, use ZFS\" etc. (\\*\\*\\*The only reason I hate ZFS is that it still doesn't have a defrag feature and it fragmented a lot during the short time I tested it for my usage mode.\\*\\*\\*) Or \"you don't need RAID, you need more backups\"... -&gt; You know, the usual...\n\n[https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8801003.html#8801003](https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8801003.html#8801003)\n\nSo, I decided to take a fresh look at Storage Spaces (Direct).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I set this home server up, I researched and tested Storage Spaces with ReFS. But these were both very new/experimental back then. I messed around with the column size / cluster size trick to no avail but I read that it works now, so write speed is not handicapped. And I read that ReFS \"self-healing\" now works with Parity type storage Spaces (this feature wasn't available \\~10 years ago, only worked for mirrors).\n\nOther things are RDMA and SSD caching. My 10Gbe NICs supported RDMA \\~10 years ago, Windows supports it, Samba implementation on Linux is still coming \"any *century* now\" (make sure to eat healthy and quit smoking if you want to see it! :D), just like Btrfs's SSD caching.\n\nWell, to be more precise, RDMA is supported by the semi-recently introduced Kernel SMB server implementation. But it still lacks some very basic features like mapping Linux users to Windows account names/emails and I couldn't really get it working with Linux 6.5 and Windows 11 22H2 with any user / login settings to test it (at least not with Windows File Explorer but Owl File Explorer worked for a single session only and then I wasn't able to reconnect, so it's far from stable...).\n\nAnd I know bcache and dm-cache/LVM-cache exist on Linux (I could probably even set them up in-place and online by pulling out a single disk, formatting it and adding it back to the FS and balancing the FS, rinse, repeat until all 5 are reformatted...) but I don't like their feature sets (and the things I read about them from those who tested/used them for similar things I am using this home server). I think I *ideally* want read-only caching with some \"smart\" algorithm that fills the cache with the most frequently used disk blocks/chunks. There is volatile RAM for regular buffered writes and rotating read-cache. Ideally, I wish to use a small Optane M10 drive with slow write but fast read characteristics to keep a non-volatile cache which eventually fills up with mostly filesystem metadata (for fast searching / directory browsing). I figure that caching small-sized reads only should achieve that. I only have free slots/lanes for a single PCI-e v3.0 2x drive (I planned to use this for an Optane M10 swap drive on Linux but I only need swap during Gentoo world updates with compile tasks, so I wouldn't need that on Windows if I transitioned to Storage Spaces \\[Direct\\], a simple swapfile on a slow SATAII SSD would do and the Optane could be added/bound to the storage pool).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I am not sure how stable ReFS really is nowadays. Some \\~10 years ago it was good for nothing but temporary storage of data you can afford to lose any moment (a simple power outage could render it irreparably unmountable and practically no affordable recovery tools existed to scrap together the lost files). Does \"self-healing\" really work (even for corruption due to random power loos, a.k.a. \"write hole(s)\")?\n\nAnd I am at a loss about how to set up Storage Spaces with SSD caching through PowerShell. I find it more complicated than setting up the entire Gentoo system from scratch with a custom-configured kernel (it boots directly from Btrfs in UEFI mode, I have no bootmanager, no initramfs, no systemd, no dedicated boot partition, no nothing nonsense/bloat of the sorts... I like how elegant and minimalistic/simple it is, I am sort of proud of it... but I digress... no matter how nice it is on paper if it's inferior in practice...). Mostly because there was documentation for Linux (even for the advanced stuff and for the adventurus).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just set up a Windows 11 22H2 Enterprise (not LTSC) virtual machine on my desktop computer (same OS) with extra 3 HDD and 1 SSD SATA drives (the NVMe controller causes a VirtualBox error) for testing Storage Spaces.\n\nThe GUI is utterly useless for even the simplest 3xHDD Parity setup (let alone SSD caching of a pool) but coming from a head-less, desktop-less Linux, PowerShell is not something I despise if it works and can be figured out. But the documentation got very loose below my feet when I tried to figure out \"advanced/adventurous\" functionality.\n\nI am not even sure if I can set things up on the Enterprise edition or if I **absolutely** need the Server edition for SSD caching. Mind that I want read-only caching, not write-through or brite-back, and definitely not Parity-WBC (since I wish to skip that last bit by optimizing column size / cluster size). And I can only use a single SSD. (By the way, mandating 2+ SSDs for write caching is ridiculous in my opinion. Volatile RAM is often used for write buffering and I am not even sure if mirrored RAM mode exists for regular servers \\[maybe does for some special platforms, but....\\].)\n\nMost of the commands I tried worked so far. Well, I mean they execute. But for example, Set-StorageBusCache says the help file is incomplete and Update-Help Set-StorageBusCache drops an error. From the looks of it, there is no \"complete help\" for this at all.\n\nI am far from a working prototype. I seemingly hit a loose end with StorageBusCache because\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-storage-bus-cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-storage-bus-cache#prerequisites)\n\ndoesn't have detailed documentation. I could probably \"solder through\" it by trial-and-error but... meh... I am not even sure this does something close enough to what I wish to achieve. And since all the virtual disks are VHD files on the same NVMe SSD on the host system, I won't be able to benchmark a pool when it eventually gets created. (I currently have zero HDDs I could use. May be a slower SSD...) This StorageBusCache looks too rigid.\n\n*\"There's no cmdlet to unbind/rebind existing bindings and balance the relationship. The following steps cause the existing read cache to be lost.\"*\n\nThis seemingly implies that the cache device can't be replaced (in case it physically breaks). But I can't find other Storage Spaces options that don't require 2+ SSDs or aren't limited clusters with 2+ nodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStorage Spaces Direct seems to be more flexible, \"dynamic\" even...\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/concepts/cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/concepts/cache)\n\nBut it seemingly requires 2+ SSDs (although a lot of pictures show 1 SSD connected to several HDDs but that might be simplified for explaining other aspects of the pools/caching) or even a cluster of 2+ servers. Would it still work with a warning shown non-stop about \"I need at least one more SSD!\" and \"Your other cluster members seem to be offline. Please sort that out!\" ???\n\nAt any rate, I can't even execute Get-ClusterStorageSpacesDirect on Windows Enterprise, so this probably REALLY needs a Server edition (of which I am entirely unfamiliar with but I downloaded the evaluation ISO already, I just need to find the time and will to check it out).\n\nThe StorageBusCache documentation states that it's based on the SSD cluster solution but made working with solo systems. Why is it so much more rigid regarding adding/removing caches then (if the cluster setup is so flexible and dynamic)? Do they plan to lift those restrictions in the not-so-distant future? Does StorageBusCache work differently in Preview builds?\n\nAccording to these docs, solely read-only caching doesn't even available yet for either SS or SS-D. (But all the Linux feature I was looking for \\~10 years ago are still \"any century now\" while SS got a lot of features in the meantime.) So new caching modes might arrive sooner to SS than Btrfs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut all-in-all, to be honest, SSD caching would only be a plus. If I could just read/write with close to the raw speed of 4 disks on the 5-disk Parity pool without losing any relevant Btrfs RAID-5 features (checksumming and self-healing, defragging, etc), it would be a win to transition to Storage Spaces.\n\nOf course, the best solution right now would be a fix for the Btrfs speed issue. Maybe I just misconfigured something or there is a workaround for a bug...?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts? (Haha!

I changed the AMD Bulldozer platform to Intel C232 + Pentium G4400 and added more RAM (now 2x4 GB ECC RAM since this platform supports ECC). [I could swap the 2-core Pentium for a 4-core Xeon E3*-V5 for cheap nowadays if needed. But right now, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a bottleneck at all.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I update my Gentoo OS regularly. I also enable all new stable Btrfs features (the last boot speed boost thingy included).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite running defrag and balance (with filters to balance low-usage chunks only) as nightly cronjobs, the performance is now far from expected. And I am not talking about write speeds, even read speeds don&amp;#39;t hit the theoretical speeds. Both buffered and directio reads of big files (which are defragged) don&amp;#39;t reach 4x of the lowest speed expected from a single disk. Meanwhile, nmon report 50% utilization of most disks (one disk sometimes hits close to ~100% but not all the time). The CPU usage is fairly low, most of the RAM is used for cache.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These drives should read at least 85 MB/s (185 max at the outer edge of the disk). The hdparm -t --direct benchmark reports ~185 MB/s on a single disk (for some reason, hdparm without --directio reports significantly slower speeds on both my OS SSD and data HDDs but that&amp;#39;s another story, see the link below if you are interested...).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/756150/585216\"&gt;https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/756150/585216&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell when things regressed. Maybe Btrfs RAID-5 never has been as efficient with 5 disks as with 3 disks. Maybe it&amp;#39;s a regressing in code over time, possibly even caused by bug fixes and reliability enhancements. I don&amp;#39;t know, I can&amp;#39;t find it out on my own and nobody seems willing to help.... I think I wrote an email about this to the Btrfs mailing list to no avail some years(!) ago (I remember at least considering it, maybe I eventually didn&amp;#39;t or wrote to some other forum, I don&amp;#39;t know). I recently opened a topic about this on Gentoo Forums and nobody replies... I guess 99% just assumes that &amp;quot;nay and all software RAID-5 is useless&amp;quot; and/or &amp;quot;Btrfs is just useless&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;buy a good RAID controller, use md-raid, use ZFS&amp;quot; etc. (***The only reason I hate ZFS is that it still doesn&amp;#39;t have a defrag feature and it fragmented a lot during the short time I tested it for my usage mode.***) Or &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t need RAID, you need more backups&amp;quot;... -&amp;gt; You know, the usual...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8801003.html#8801003\"&gt;https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8801003.html#8801003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to take a fresh look at Storage Spaces (Direct).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I set this home server up, I researched and tested Storage Spaces with ReFS. But these were both very new/experimental back then. I messed around with the column size / cluster size trick to no avail but I read that it works now, so write speed is not handicapped. And I read that ReFS &amp;quot;self-healing&amp;quot; now works with Parity type storage Spaces (this feature wasn&amp;#39;t available ~10 years ago, only worked for mirrors).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other things are RDMA and SSD caching. My 10Gbe NICs supported RDMA ~10 years ago, Windows supports it, Samba implementation on Linux is still coming &amp;quot;any &lt;em&gt;century&lt;/em&gt; now&amp;quot; (make sure to eat healthy and quit smoking if you want to see it! :D), just like Btrfs&amp;#39;s SSD caching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, to be more precise, RDMA is supported by the semi-recently introduced Kernel SMB server implementation. But it still lacks some very basic features like mapping Linux users to Windows account names/emails and I couldn&amp;#39;t really get it working with Linux 6.5 and Windows 11 22H2 with any user / login settings to test it (at least not with Windows File Explorer but Owl File Explorer worked for a single session only and then I wasn&amp;#39;t able to reconnect, so it&amp;#39;s far from stable...).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know bcache and dm-cache/LVM-cache exist on Linux (I could probably even set them up in-place and online by pulling out a single disk, formatting it and adding it back to the FS and balancing the FS, rinse, repeat until all 5 are reformatted...) but I don&amp;#39;t like their feature sets (and the things I read about them from those who tested/used them for similar things I am using this home server). I think I &lt;em&gt;ideally&lt;/em&gt; want read-only caching with some &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; algorithm that fills the cache with the most frequently used disk blocks/chunks. There is volatile RAM for regular buffered writes and rotating read-cache. Ideally, I wish to use a small Optane M10 drive with slow write but fast read characteristics to keep a non-volatile cache which eventually fills up with mostly filesystem metadata (for fast searching / directory browsing). I figure that caching small-sized reads only should achieve that. I only have free slots/lanes for a single PCI-e v3.0 2x drive (I planned to use this for an Optane M10 swap drive on Linux but I only need swap during Gentoo world updates with compile tasks, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t need that on Windows if I transitioned to Storage Spaces [Direct], a simple swapfile on a slow SATAII SSD would do and the Optane could be added/bound to the storage pool).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I am not sure how stable ReFS really is nowadays. Some ~10 years ago it was good for nothing but temporary storage of data you can afford to lose any moment (a simple power outage could render it irreparably unmountable and practically no affordable recovery tools existed to scrap together the lost files). Does &amp;quot;self-healing&amp;quot; really work (even for corruption due to random power loos, a.k.a. &amp;quot;write hole(s)&amp;quot;)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I am at a loss about how to set up Storage Spaces with SSD caching through PowerShell. I find it more complicated than setting up the entire Gentoo system from scratch with a custom-configured kernel (it boots directly from Btrfs in UEFI mode, I have no bootmanager, no initramfs, no systemd, no dedicated boot partition, no nothing nonsense/bloat of the sorts... I like how elegant and minimalistic/simple it is, I am sort of proud of it... but I digress... no matter how nice it is on paper if it&amp;#39;s inferior in practice...). Mostly because there was documentation for Linux (even for the advanced stuff and for the adventurus).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just set up a Windows 11 22H2 Enterprise (not LTSC) virtual machine on my desktop computer (same OS) with extra 3 HDD and 1 SSD SATA drives (the NVMe controller causes a VirtualBox error) for testing Storage Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The GUI is utterly useless for even the simplest 3xHDD Parity setup (let alone SSD caching of a pool) but coming from a head-less, desktop-less Linux, PowerShell is not something I despise if it works and can be figured out. But the documentation got very loose below my feet when I tried to figure out &amp;quot;advanced/adventurous&amp;quot; functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not even sure if I can set things up on the Enterprise edition or if I &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; need the Server edition for SSD caching. Mind that I want read-only caching, not write-through or brite-back, and definitely not Parity-WBC (since I wish to skip that last bit by optimizing column size / cluster size). And I can only use a single SSD. (By the way, mandating 2+ SSDs for write caching is ridiculous in my opinion. Volatile RAM is often used for write buffering and I am not even sure if mirrored RAM mode exists for regular servers [maybe does for some special platforms, but....].)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the commands I tried worked so far. Well, I mean they execute. But for example, Set-StorageBusCache says the help file is incomplete and Update-Help Set-StorageBusCache drops an error. From the looks of it, there is no &amp;quot;complete help&amp;quot; for this at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am far from a working prototype. I seemingly hit a loose end with StorageBusCache because&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-storage-bus-cache#prerequisites\"&gt;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-storage-bus-cache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t have detailed documentation.
