It's possible that this will be a duplicate, but I'm sorry, I can't get it. I can't believe my situation has no solution. To present the situation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have a paid static public ip address at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** I would like to access my services also from outside home. (Like Synology Photos, (Smarthome) Home Assistant, Plex, selfhosted Bitwarden etc etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** The condition is the use of Android apps (not Chrome). (E.g. DS file, DS note, Plex app, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** To make it relatively safe (I understand that nothing in IT is 100% safe, it's about the ratio between safety and convenience)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** On my router, forward the ports to the given services. Done. Easy.\n\n***Result:*** IT suicide. Extremely dangerous. Ok let's move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** Expose only port 443 to the Internet and run a reverse proxy at my home.\n\n***Result:*** Slightly better security than number 1. But I'm still not satisfied. Anyone can still try to hack directly into the services. E.g. if it becomes vulnerable in Plex, it will compromise the entire local LAN. The only security is that of a specific service. (I mean the login screen)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** Expose only port 443 to the Internet and run a reverse proxy at my home. + Add another authorization layer. Like Authelia.\n\n***Result:*** I would be very satisfied with this solution. Unfortunately, Android apps do not support this and I have not found a way to solve it. It works in Android Chrome, but it's not what I can ask of all household members.\n\n*^(Can not be used)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** Expose only port 443 to the Internet and run a reverse proxy at my home. + Authenticate connections based on client certificates.\n\n***Result:*** Beautiful, I also really like this solution. And I would be happy with this solution. But unfortunately, even if I install a new certificate in the Android system, it can only be used again in Chrome. Unfortunately, the Android apps ignores the certificate in the system and does not connect. :(\n\n*^(Can not be used)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** Use a VPN\n\n***Result:*** Wow, an epic solution. Best of all, it won't even be hack by the NSA (joke). I would love to use this. But from a user point of view, it is extremely inconvenient for my family. Before viewing photos, for example, you must start and connect to a VPN and after use disconnect. Or you have to connect the VPN again and then disconnect the VPN before setting up something in the smart home. And the apps don't even work in the background because the VPN won't be connected.\n\nHonestly, if I was alone, I would go for the VPN option, but this is not applicable in my situation in my home.

I am (hopefully) able to learn new things. I'll set up anything you suggest. I will try to go through any thorny process. All I'd like to get is relatively secure access to my services without switching a VPN on, off, on, off...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sincerely appreciate any ideas. You maby won't believe it, but I've been reading the internet for many months, almost half a year. I'm buying Rasperry Pis, Intel NUCs, experimenting... This is the last hope for help/idea. Please spread this Reddit, I would be quite interested in what, for example, experts in the field would advise.

Although as of now it lacks many features which will be added soon in futures release cycles but right now we have got everything stabilized and are nearing to our first release `v1.0.0`. So I would like to have some feedbacks on my project because they are really valuable part for this project.\n\nIn the next part I share the reason this project exists and what we have done so far, share the goal of the project and what we are planning to do in the future.\n\n## Why does it exist?\n\nThe primary purpose of the `Websurfx` project is to create a fast, secure, and privacy-focused metasearch engine. While there are numerous metasearch engines available, not all of them guarantee the security of their search engine, which is critical for maintaining privacy. Memory flaws, for example, can expose private or sensitive information, which is never a good thing. Also, there is the added problem of Spam, ads, and unorganic results which most engines don't have the full-proof answer to it till now. Moreover, Rust is used to write Websurfx, which ensures memory safety and removes such issues. Many metasearch engines also lack important features like advanced picture search, which is required by many graphic designers, content providers, and others. Websurfx attempts to improve the user experience by providing these and other features, such as providing custom filtering ability and Micro-apps or Quick results (like providing a calculator, currency exchanges, etc. in the search results).\n\n## Preview\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Home Page](https://preview.redd.it/feez516sc9nb1.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c2cf0ec26f3a7da2aa644a5746bc027fbbc1719)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Search Page](https://preview.redd.it/d5y0s9htc9nb1.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca9f3f5a46068df8751164a4e0b05421a7a7c2d5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[404 page](https://preview.redd.it/8hjtk9yuc9nb1.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c5d726f2556f40c5eb7f04e8cbb8c88d6d8641)\n\n## What Do We Provide Right Now?\n\n* Ad-Free Results.\n* 12 colorschemes and a `simple` theme by default.\n* Ability to filter content using filter lists (coming soon).\n* Speed, Privacy, and Security.\n\n## In Future Releases\n\nWe are planning to move to `leptos` framework, which will help us provide more privacy by providing feature based compilation which allows the user to choose between different privacy levels. Which will look something like this:\n\n* `Default:` It will use `wasm` and `js` with `csr` and `ssr`.\n* `Harderned:` It will use `ssr` only with some `js`\n* `Harderned-with-no-scripts:` It will use `ssr` only with no `js` at all.\n\n## Goals\n\n* Organic and Relevant Results\n* Ad-Free and Spam-Free Results\n* Advanced Image Search (providing searches based on color, size, etc.)\n* Dorking Support (in other words advanced search query syntax like using And, not and or in search queries)\n* Privacy, Security, and Speed.\n* Support for low memory devices (like you will be able to host websurfx on low memory devices like phones, tablets, etc.).\n* Quick Results and Micro-Apps (providing quick apps like calculator, and exchange in the search results).\n* AI Integration for Answering Search Queries.\n* High Level of Customizability (providing more colorschemes and themes).\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nWell, I will not compare my benchmark to other metasearch engines and Searx, but here is the benchmark for speed.\n\n    Number of workers/users: 16\n    Number of searches per worker/user: 1\n    Total time: 75.37s\n    Average time per search: 4.71s\n    Minimum time: 2.95s\n    Maximum time: 9.28s\n\n**Note:** This benchmark was performed on a 1 Mbps internet connection speed.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started, clone the repository, edit the config file, which is located in the `websurfx` directory, and install the Redis server by following the instructions located here. Then run the `websurfx` server and Redis server using the following commands.\n\n    git clone https://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx.git\n    cd websurfx\n    cargo build -r\n    redis-server --port 8082 &amp;amp;\n    ./target/debug/websurfx\n\nOnce you have started the server, open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to start using Websurfx.\n\nCheck out the [docs](https://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx/blob/rolling/docs/installation.md) for docker deployment and more installation instructions.\n\n**Call to Action:** If you like the project then I would suggest leaving a star on the project as this helps us reach more people in the process.\n\n**Project Link:**\n\n[https://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx](https://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx)",

I've spent many, many obsessive hours trying to put together the best performing, lowest wattage server I could create, that has practicality.  I've already purchased parts so this is what I'm assembling.\n\n- AS Rock B460 itx motherboard in a Silverstone Sugo SG13 case\n\n- 32GB DDR4 2666 Samsung ECC server memory (one slot open with option to upgrade to 64GB)\n\n- i3 10100T low power CPU\n\n- Starting with one Western Digital Red 18TB, will have room for three more (modded the case with a four drive cage with a 120mm low speed fan for cooling). Plans for RAID 5 (I know...) or Raid 10 later.  Not sure yet of the best way (snapraid?) to implement that with software.  Don't have much experience with that.   \n\n- Silverstone 300w SFX PSU Bronze, in SFX &gt; ATX bracket to allow for slightly taller CPU cooler (81mm).  PSU calculators all put me at max 200w with the case fully loaded worse case scenario.  This is the most efficient PSU wattage amount to draw the least amount of power, whether at 20% or 70%.  Gold PSU was hard to find and not worth the cost.  \n\n- Noctua NH-L12S cooler.  Overkill for the 35w CPU on purpose, it fits, and it will basically be almost passive to save on wattage.  Almost no fan needed.  \n\n- 512gb nvme for OS/apps\n\nTotal power draw will be idle at around 18-35 watts.  This should be actually possible according to my deep research on this.  This should be achievable with the specs above and perhaps undervolting the CPU a tad and optimizing everything.  Will confirm with 'Kill-a-watt' device.  With four drives, idle should be around 60 watts.  The cost to run, per year, should be $45-$80 to start.  \n\n- Fiber internet with 1300 down, 900 up\n\n- Gigabit ethernet port...it really doesn't matter that I won't get full down speeds...I mean, no VPN will provide that anyway\n\n- AirVPN\n\nI don't know what OS to choose.  I am busy with life at the moment.  I am mildly Linux literate and use it as a daily on a laptop....but I'm no pro.  My thoughts are, just to start, to install Windows 10, Transmission as the torrent client (allows for thousands of torrents, right?), and then Docker, Glueten, AirVPN.  Enable remote access in transmission, basically have a seedbox on my local network I can access elsewhere at home.  \n\nI want to keep it in my closet with my router, direct ethernet connection of course, so I also need a freeware VNC solution so I can see it and play around with it from my main PC in another room.  Configure and have access to it remotely on local network.  Everything is wired ethernet of course.  Only gigabit for this server, but perhaps I would benefit putting in a 2.5gbe nic like my main PC so at least they could connect to each other at that higher rate locally.  IDK if that's worth it.  \n\nI believe this setup should work well to get started.  This is in addition to my paid seedbox.  I need something with tons of storage and another seedbox is too pricey.  \n\nMy concerns at this point are:\n\n- Security.  Will this thing be safe from outside threats?  Likely I need to work on that aspect.\n\n- Stability.  Is this a reasonably stable setup to run 24/7?  If my power ever goes out, will it be easy to restart and keep going?  Should be...just a windows PC with a torrent client basically.  \n\n- Speeds.  VPN is the limiting factor here.  Hope I can do OK with wireguard...the 10th gen CPU has the power, but VPNs just aren't serving gigabit internet customers too well yet.  \n\nI know Linux would be better.  My main concern is getting this going easily, and having the best compatibility with VPN clients, Air VPN in particular.  I know the terminal fairly well, but I have not ever set up a VPN in the terminal and don't really want to learn right now if I don't have to.  I'm slammed at work right now.  I am not against switching to Linux later, but for the forseeable future, I'd like to start with windows.  But I worry about raid options.  If I did Linux, it would be Ubuntu.  Maybe Fedora as I'm familiar with it.  No other distro.  It needs to have good documentation and a large user base/community.  \n\nWindows has it's drawbacks, but it has a UI that's ok and works.  And the VPN providers favor that platform.  Everyone does.  \n\nIf anyone has any input, I'd be glad to hear it and take that advice.\n\nSelf-hosting is hard!

Almost no fan needed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;512gb nvme for OS/apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total power draw will be idle at around 18-35 watts.  This should be actually possible according to my deep research on this.  This should be achievable with the specs above and perhaps undervolting the CPU a tad and optimizing everything.  Will confirm with &amp;#39;Kill-a-watt&amp;#39; device.  With four drives, idle should be around 60 watts.  The cost to run, per year, should be $45-$80 to start.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber internet with 1300 down, 900 up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gigabit ethernet port...it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter that I won&amp;#39;t get full down speeds...I mean, no VPN will provide that anyway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AirVPN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what OS to choose.  I am busy with life at the moment.  I am mildly Linux literate and use it as a daily on a laptop....but I&amp;#39;m no pro.  My thoughts are, just to start, to install Windows 10, Transmission as the torrent client (allows for thousands of torrents, right?), and then Docker, Glueten, AirVPN.  Enable remote access in transmission, basically have a seedbox on my local network I can access elsewhere at home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to keep it in my closet with my router, direct ethernet connection of course, so I also need a freeware VNC solution so I can see it and play around with it from my main PC in another room.  Configure and have access to it remotely on local network.  Everything is wired ethernet of course.  Only gigabit for this server, but perhaps I would benefit putting in a 2.5gbe nic like my main PC so at least they could connect to each other at that higher rate locally.  IDK if that&amp;#39;s worth it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this setup should work well to get started.  This is in addition to my paid seedbox.  I need something with tons of storage and another seedbox is too pricey.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My concerns at this point are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security.  Will this thing be safe from outside threats?  Likely I need to work on that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stability.  Is this a reasonably stable setup to run 24/7?  If my power ever goes out, will it be easy to restart and keep going?  Should be...just a windows PC with a torrent client basically.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speeds.  VPN is the limiting factor here.  Hope I can do OK with wireguard...the 10th gen CPU has the power, but VPNs just aren&amp;#39;t serving gigabit internet customers too well yet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know Linux would be better.  My main concern is getting this going easily, and having the best compatibility with VPN clients, Air VPN in particular.  I know the terminal fairly well, but I have not ever set up a VPN in the terminal and don&amp;#39;t really want to learn right now if I don&amp;#39;t have to.  I&amp;#39;m slammed at work right now.  I am not against switching to Linux later, but for the forseeable future, I&amp;#39;d like to start with windows.  But I worry about raid options.  If I did Linux, it would be Ubuntu.  Maybe Fedora as I&amp;#39;m familiar with it.  No other distro.  It needs to have good documentation and a large user base/community.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Windows has it&amp;#39;s drawbacks, but it has a UI that&amp;#39;s ok and works.  And the VPN providers favor that platform.  Everyone does.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any input, I&amp;#39;d be glad to hear it and take that advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self-hosting is hard!  I hope it&amp;#39;s rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "82508a80-05bc-11eb-ae09-0effb713859f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "16eudn2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GrandyRetroCandy", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/16eudn2/any_tips_for_running_a_secure_and_stable_seedbox/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/16eudn2/any_tips_for_running_a_secure_and_stable_seedbox/", "subreddit_subscribers": 274257, "created_utc": 1694332572.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "I've just installed podgrab using the native linux installer.
