Since I was planning to learn how to code this summer, I bought this book to use it when I had the basics under control.\n\nBy the time late july had set I knew the basics of python and the book didi not ask more than that, \"*Since the book explains most concepts from the ground up, basic proficiency in Python is all you need. \"* on the author's own words. I started reading the book around that time and to be completely honest; my opinion from it was at the highest before reading and it only went downwards the more I advanced with it.\n\nThe first chapters consist of the basics of time series data (Barely any depth) followed by some preprocessing steps in which the author tries to teach the basics of missing value handling and visualization of the components of the data, ending the first section by exposing some of the classical models. All of this was done in 105 pages! \n\nThe next section of this book exposes machine learning concepts for time series; this is where the two main problems I have with this book start to become apparent:\n\n1- The explanations are very concise; which for complex subjects such as the ones the book covers it really becomes a problem.\n\n2- The book uses an excessive amount of custom functions and classes by the author.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.1 The book is way too short for the amount of content it pretends to teach.**\n\nFirst things first; *how long* is the book? \n\nWhile in Packt's website and Amazon the book is said to be 552 pages long, the actual content of the printed copy I have is 505 pages; for 40\u20ac/$ this seems like a pretty nice deal; the problem is that if you look at the sheer amount of stuff this contains; it looks too good to be true; it is. The way so much content is compressed into the book is by cutting off a lot of the meat of what it is trying to teach; this is why I say that the book exposes you to a lot of concepts but fails to teach them to you; 500 pages is not enough for a book that teaches you basic analysis, ML and DL from the ground up, But how egregious can this be? There is only a single 28 pages long chapter for classical statistical models; the explanation for ARIMA is two pages long; this is how bad it gets. You could say that this book is specialized in ML and DL and you would be correct in that statement but the ML part is 154 pages long and the DL one is 194; it's simply too short with its explanations and it makes the book outright frustrating to follow once you reach the Deep Learning section. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.2 The book has an identity crisis regarding the group it's marketed towards.**\n\nIn the amazon page, it says that the book is directed towards Data Scientists but that everything is explained from the ground up so only the basics of Python Programming are strictly needed even though knowledge of ML would help.\n\nOk, so what is it? I can tell you that the book is overwhelming for beginners; not because the models are explained at their full complexity but because it is done way too fast. Is it for experienced data workers who want to learn time series? Well, you've got some pages dedicated to basic pandas commandas and ML and DL are \"taught\" from the ground up while almost totally neglecting the classical models and any kind of inference so not really. The amazon page says ML knowledge is is recommended and I'd say that maybe if you've reached that point then you may understand the book but for beginners it's simply inaccesible.\n\nIt's not just ML though; the book uses Plotly for visualizations; If you know basic python you will most likely go the matplotlib route and showing plotly code without explaining it is a decision that shows even more how this book simply is not for beginners.\n\nThe book just explains badly; I am taking the edX MIT Machine Learning Course and while it is more complex; it is perfectly understandable; this book just half-explains stuff and while people who know what they are doing may be able to cope with it, I get the feeling that if you understand the concepts the book is teaching then it may be because you have already moved past them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. The unbearable custom code**\n\nUp to here I could maybe understand that the explanations simply weren't from me and the book may be better under other people's eyes but it is not the explanations that I find severely short and lacking the largest problem I have with this book; it is the code it uses.\n\nRight from the first  coding chapter the author uses custom functions and classes and it is extremely frustrating. To deal with time series in ML the author uses his own code and while it may be more comfortable, you have to know how to use it and there lies a huge problem; the functions and classes DO NOT have docstrings and because the author does not explain them properly in the book, you have to go to the function definitions to get a sense of what each component is doing. This is simply unbearable and if you do not already know ML and DL, this just adds another layer of abstraction which will make a complex part even more difficult to understand.\n\nIt is not only that they are not properly documented but they are not implemented onto a package; it despite all you still try to persevere and make real world usage of this book you will have to copy the full src folder in each folder you are going to make use of the material. The author claims that after finishing the book you are going tobe able to *\"build world-class time series forecasting systems\",* But how though? Is the author really saying that you are going to need to make a package out of HIS code to make it usable?

Since I was planning to learn how to code this summer, I bought this book to use it when I had the basics under control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time late july had set I knew the basics of python and the book didi not ask more than that, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Since the book explains most concepts from the ground up, basic proficiency in Python is all you need. &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; on the author&amp;#39;s own words. I started reading the book around that time and to be completely honest; my opinion from it was at the highest before reading and it only went downwards the more I advanced with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first chapters consist of the basics of time series data (Barely any depth) followed by some preprocessing steps in which the author tries to teach the basics of missing value handling and visualization of the components of the data, ending the first section by exposing some of the classical models. All of this was done in 105 pages! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next section of this book exposes machine learning concepts for time series; this is where the two main problems I have with this book start to become apparent:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- The explanations are very concise; which for complex subjects such as the ones the book covers it really becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- The book uses an excessive amount of custom functions and classes by the author.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 The book is way too short for the amount of content it pretends to teach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First things first; &lt;em&gt;how long&lt;/em&gt; is the book? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in Packt&amp;#39;s website and Amazon the book is said to be 552 pages long, the actual content of the printed copy I have is 505 pages; for 40\u20ac/$ this seems like a pretty nice deal; the problem is that if you look at the sheer amount of stuff this contains; it looks too good to be true; it is. The way so much content is compressed into the book is by cutting off a lot of the meat of what it is trying to teach; this is why I say that the book exposes you to a lot of concepts but fails to teach them to you; 500 pages is not enough for a book that teaches you basic analysis, ML and DL from the ground up, But how egregious can this be? There is only a single 28 pages long chapter for classical statistical models; the explanation for ARIMA is two pages long; this is how bad it gets. You could say that this book is specialized in ML and DL and you would be correct in that statement but the ML part is 154 pages long and the DL one is 194; it&amp;#39;s simply too short with its explanations and it makes the book outright frustrating to follow once you reach the Deep Learning section. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 The book has an identity crisis regarding the group it&amp;#39;s marketed towards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the amazon page, it says that the book is directed towards Data Scientists but that everything is explained from the ground up so only the basics of Python Programming are strictly needed even though knowledge of ML would help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what is it? I can tell you that the book is overwhelming for beginners; not because the models are explained at their full complexity but because it is done way too fast. Is it for experienced data workers who want to learn time series? Well, you&amp;#39;ve got some pages dedicated to basic pandas commandas and ML and DL are &amp;quot;taught&amp;quot; from the ground up while almost totally neglecting the classical models and any kind of inference so not really. The amazon page says ML knowledge is is recommended and I&amp;#39;d say that maybe if you&amp;#39;ve reached that point then you may understand the book but for beginners it&amp;#39;s simply inaccesible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just ML though; the book uses Plotly for visualizations; If you know basic python you will most likely go the matplotlib route and showing plotly code without explaining it is a decision that shows even more how this book simply is not for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The book just explains badly; I am taking the edX MIT Machine Learning Course and while it is more complex; it is perfectly understandable; this book just half-explains stuff and while people who know what they are doing may be able to cope with it, I get the feeling that if you understand the concepts the book is teaching then it may be because you have already moved past them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The unbearable custom code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up to here I could maybe understand that the explanations simply weren&amp;#39;t from me and the book may be better under other people&amp;#39;s eyes but it is not the explanations that I find severely short and lacking the largest problem I have with this book; it is the code it uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right from the first  coding chapter the author uses custom functions and classes and it is extremely frustrating. To deal with time series in ML the author uses his own code and while it may be more comfortable, you have to know how to use it and there lies a huge problem; the functions and classes DO NOT have docstrings and because the author does not explain them properly in the book, you have to go to the function definitions to get a sense of what each component is doing. This is simply unbearable and if you do not already know ML and DL, this just adds another layer of abstraction which will make a complex part even more difficult to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not only that they are not properly documented but they are not implemented onto a package; it despite all you still try to persevere and make real world usage of this book you will have to copy the full src folder in each folder you are going to make use of the material. The author claims that after finishing the book you are going tobe able to &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;build world-class time series forecasting systems&amp;quot;,&lt;/em&gt; But how though? Is the author really saying that you are going to need to make a package out of HIS code to make it usable? This is for me the ultimate dealbreaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my first contact with Machine Learning and I can tell you that It&amp;#39;s hard to think there could be a worse introduction than this.
