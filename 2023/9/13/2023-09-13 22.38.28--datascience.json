This company is often in the news for donating to far right political groups, donating money to support racial propaganda or suppression of specific groups of people. Why should a large company be donating money so certain groups of people have more difficulty getting out to vote, or trying to redraw political lines? \n\n- Lazy/incompetent leaders. My boss would often schedule meetings and show up 10 to 15 minutes late, or they are driving in their car, never at their desk during business hours. How are you leading a team and you're never working during actual business hours? It was a mystery to me how they got away with doing that for so long while the rest of us work hard around the clock. \n\n- Incompetent and outdated culture. We posted a business analyst position and made it clear we were looking for someone comfortable in Excel, SQL, and BigQuery. They transferred someone internally who looked good on paper. But they would hit me up daily asking basic questions about Excel. I had to explain to them what a Vlookup was and how to use it on a weekly basis. They had no interest in researching or learning anything on their own. The IT and Engineering department was filled with software developers who barely understood how to code at all. Had someone ask me \"what is version control/git and why should I be learning that?\"\n\n\n- Hustle culture with no reward for excelling. Programmers are measured not by the quality of their work, but by the number of lines of code that they write. No, seriously. I was very familiar with many of the engineers, and they were literally measured on how many lines of code they were producing, and it was expected that they are at their desk 90% of the day. You're not allowed to get up and go for a walk to get some fresh air, No socializing with others, have to be at your desk throughout your working hours or you are considered lazy. When it comes time for the annual review, you're going to get a 1-2% \"raise\" No matter how hard you work. I was told it's near impossible to get an actual raise over 3% unless you did something game-changing like saved the company tens of millions of dollars then you'll get like 5% if you're lucky. People also have a habit of working outside their working hours. I would get emails all the time well after 6:00 p.m., but people are not getting paid for those extra hours....\n\n\n- MANDATORY EXTRACURRICULAR EVENTS. There are certain times as a remote worker you have to go to team outings or do something \"fun\". For example, going to a local park to play baseball or soccer with the rest of your department. Our manager was conveniently 45 minutes late so we had to start without them, they showed up and did one thing and then sat on the bench the entire time watching us. Being forced to participate in extracurricular activities with other employees that management doesn't even participate in. Makes you feel like a servant\n\n\n\n- Layoffs are frequent, and you're treated like a piece of garbage. They laid off several dozen people including myself, and each of them were treated like external employees going forward. could not apply to new jobs as internal applicant, had to follow the external applicant process and be grouped in with everyone else, and treated like I was some stranger they had never met before even though I had worked for the company for two and a half years and had glowing reviews, even included several formal written letters of recognition from leadership where I was recognized... No one cared. They are constantly laying people off each year, doing restructures, but there's no purpose for it. Just shuffling around people like cards with no real strategic goal\n\n\n\n- The hiring process is unfair. I applied for another position after I was laid off that I was 100% qualified for, and didn't get an interview for this one position even though I interviewed for several others. When I asked the recruiter what the deal was, they said an internal employee transferred into that role. So I was passed up for the interview, not even considered for the position, they just let someone else take the job without even letting me interview for it which is extremely shady and unfair. \n\n\n- The recruiting and talent teams are terrible. Not only do they not understand The basics of technical recruiting, they couldn't be bothered to care because they are all shuffled around all the time since talent acquisition is constantly being laid off. They just laid off a huge number of their HR and talent acquisition personnel so the ones that are now doing technical recruiting don't understand the basics of what they are even recruiting for. Applied for a data science role and informed them I had experience with Natural language processing, regression, training and calibrating machine learning models, Jupyter notebooks, writing APIs, using Hadoop, Spark/PySpark. Their response? \"Sorry, we're looking for someone with a little bit more of data science experience, that sounds more along the lines of an analyst.\" I was stunned. \n\n\nHonestly, would not recommend Home Depot", "author_fullname": "t2_hdeet8zsc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "One company you should never work for: Home Depot", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_16hw3lu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 110, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 110, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1694632794.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a data professional with several years of experience in data science and analytics, and wanted to share a company that I would never recommend working for based on my intimate knowledge of 5+ years of experience here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boomer run company with a long history of being run by old white men that are completely out of touch with reality.
