The program was to get hands on experience at a company before they went to school so they could decide a career path with more information on what the day to day is like in the workplace.\n\nWhen I met this student, he informed me the program randomly placed the kids into jobs blindly. He had no idea what I did or what he was going to do. When I told him I am a data scientist, he was not happy and had no interest at all. He was hoping for a sales or marketing placement as that is more interesting to him.\n\nThe first week did not go well at all. He was very disinterested and vocal about it. So at the end of the week we did our required weekly progress report and I just begged him to give it a chance, because if he did poorly, we\u2019re both going to look bad. \n\nOver the course of the 4 months he was with me, we spent afternoons completing complex problems, learning various programs, and making key business decisions using data driven decision making. I taught him SQL, R, Python, and power bi-automate. The kid was a natural.

So much so that when he graduated this summer, he decided that he chose his college major (computer science &amp; statistics) because of how gratifying the work we did was and how interested in data he became during our time. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, I bawled like a baby.

As I start this journey, I find myself facing  challenges, both technical and psychological (hello, imposter  syndrome!).\n\n**Background:**\n\n* My company primarily operates outside the health or finance sectors.\n* My role demands collaboration with various departments, ranging from designing experiments to analyzing data for actionable insights.\n* While the company does have a dedicated data science team, their main focus is finance and market data.\n* My predecessors primarily relied on orthogonal design matrices, ANOVA, and regression.\n* In the coming years, there are plans to expand our team and develop specialized tools for other departments, encompassing ML models and visualization dashboards.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n1. **Establishing Best Practices**: I've been entrusted with setting up systems for version control, documentation, training, and visualization.\n2. **End-to-End ML Applications**: I'm well-acquainted with Python and ML basics but lack experience in end-to-end ML applications.\n3. **Cloud Platforms**: I've yet to understand platforms like Azure or AWS, both of which seem integral to my role.\n\nBased on this my questions are as follows:\n\n1. How can I gain a deep understanding of cloud platforms?\n2. Would certifications be beneficial, or are online courses sufficient?\n3. If online courses are recommended, which specific topics or courses would you suggest?\n4. What skills are pivotal for creating and deploying ML applications?\n5. I'd appreciate personal anecdotes or experiences that shaped your ML journey.\n\nTime and resources are on my side, so I'm open to intensive learning paths. I genuinely appreciate any advice or insights you can offer.

How did they compare to one another in terms of ease-of-use, available examples / documentation, flexibility, built-in functionality, and necessary maintenance?\n\n\\- Is one set of packages better suited for one task than the other? E.g., TF has stronger Bayesian packaging and PyTorch has stronger gnn / geometric packaging.\n\n\\- Are there glaring pitfalls of using one set of packages over another?\n\nFurther Background:\n\n\\- Our data comes in the form of both tabular data (numeric and categorical) as well as social networks.\n\n\\- Computational expense is not an issue, we work in an industry that requires business day holds on all applications to allow for thorough investigation.\n\nThanks so much :)", "author_fullname": "t2_jmypsx5wq", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "TensorFlow (tensorflow-probability &amp; tensorflow-gnn) and PyTorch (torch_geometric &amp; pyro-ppl) in Fraud Detection", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_16hqkvj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1694620164.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was recently hired at a small company that handles quite a lot of internet applications for much larger companies, and as part of that we screen the applications for fraudulent actors. Our upper management (who is great and very flexible with the data team) has asked us to look into upgrading the current fraud model that we have (essentially a logistic regression put in place by some consultants a decade ago) into something neural net based. While I have a lot of math experience (I have a PhD in applied mathematics), I don&amp;#39;t have much experience in deep learning and would appreciate a bit of advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After talking with management, we decided to explore Bayesian Neural Nets (with uncertainty in both parameter and output estimation) and Graph Neural Nets. They&amp;#39;ve more-or-less left it to me as a research project and are very happy to listen to our team&amp;#39;s suggestions. I&amp;#39;ve spent a fair chunk of time now playing around with the APIs from the TensorFlow universe (tensorflow-probability, tensorflow-gnn) as well as ones from the PyTorch universe (torch_geometric, pyro), but do not have the experience yet in this specific domain to pick out discernable differences and how they will impact the engineering and future maintenance of such a model. So, I figured I&amp;#39;d stop lurking and ask the sub a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Do you have experiences / preferences with and between these packages? How did they compare to one another in terms of ease-of-use, available examples / documentation, flexibility, built-in functionality, and necessary maintenance?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Is one set of packages better suited for one task than the other? E.g., TF has stronger Bayesian packaging and PyTorch has stronger gnn / geometric packaging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Are there glaring pitfalls of using one set of packages over another?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further Background:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Our data comes in the form of both tabular data (numeric and categorical) as well as social networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Computational expense is not an issue, we work in an industry that requires business day holds on all applications to allow for thorough investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "16hqkvj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nn_lurker_question", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/16hqkvj/tensorflow_tensorflowprobability_tensorflowgnn/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16hqkvj/tensorflow_tensorflowprobability_tensorflowgnn/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1044130, "created_utc": 1694620164.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
