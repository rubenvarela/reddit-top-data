Every program comes with pros and cons, of course, and I&amp;#39;m weighing them based on flexibility (e.g. part-time option to keep working full-time), affordability, and career/job assistance. Also, the current market and mass of layoffs are making me concerned and doubtful of my decision. Any advice on navigating this career transition?
