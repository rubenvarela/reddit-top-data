When I got here, we were about to lose all dashboarding capability, so I learned Python, Dash, HiveQL/SQL, and started cranking out dashboards. Some of them do dynamics and statistics calcs on the back end, and some are just straight up data tables from live hive queries to relay small datasets.  I also do a little bit of non-ML algorithm development and the occasional data pipeline. I analyze the data too and make suggestions based on it. \n\n\nThere\u2019s no changing job titles or billets where I work.

Labwork consists of 5 parts and part one is to do an input data analysis, do some descriptive summary statistics, do some plots, make a few manipulations to the data where needed. So descriptive summary statistics part requires me to do a specific data quality report, more specifically it asks me to provide [count, missing_value_%, mode, mode_freq, mode_%, 2nd_mode, 2nd_mode_freq, 2nd_mode_%] for categorical features. \n\nSo as just a default pd.describe() was not enough for it, i did the whole thing manually using .agg() and combining default aggregation functions with my custom functions. This is where I got stuck.\n\nI spent the whole day trying to write a function that would calculate the modes for me and would work together with other functions inside .agg(). In the end I failed and just decided to do a separate mode dataframe that I later just concatenate to the output of df.agg(). \n\nHow do I actually learn all these technical and trivial stuff? Manipulating dataframes, series, permuting them the way I want (also, the same applies to all other \u201csmall stuff\u201d in coding - manipulating strings, lists/dicts, applying functions to dataframes and so on)?

Labwork consists of 5 parts and part one is to do an input data analysis, do some descriptive summary statistics, do some plots, make a few manipulations to the data where needed. So descriptive summary statistics part requires me to do a specific data quality report, more specifically it asks me to provide [count, missing&lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;%, mode, mode&lt;em&gt;freq, mode&lt;/em&gt;%, 2nd&lt;em&gt;mode, 2nd_mode_freq, 2nd_mode&lt;/em&gt;%] for categorical features. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as just a default pd.describe() was not enough for it, i did the whole thing manually using .agg() and combining default aggregation functions with my custom functions. This is where I got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the whole day trying to write a function that would calculate the modes for me and would work together with other functions inside .agg().

Yet in the wild I see a lot of production pipelines which are completely written in pandas. \n\nSame issue in the team I just joined. Tons of pandas code which we cannot update anymore because even a minor version update could break everything.\n\nAnother issue I see is that these pipelines are build without any regard to encapsulation or abstraction. Everything is just glued together directly. But they have the same issue any software system has and why the concept of microservices are a thing in software development for years. Any change is a huge mess because these pipelines are big monoliths.\n\nSo I guess my questions are: How do you build your production pipelines? Is it normal to use pandas in those pipelines? Do you have any issues with it?

Yet in the wild I see a lot of production pipelines which are completely written in pandas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same issue in the team I just joined. Tons of pandas code which we cannot update anymore because even a minor version update could break everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another issue I see is that these pipelines are build without any regard to encapsulation or abstraction. Everything is just glued together directly. But they have the same issue any software system has and why the concept of microservices are a thing in software development for years. Any change is a huge mess because these pipelines are big monoliths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess my questions are: How do you build your production pipelines?
