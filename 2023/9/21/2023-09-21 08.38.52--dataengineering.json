I remember what it was like during 2008 because I graduated m during the Great Recession. I started white collar work at 28 and came into it with more wisdom than most because it was a rough 5 years til 2013 when I started in actuarial consulting. \n\nNo where on my resume does my title say \"Data Engineer. From 2013-2023\n\n* Retail Store manager\n\n* Actuarial Consultant\n\n* Data Scientist\n\n* Data Science Consultant\n\n* Senior Specialist\n\n* Solutions Architect\n\n* Lead Data Operations Engineer\n\nI have 4 bachelors (doubled majored twice) in Econ, Business Management, statistics, and psychology. I like to learn and that's one reason I like the backend part of data work: it has the more impressive technology that will be fundamental to data platforms in the future: Infra as code, CI/CD, etc. A well oiled and scalable pipeline that is fully automated and predictable brings a tear to my eye. It's similar to solving a tough math problem: dopamine. \n\nMy main point here is that titles are meaningless. There are so many out there that slightly differ with inconsistent job descriptions that a lot of people count themselves out and dont apply. Let me be the first to say: most companies dont know what they need. \n\nThe global economy gives me 2008 vibes. I think a crash is imminent and it will hit tech the hardest once the Megacaps crash. Layoffs were tested in March 2023 and we are about to enter annual budgeting season where more will come. Meanwhile the underlying tech companies are burning through cash and have no long term plan: they will not exist in 3 years. \n\nWe have been living in a Zero Interest Rate Policy (Zirp) since 2009, which means corporate loans, debt, and bailouts were essentially free. In Sept2019, there was a major liquidity crisis among banks, 2020 had covid bail outs, 2020-21 80% of all US dollars were printed, and now we have high inflation AND high rates: a first. No AI model will save you from that. \n\nWith all that being said, the market is a lot more competitive and complex than 2015-2021. Higher rates mean PE Firms and VC can go elsewhere to get risk free rates at 6%. Not many tech companies can promise the 30% gains anymore because they are also losing their clients who are rebalancing their portfolios to weather the storm. There will be a lot less money flowing into tech. \n\nI say this because I'm seeing a lot of candidates that refuse to take a $5k-$10k pay cut and complaining they can't find a job that will pay them. I'm seeing companies that did mass layoffs in March, now hire same roles 20% lower pay. 2020-21 were the peak for now. When you join a new company, you have to rebuild your reputation anyways, it will lead to higher raises at the right company and you'll come out ahead. \n\nIt's highly competitive and there's a lot of good talent not getting the right eyes on them. This is because companies gutted their recruiting divisions and are relying on \"AI\". \n\nIt used to be a good resume gets you an interview and a good interview gets you the job. Now it's a struggle to get past resume parsers that it's almost worth paying someone to do it for you (Linkedin makes a good resume from your profile). \n\nI recently switched jobs and am starting my new role aoon. I took a 10% paycut, but am up 50% since leaving my second consultancy in 2022. Been a rough few years lol. I applied to 250 on Indeed and LinkedIn and received the same canned replies with different names. Some right as I clicked apply. Humans werent even seeing my resume. \n\nAfter a week of being on LinkedIn with 0 connections, I got 2 recruiters that I can tell looked at my profile: one another consultancy and one a product company I consider recession resistent. I swore off consulting (and databricks) so I put all my energy into the other company and signed the offer a week ago after 2 weeks since first message with recruiter. \n\nCurrent State of the market: rough, but not impossible. Lots of demand for back end of the data pipelines (devops, infra as code, ci/cd, data engineering). Moreso than DS and BI. \n\nI'd advise anyone to focus on learning more of those skillsets, being platform agnostic as possible. Don't chase badges: learning style doesnt warrant long term memory benefits. It's much better to learn by doing. Assume Chatgpt and YT dont exist and figure out something on your own. Set it up in git, follow proper branching techniques, implement CI/CD and work toward something that can be deployed and used by others. Container services like Docker are useful places to deploy code. What about Kubernetes. Whats a K8, helm chart, and why do old people hate microservices and young people love it? Lots of questions out there begging to be answered and communicated. \n\nTheres also a significant push toward distributed computing, especially the platforms we all love and hate. They all work similarly under the hood. Take time to understand how they work and how they differ. Dont even need to touch code for that. Grab the book \"Designing Data Intenstive Applications\" cross out the title, and write Bible. Then read it. Then read it again and highlight and take time to process it. Then go see how Spark works and compare the similarities. \n\nA lot of the job is knowing the right tools. Yes you can paint a deck of your lakehouse. But if you use the wrong paint, it will destroy the wood in a couple years. Same comes with sticker shock of the platforms we all love and hate. Not everthing needs distributed computing. Not everything needs cloud (believe it or not). Not everything needs AI. But everything has data that needs to go somewhere. \n\nIt used to be depth over breadth. You do real good at one thing, get a degree and become a doctor in it , join corporate, get an mba, start your own consultancy. \n\nBut the sheer insane development pace of the past several years has left those people stuck in the holes they dug for themselves. A true engineer has all the tools they need to Macguyver their way out, and tech leaders use their silver tongues to get someone to pull them out (usually an engineer of some sort). \n\nSo use this time of high anxiety to push yourself out of your comfort zone and try something you may fail at.

On this path, a relatively mild change in data requirements might require a full re-extract of all data just to run the transformation step. And we\u2019d be subject to 3rd party API limits. \n- STRONG coupling of app needs and analytics team needs. Right now, analytics teams are hitting the prod DB freely. And plans are to build solutions that support both, vs separate solutions that support each. \n- No concern or plan for data quality in the re-architecture\n\nThe way I see it i could\n\n- Be the squeaky wheel on all fronts.

This one is debatable but as someone who\u2019s done both my judgement is that this should be a case of ELT and should be done in the DWH.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;STRONG coupling of extraction and transformation. On this path, a relatively mild change in data requirements might require a full re-extract of all data just to run the transformation step. And we\u2019d be subject to 3rd party API limits. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;STRONG coupling of app needs and analytics team needs. Right now, analytics teams are hitting the prod DB freely.

We are working to provide a legit alternative for JVM based tools like Kafka, and Flink based on Rust and WebAssembly.\n\nJVM is the standard and people are used to it, there are many Goliath's in the data platforms space. The smooth stones that the Fluvio project is betting on include the efficiency and performance of Rust, the flexibility and growth trajectory of Web Assembly, the rise of data products, the push for better overall economics of data pipelines, the demand for asynchronous and real time insights.\n\n**Current Project Status:**\n\nIn it's current state with [Fluvio](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio) you can build data pipelines that would offer extreme throughput. You can apply on stream transformations using web assembly (they are called [Fluvio Smart Modules](https://www.fluvio.io/smartmodules/)).\n\nWith delivery guarantees, deduplication, robust caching and mirroring the project has matured significantly in 2023.\n\nThe project supports at least once, at most once, exactly once delivery semantic that can be configured.\n\nThe cloud install is a single binary that is less than 150 MB and the edge version is a 15 MB binary can be deployed on ARMv7 devices with as low as 256 MB memory. Needless to say that it is lightweight.\n\nWith this tiny footprint user tests show 5X throughput along with 10X less CPU utilization and 50X less memory utilization with some of our active installs.\n\n[Fluvio Connectors](https://www.fluvio.io/connectors/) connect at protocol level to http endpoints, BLOB stores, databases, application APIs using supported Rust, Python, Node client, or write to a webhook gateway for polling type applications.\n\nWith smart modules you can currently do unbounded transformation operations like JSON to JSON transformation, maps, array maps, RSS to JSON conversion, REGEX operations and more.\n\n**Future improvements:**\n\nThe tradeoff that was made is to front load a bunch of software engineering and design work and build a somewhat over-engineered solution. The project is nearing it's biggest milestone in a couple of months with on stream materialized views using stateful computation on time windows.\n\nThere are a few areas where the project makes deliberate trade-offs:\n\n1. Kubernetes dependency, even our open source project needs K8 and that is something that the community has been asking us to change. This is on the verge of being solved.\n2. Supported languages: Currently the project supports Rust, Python, Node, and there are some requests to support Go that is being shaped.\n3. No support for SQL transformations: This is a big one based on the conversations in this community, while our domain specific language construct is based on YAML and you can express operations that look and feel like SQL in many cases it is still YAML, and if you are needing custom Smart Modules for transformations you can write custom ones using the smart module development kit.\n4. Hybrid deployment to use whatever cloud you'd like - The project is are currently deployed as a cloud native fully managed turn key system on AWS - [InfinyOn Cloud](https://infinyon.cloud/account). There is a gap where folks are looking for a clear separation of control and data plane and run the core platform within their network to maintain data sovereignty, minimize ingress egress over network which is a big cost driver etc. As a workaround we have helm charts to support the deployment on kubernetes and with the completion of the first point above have the ability to support docker compose and other patterns\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Feedback request:**\n\nAppreciate feedback from folks in the community share feedback about the experience that you have building data platforms building event streaming use cases on how our project compares with what you are used to.\n\nThanks in advance for any insights that you share.", "author_fullname": "t2_6pheknqy6", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fluvio OSS[v0.10.15]: Kafka + Flink built using Rust + WASM", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_16nqizp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "9ecf3c88-e787-11ed-957e-de1616aeae13", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Open Source", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1695229377.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git Repo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio\"&gt;Fluvio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is of decent amount of conversation in the community on Rust for Data Engineering.

This is on the verge of being solved.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supported languages: Currently the project supports Rust, Python, Node, and there are some requests to support Go that is being shaped.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No support for SQL transformations: This is a big one based on the conversations in this community, while our domain specific language construct is based on YAML and you can express operations that look and feel like SQL in many cases it is still YAML, and if you are needing custom Smart Modules for transformations you can write custom ones using the smart module development kit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hybrid deployment to use whatever cloud you&amp;#39;d like - The project is are currently deployed as a cloud native fully managed turn key system on AWS - &lt;a href=\"https://infinyon.cloud/account\"&gt;InfinyOn Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. There is a gap where folks are looking for a clear separation of control and data plane and run the core platform within their network to maintain data sovereignty, minimize ingress egress over network which is a big cost driver etc. As a workaround we have helm charts to support the deployment on kubernetes and with the completion of the first point above have the ability to support docker compose and other patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback request:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Appreciate feedback from folks in the community share feedback about the experience that you have building data platforms building event streaming use cases on how our project compares with what you are used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any insights that you share.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qY-yONN-8Li0wA-6WNm8WEh9znIzJg6SH6gI6dSD8xs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=520d6eb9e3127fc61ea12beb6c628a7ac01126bf", "width": 1280, "height": 640}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qY-yONN-8Li0wA-6WNm8WEh9znIzJg6SH6gI6dSD8xs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8b2d34eea58832a825d918f152a82b79af8c434", "width": 108, "height": 54}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qY-yONN-8Li0wA-6WNm8WEh9znIzJg6SH6gI6dSD8xs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a34b16fad6ae4f0d23b0303a670f94a47da06d", "width": 216, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qY-yONN-8Li0wA-6WNm8WEh9znIzJg6SH6gI6dSD8xs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c2b308bc6209a315ab6214f481a64fbbabc748", "width": 320, "height": 160}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qY-yONN-8Li0wA-6WNm8WEh9znIzJg6SH6gI6dSD8xs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d9c8a8d74aff977a447682ab1ec267414c6a446", "width": 640, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qY-yONN-8Li0wA-6WNm8WEh9znIzJg6SH6gI6dSD8xs.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f977101c367113c571ea99c758181058571c0de", "width": 960, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qY-yONN-8Li0wA-6WNm8WEh9znIzJg6SH6gI6dSD8xs.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=870e21320abfa5d890ea9120345d80f67f1970a5", "width": 1080, "height": 540}], "variants": {}, "id": "whUAUNos2msWHtiLmyar3aMQwJS9FMcp7R_jyGXzp-s"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "3957ca64-3440-11ed-8329-2aa6ad243a59", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Product Manager - Data Platform ", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#005ba1", "id": "16nqizp", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drc1728", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/16nqizp/fluvio_ossv01015_kafka_flink_built_using_rust_wasm/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16nqizp/fluvio_ossv01015_kafka_flink_built_using_rust_wasm/", "subreddit_subscribers": 129565, "created_utc": 1695229377.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Hey folks, I am looking for your data engineering wisdom.

for our data science and analytics teams on Redshift. The cluster has \\~10 schemas we source data from. I have been following [dbt's recommendation](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging) to build these source tables into our dedicated analytics schema as part of the 'staging' model -- essentially duplicating the tables. This is starting to feel redundant when we could hit the sources directly from intermediate queries as opposed to copying them. Additionally, some of these tables are fairly large (\\~600M records).
