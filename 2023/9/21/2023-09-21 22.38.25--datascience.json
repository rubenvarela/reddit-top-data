analytics specialist on a international team for a fortune 500 company, I got this job because were not a lot of people in data in mexico (I\u00b4m Mexican) 2 years ago and just by having some courses and 6 months experience as a data analyst I landed the job which tbh I was very underqualified for. nevertheless i got the hint of it on a reasonable time and now I\u00b4m a valuable team member even though most of my teammates are so skilled in different areas such as statistcs, programming, SAP, bussines knowledge etc. \n\nHowever, the work-from-home setup is coming to an end, and the office is located in another city. I've always had a dream of living in Europe, and also being an EU citizen, this seems like the perfect time to make that move. I have around two months left in my current job, and I want to specialize further and learn a software that's in high demand within this time frame or take a relevant course. I'd appreciate any recommendations you might have.\n\nHere's a bit about my current skills: I'm proficient in Tableau and Alteryx, reasonably skilled in SQL, and I've taken several Python courses, though I haven't used it professionally yet so I really feel like I don\u00b4t know how to use it. I'm also new to Power BI, but I find it relatively easy to grasp.\n\nWhat do you think would be a good software or skill to focus on for a more specialized role in Europe?

We had an initial pilot of 10 locations which ran for about 6 months which was then followed by a 2nd phase with about 100 which ran for over a year. Now we\u2019re rolling this program out to the rest of the showrooms in a massive 3rd and final phase. There is no consistency in the start dates for this program. Even within the 3 phases there were many different start dates as installation was laborious and time intensive, so you can't simply choose a single date as the split date for a pre/post analysis. The program is effectively a new display setup with a much more streamlined approach to both branded and 3rd party products with the goal being a less confusing / stressful customer experience which leads to less decision paralysis and more sales and sales of higher quality due to the product placement.  \n\nFor the first two phases I was able to create some pre/post revenue analysis within the product categories these displays would impact using basic SQL and T-SQL. I took each location\u2019s install date and used that week as the \u201csplit week\u201d and distilled sales in the pre and post periods down to average revenue per week to create an apples-to-apples way to compare performance regardless of when the locations install date was. I know this is imperfect due to the potential for seasonality to warp results among other things, but I did my best to handle for that in ways I won\u2019t detail here.\n \nThese pre/post results were then compared to the control group (locations not on the pilot) by using the same distinct list of \u201csplit weeks\u201d and generating the same analysis for all locations across all split dates and then creating a weighted average to compare between the control (which had no actual split week due to no install date) and the pilot locations. Over time once enough data accumulated this technique seemed to work well.  \n\nThe issue I have now is a) the 1st and 2nd phases have gone on too long to now do an effective pre/post analysis based on weekly data. Any YoY analysis will likely revert to the mean as well. For the purposes of this analysis, I can just focus on phase 3 if need be, but it would be nice to somehow include the first 2 phases as well.\n \nThe primary issue here is phase 3 simply has too many locations across too many install dates and I think this approach will simply be ineffective. Does anybody have any general concepts or ideas on how to best approach this sort of performance evaluation? I need to look at all the locations as they\u2019re coming onto the new program and measure the changes in revenue before and after, but then somehow compare that to the system of locations who have not yet had their installs completed.
