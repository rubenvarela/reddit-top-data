I've chosen this setup over iCloud and Apple's photo app because I've accumulated about 600GB of memories and I'm concerned about the potential costs and complications that come with cloud storage as my collection continues to grow.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of my current setup:**\n\nStorage and Organisation: I rely on Qfile to download my photos and videos onto the NAS, neatly organised into folders by the year. It's been working reasonably well in terms of keeping things in order.\n\n**Access at Home:** Sharing these memories on our TVs via Plex is easy and makes viewing at home convenient.\n\nHowever, I've encountered a few challenges:\n\nMobile Access: The hitch in my system is accessing these files while I'm away from home. Having to turn on a VPN, wait for it to connect to the QNAP, launch Qumagie, and then wait for all the thumbnails to load can be frustrating. Often, by the time I've gone through all these steps I have just lost interest.\n\n**Video Playback Issues**: The biggest roadblock I face is that I've never been able to get Qumagie to play videos on my phone (or even in my browser). Whenever I try, I receive the message, \"Failed to play. Play this file using transcoding or the native player.\" This is baffling because I'm trying to play videos on my iPhone, the same device I used to record them. I've also upgraded my CAYIN MediaSign Player license to the plus version, which should theoretically support the current iPhone format. However, transcoding remains a mystery to me. I understand the basics, such as matching the video format to the device's capabilities, but I'm stumped as to why this isn't working. It seems that to resolve this, I'd need to transcode all my videos, resulting in duplicate files and extra storage usage on my NAS.\n\nGiven these challenges, I've recently contemplated whether I should bite the bullet and invest in iCloud storage, primarily for the convenience of using Apple's photo applications while relegating the QNAP to backup duty only. This isn't my preferred option, however the Apple app handles photos and videos exceptionally well.\n\nThat said, I'm eager to hear if anyone in the community has discovered clever solutions to address these issues. I'd love to know what methods or apps you're using to streamline the process of managing and accessing photos and videos on your QNAP NAS, especially while on the go.

As my final, final attempt.~~\n\n\n#Edit: Unanswered questions still remains because they are new:\n\n1.\n\n&gt;It does not fail when unused, but the flash chips can lose their charges after 5-8 years of not getting power, which means that it possibly can lose its data\n\n\nSo say that 5 to 8 years thing was a fact, not approximation. I\u2019m having trouble understanding what the Redditor would mean then:\n\nDoes that mean if you were to power it on once every four years, it could last decades?\n\n\nI want to ask this ^ question in regards to both SSDs, and HDD\u2019s.\n\n____\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n2.\n\nWhen I\u2019m still just trying to figure out though, is, what would **you reckon** would **generally** last longer:\n\n\u2022HDD being powered every ~2-5 years for 10 hours, then back to ~2-5 years off again, 10 hours back on, ~2-5 years off, etc.\n\n\u2022HDD being off in storage\n\n\u2022SSD being powered every ~2-5 years for 10 hours, then back to ~2-5 years off again, 10 hours back on, ~2-5 years off, etc.\n\n\u2022SSD being off in storage\n\nAssuming whatever storage device you are using is new and of good quality.\n\n\nEdit 2:\n\n3.\n\nWhat type of disc does a HDD use. CD-R? CD-RW? DVD? Nintendo GameCube disc? Single layer? Dual layer? Heavy duty, something that lasts a while (even if the moving parts/components/casing of the HDD are broken)?\n\nEdit: just found out an HDD is not an actual spinning CD it\u2019s just a spinning circle of metal with microscopic magnets on it.  This is what I had written down on here about it before I found this out:\n\nSomeone from serverfault said this:\n\n&gt; many of us know what happens to a hard drive that's been stored for 20 years - they won't spin up 90+% of the time. \n\nOK, suppose that happens to a hard drive. In typical fashion. Are they saying that the disc/data is still good, but it just won\u2019t be able to spin? In other words, the parts that make it spin are broke? Not the actual data is lost?\n\nLike, if you were to take that disc and put it into another HDD (by swapping out the actual discs), it would still work?\n\n\n\nit\u2019s usually salvageable still?\n\n\n\n4. \n\nAlso,\n\n Another Redditor said:\n\n&gt;Yes, refreshing the data would restart the clock on how long the data would be retained in the memory.\n\nHow many times could you do this? times could you probably do this*\n\n\nLike say you get lucky and for some fucked up bizarre reason you don\u2019t need to refresh your HDD every year or two and instead you get lucky and you find some nearly-magic one that is about to die at year 4.1 every time but you refresh it at year 4.0 every time. \n\nSo okay here\u2019s the timeline.\n\n\nYou just get the HDD. Year 4.1 is approaching, so you refresh it at 4.0. Another 4.1 years is approaching, so your refresh it at 4.0 again.\n\nNow you got eight years out of it. Then 12, then 16, etc. Say the universe somehow has just got your back with this pattern right here.\n\nBasically, my question is, if you refresh it enough, before it dies, every time, is it something that you could get like 40, 50 years out of? Maybe even 70? If you refresh it before it dies every time?\n\n\nLike is that how it works? When you \u201crenew it/refresh it\u201d, it\u2019s like it\u2019s brand new again?\n\nI know mechanical parts will fail after decades, but, like is this a way to seriously seriously seriously elongate it.\n\nAnd perhaps by how much?\n\nFeel free to post **reckonings**. Just because we\u2019re on Reddit not everything has to be a fact.  Reckonings mean a lot to me.\n\n\nEdit: \n\n5. You can\u2019t take the spinning disc/platter thing (let\u2019s just call it \u201cthe disk\u201c/circle part of the HDD) if other components of the HDD fails and just simply insert it into another HDD that has working components? (Sort of like just taking a GameCube disc out of a broken GameCube and inserting it into a working game cube? That sort of analogy).  Like  this is quite uncommon/very very very expensive and only really constitutes as forensics? It\u2019s not literally as simple as taking out a circle and putting it into something that has working outer components?", "author_fullname": "t2_twezzrht", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Beginners storage questions for LONG-TERM, LOW maintenance", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_16vhjqu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1696041411.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696008043.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Edit: See edit.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Do you know the answer to this?

When you \u201crenew it/refresh it\u201d, it\u2019s like it\u2019s brand new again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know mechanical parts will fail after decades, but, like is this a way to seriously seriously seriously elongate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And perhaps by how much?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to post &lt;strong&gt;reckonings&lt;/strong&gt;. Just because we\u2019re on Reddit not everything has to be a fact.  Reckonings mean a lot to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can\u2019t take the spinning disc/platter thing (let\u2019s just call it \u201cthe disk\u201c/circle part of the HDD) if other components of the HDD fails and just simply insert it into another HDD that has working components? (Sort of like just taking a GameCube disc out of a broken GameCube and inserting it into a working game cube? That sort of analogy).  Like  this is quite uncommon/very very very expensive and only really constitutes as forensics? It\u2019s not literally as simple as taking out a circle and putting it into something that has working outer components?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

However my pc is a little old and isn't very powerful (IntelCore i5-3570 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 20 Gigs of RAM, 4 Cores 4 Logical Processors)  so softRAID systems are probably out. Also speed is not much of an issue. My pc only has regular USB and USB 3.0. For my Budget, I'd like to keep it under $1700 but can go higher if I absolutely have to.\n\nFor the last 3 weeks I've been looking into what is the best way to go about this from the beginning.

I understand I can only can do this with a DAS and I'm also a little worried about the long RAID rebuilds when a drive eventually fails. I can also access my files from anywhere using this method rather than NAS for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what I've sort of figured out so far and am leaning toward:\n\n**Synology DS1821+ NAS** ($1000). I didn't even know what a NAS was a few weeks ago but this Synology system seems like the easiest way to go about this. I like the idea/feature of SHR-2 and the 1821 supports the ability to slowly add drives to it as space runs out, while also being able to recover the data in the event of a disk failure. Its also expandable beyond 8 bays. They also look to have the best customer service of all brands as well as an easy to use interface for setting up and monitoring the health of the array.\n\nBut here are my issues with this unit:\n\n\\-I don't know much of anything about NAS so at my experience level I might be in over my head or could easily screw something up. This unit could also be more than what I need right now.\n\n\\-108TB volume limit which may not be an issue but I'm not sure due to lack of experience. \n\n\\-Way too expensive to backup online.\n\n\\-I've read they are overpriced for what you're actually getting and they want you to use their own   \n brand of drives and have been applying a warning message to non-synology HDDs which could be a   \n future problem. WD HDDs switch to \"warning\" after 3 years.\n\nOR\n\n**OWC ThunderBay 8 RAID 5 Edition 8-Bay** ($900) This unit seems pretty good quality, it's incredibly expandable, and can be backed up via USB on BackBlaze, which makes me less nervous about only having RAID 5. However some pretty major issues are holding me up:\n\n\\-I would have to buy all drives at once ($3-4000!) as you can't add as you go.\n\n\\-SoftRAID only, which I understand is worse than hardware RAID and would likely give my weak pc   \n trouble. Also does not feature RAID 6.\n\n\\-There are cheaper alternatives that look to do about the same thing.\n\nOR\n\nI've also looked at several **QNAP** units but have been unable to find one that is 8 bay DAS, has RAID 6 or similar and connects to a regular USB or USB 3.0.  I've looked at many but it's very possible I missed one that would best work for me. The QNAP TL-D800C isn't expandable beyond the 8 bays, doesn't look to have hardware RAID, and says it's only compatible with devices with USB 3.2. The QNAP TR-004 looks like a solid unit but only has 4 bays, RAID 5 and I'd likely have to buy 2 or 3 and use them separately. Some other units were very expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I've looked at cheaper or lesser known brands like **Orico**, **RocketStor**, **MAIWO 8 Bay** and **MobileRAID MR8UT6G**. Some of these look promising however they've either got several bad reviews, seem pretty old or I just can't find enough information about them to be able to faithfully purchase one. Please let me know if I'm making a mistake not going with a lesser known brand!\n\nI would greatly appreciate the help of someone more knowledgeable than me; this is a big purchase and I don't want to screw it up. Is there some obvious solution that I'm overlooking? Should I just buy another external HDD for now until I get a more powerful pc? Am I overthinking all this?
