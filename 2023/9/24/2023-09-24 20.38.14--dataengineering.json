We&amp;#39;ve been building data pipelines and a data warehouse using mostly API and SQL/ODBC within Python on scheduled jobs. We got the data cleaned up and into proper fields, so hopefully one day 50 years from now when a data engineer or data scientist gets approved they have something clean to work with. I don&amp;#39;t expect to be here after a couple years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that to say I can&amp;#39;t even get $10/month subscriptions to Power BI approved for non-management (for again a company of 150 that brings in $500+ mil per year). They&amp;#39;re starting to see the big picture though - Power BI with DirectQuery to the data warehouse has been a game changer over emailing dozens (30+ spreadsheets) every morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve looking around and realizing it&amp;#39;s FUNCTIONAL but not scalable in the long term. It&amp;#39;ll be a Ford Focus by the time it&amp;#39;s fully complete, but everyone else is making and driving Escalades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long backstory - We need more than ONE data warehouse, which $1600 cost took three months to approve. Wish I was exaggerating about this. Eventually when the whole company moves to the data warehouse for information it will start to run slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to stay within the Microsoft ecosystem since we don&amp;#39;t have the technical bandwidth/skill level to do otherwise. Is a handful of SQL Express servers a reasonable/&amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; way to balance the load? If it gets too heavy on the data warehouse, would SQL Express on a separate server work as a &amp;quot;helper&amp;quot; for some of the jobs/calculating?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What general advice can you give since probably many of you have been through similar?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "16qx129", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BestTomatillo6197", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/16qx129/is_it_bad_practice_to_use_sql_server_express_in/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16qx129/is_it_bad_practice_to_use_sql_server_express_in/", "subreddit_subscribers": 130205, "created_utc": 1695559920.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "My title within my company is 'Data developer', but I do data engineering for 90% of the time.

One project I want to try is to use DBT Core to implement a particular table in MS SQL DB to a small SQLlite. Currently, I use pure python/pandas to do SCD2. But I found DBT has a snapshot feature that can easily do SCD2 without doing a lot of code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some questions: is that possible to use DBT to move data from one platform (MS SQL) to another one (SQL Lite), or it has to be the same platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to some tutorials but I found that in the YAML file, it only defines the parameter of the source (MSSQL), I can&amp;#39;t find where it defines the target (SQLLite). So, I&amp;#39;m not sure if DBT can work with two different platform. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find any tutorials to implement SCD2 from MSSQL to SQLLite, please share me the link.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "16qoo00", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "uniznoir", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/16qoo00/try_to_use_dbt_to_implement_scd2_from_ms_sql_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16qoo00/try_to_use_dbt_to_implement_scd2_from_ms_sql_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 130205, "created_utc": 1695530794.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "I\u2019m used to solving data issues related to query tuning , infra scaling , chunking / partitions / shards ect. \n\nBut what to do if you have network issues; I could think making your availability zone closer to data source in cloud or setting up dns.
