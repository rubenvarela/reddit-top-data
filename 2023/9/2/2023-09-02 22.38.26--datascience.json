I would like to use an algorithm like this to come up with new insights in cancer drug discovery and patient stratification based on gene expression and other measured biological variables. \n\nWhat I mean exactly by generating new hypotheses is that combining the LLM-s inherent knowledge about the world, more exactly what it saw during its training to reason about the output of some regression/classification task. A toy example would be the Titanic dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)): Training a linear regression model on the data and calculating the importance of the features will tell us that the passanger class, sex and age were the most important variables. Now comes the LLM: form novel hypotheses explaining the results given the LLM's knowledge about the world (to be fair this would be a biased task, since I'm sure ChatGPT saw many analyses about this exact problem and its potential explanations for the importance of the features).\n\nA prompt for this task could look like this:\n\n*I trained a linear regression model on the Titanic dataset. The most important features were: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp,Parch. Suppose that you are a data scientist and expert on the titanic catastrophe. Come up with 3 testable hypotheses which explains the difference in survival of the passengers. These hypotheses must be completely non-trivial, and something which can be only discovered when combining humanity\u2019s all scientific knowledge with the results from the linear regression model presented above. The more complex the hypotheses are, the better. Below you can see an example of the output I expect:  HYPOTHESIS NAME: STEP-BY-STEP reasoning using your data scientist and titanic catastrophe expertise and the top features from the model, including their relationship with each other:*  \n\nOne of the hypotheses it generated: \n\n***HYPOTHESIS NAME****: Age-Based Physical Vigor and Socio-Cultural Norms*\n\n***STEP-BY-STEP reasoning****:*\n\n1. ***Biology &amp; Physiology****: Older individuals, due to age-related decline, might not have been as agile or physically fit as younger passengers. This could have impeded their ability to reach lifeboats in time or withstand the cold water.*\n2. ***Age Feature****: Younger individuals, especially those in their prime age, might have had better chances due to their physical vigor.*\n3. ***Socio-Cultural Context****: In emergencies, there's a common socio-cultural norm to prioritize saving the elderly, women, and children.*\n4. ***Sex Feature****: As mentioned, women might have been given priority.

I would like to use an algorithm like this to come up with new insights in cancer drug discovery and patient stratification based on gene expression and other measured biological variables. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I mean exactly by generating new hypotheses is that combining the LLM-s inherent knowledge about the world, more exactly what it saw during its training to reason about the output of some regression/classification task. A toy example would be the Titanic dataset (&lt;a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic\"&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic&lt;/a&gt;): Training a linear regression model on the data and calculating the importance of the features will tell us that the passanger class, sex and age were the most important variables. Now comes the LLM: form novel hypotheses explaining the results given the LLM&amp;#39;s knowledge about the world (to be fair this would be a biased task, since I&amp;#39;m sure ChatGPT saw many analyses about this exact problem and its potential explanations for the importance of the features).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A prompt for this task could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I trained a linear regression model on the Titanic dataset. The most important features were: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp,Parch. Suppose that you are a data scientist and expert on the titanic catastrophe. Come up with 3 testable hypotheses which explains the difference in survival of the passengers. These hypotheses must be completely non-trivial, and something which can be only discovered when combining humanity\u2019s all scientific knowledge with the results from the linear regression model presented above. The more complex the hypotheses are, the better. Below you can see an example of the output I expect:  HYPOTHESIS NAME: STEP-BY-STEP reasoning using your data scientist and titanic catastrophe expertise and the top features from the model, including their relationship with each other:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the hypotheses it generated: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HYPOTHESIS NAME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Age-Based Physical Vigor and Socio-Cultural Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;STEP-BY-STEP reasoning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biology &amp;amp; Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Older individuals, due to age-related decline, might not have been as agile or physically fit as younger passengers. This could have impeded their ability to reach lifeboats in time or withstand the cold water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age Feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Younger individuals, especially those in their prime age, might have had better chances due to their physical vigor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socio-Cultural Context&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: In emergencies, there&amp;#39;s a common socio-cultural norm to prioritize saving the elderly, women, and children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: As mentioned, women might have been given priority.

So I also thought about calculating the profit per day, and using it as the \"quantitative value associated\", the score, mentioned before, instead of a subjective rate. That way you would have a profit oriented prediction of manpower needed per day? But I'm worried that it would have a catch that I'm missing.\n\nIf I use the qty of employees per day, qty of units per day, and hours worked per employee per day to calculate the average time that one employee takes to clean one unit, the prediction would induce that everything remains the same, preventing the optimization of time allocating per day, right?

Any and all advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!!! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "99f9652a-d780-11e7-b558-0e52cdd59ace", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "167p1js", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PlusTelephone9598", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/167p1js/applying_to_master_of_data_science/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/167p1js/applying_to_master_of_data_science/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1027619, "created_utc": 1693617532.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_9axqyq8u", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Specializing in which area of DS (or anything related to data) do you think is the most rewarding in the long run?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_167oe5u", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1693615716.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "167oe5u", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Difficult-Big-3890", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/167oe5u/specializing_in_which_area_of_ds_or_anything/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/167oe5u/specializing_in_which_area_of_ds_or_anything/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1027619, "created_utc": 1693615716.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": " I recently took on the Spaceship Titanic Competition on Kaggle and put together an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook.\n\n**Here is the link to my Kaggle notebook:** [**Click Here**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samtam22/spaceship-titanic-competition-eda)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on:\n\n1.
