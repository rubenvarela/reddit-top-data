hypotheses based on LLM reasoning ability on the output of machine learning algorithms. I would like to use an algorithm like this to come up with new insights in cancer drug discovery and patient stratification based on gene expression and other measured biological variables. \n\nWhat I mean exactly by generating new hypotheses is that combining the LLM-s inherent knowledge about the world, more exactly what it saw during its training to reason about the output of some regression/classification task. A toy example would be the Titanic dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)): Training a linear regression model on the data and calculating the importance of the features will tell us that the passanger class, sex and age were the most important variables. Now comes the LLM: form novel hypotheses explaining the results given the LLM's knowledge about the world (to be fair this would be a biased task, since I'm sure ChatGPT saw many analyses about this exact problem and its potential explanations for the importance of the features).\n\nA prompt for this task could look like this:\n\n*I trained a linear regression model on the Titanic dataset. The most important features were: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp,Parch. Suppose that you are a data scientist and expert on the titanic catastrophe. Come up with 3 testable hypotheses which explains the difference in survival of the passengers. These hypotheses must be completely non-trivial, and something which can be only discovered when combining humanity\u2019s all scientific knowledge with the results from the linear regression model presented above. The more complex the hypotheses are, the better. Below you can see an example of the output I expect:  HYPOTHESIS NAME: STEP-BY-STEP reasoning using your data scientist and titanic catastrophe expertise and the top features from the model, including their relationship with each other:*  \n\nOne of the hypotheses it generated: \n\n***HYPOTHESIS NAME****: Age-Based Physical Vigor and Socio-Cultural Norms*\n\n***STEP-BY-STEP reasoning****:*\n\n1. ***Biology &amp; Physiology****: Older individuals, due to age-related decline, might not have been as agile or physically fit as younger passengers. This could have impeded their ability to reach lifeboats in time or withstand the cold water.*\n2. ***Age Feature****: Younger individuals, especially those in their prime age, might have had better chances due to their physical vigor.*\n3. ***Socio-Cultural Context****: In emergencies, there's a common socio-cultural norm to prioritize saving the elderly, women, and children.*\n4. ***Sex Feature****: As mentioned, women might have been given priority. When combined with Age, it suggests that younger women might have had the highest survival rate.*\n5. ***Synthesis****: While younger individuals had a biological advantage, the societal values might have made it more challenging for younger males to secure a place in lifeboats, as the focus might have been on saving women and the elderly. The interaction between Age and Sex can provide insights into this dynamic.*\n\nAgain, probably this is highly biased by other analyses published on this exact dataset, so probably ChatGPT has already seen this during the training phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you know if anybody has done something similar like this before and has applied to some real-world problems which were not seen by the LLM during training?

Below you can see an example of the output I expect:  HYPOTHESIS NAME: STEP-BY-STEP reasoning using your data scientist and titanic catastrophe expertise and the top features from the model, including their relationship with each other:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the hypotheses it generated: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HYPOTHESIS NAME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Age-Based Physical Vigor and Socio-Cultural Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;STEP-BY-STEP reasoning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biology &amp;amp; Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Older individuals, due to age-related decline, might not have been as agile or physically fit as younger passengers. This could have impeded their ability to reach lifeboats in time or withstand the cold water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age Feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Younger individuals, especially those in their prime age, might have had better chances due to their physical vigor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socio-Cultural Context&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: In emergencies, there&amp;#39;s a common socio-cultural norm to prioritize saving the elderly, women, and children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: As mentioned, women might have been given priority. When combined with Age, it suggests that younger women might have had the highest survival rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: While younger individuals had a biological advantage, the societal values might have made it more challenging for younger males to secure a place in lifeboats, as the focus might have been on saving women and the elderly. The interaction between Age and Sex can provide insights into this dynamic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, probably this is highly biased by other analyses published on this exact dataset, so probably ChatGPT has already seen this during the training phase. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you know if anybody has done something similar like this before and has applied to some real-world problems which were not seen by the LLM during training? As a scientist, I&amp;#39;m very excited about the possibility to enhance our scientific hypothesis generation skills by LLM-s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some resources I&amp;#39;ve already found: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12208\"&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12208&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Can_GPT-4_formulate_and_test_a_novel_hypothesis_Yes_and_no/22517278\"&gt;https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Can_GPT-4_formulate_and_test_a_novel_hypothesis_Yes_and_no/22517278&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c9233c3a-b336-11ed-b456-fab66c9d9d9e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_7hqomg", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "167y1yx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "l3tan", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/ChatGPT/comments/167y1yx/generating_scientific_hypotheses_using_chatgpt_or/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/167y1yx/generating_scientific_hypotheses_using_chatgpt_or/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3008333, "created_utc": 1693647164.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1693647239.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.ChatGPT", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/ChatGPT/comments/167y1yx/generating_scientific_hypotheses_using_chatgpt_or/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "167y2og", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "l3tan", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_167y1yx", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/167y2og/generating_scientific_hypotheses_using_chatgpt_or/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/ChatGPT/comments/167y1yx/generating_scientific_hypotheses_using_chatgpt_or/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1026561, "created_utc": 1693647239.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I have predominantly been engaged in risk analytics and now aspire to pivot towards marketing analytics.
