The rules detect errors by identifying classifications that may be incorrect and then re-assign to a new class. While recall can drop for a given class, we can bound the drop in recall with a hyperparameter - but this is guaranteed to improve precision. This is illustrated in the below figure. We show this approach leads to an overall improvement in accuracy over the base model, including the state-of-the-art. We also examine the effects when encountering classes not seen in the model's training data.\n\nWe provide theoretical as well as empirical results and believe this approach can be used in other use-cases in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vygj8qh1fulb1.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=debe7d3ba0d0dd963ad2accabb6d24f3f5273403", "author_fullname": "t2_u8v5y5z0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Metacognitive model improvement with EDCR", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "projects", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "media_metadata": {"vygj8qh1fulb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 79, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vygj8qh1fulb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=370c05dbdfb33e8484c8258a41e32b066d00f8a4"}, {"y": 159, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vygj8qh1fulb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db27ee0f492f40ff8b0e95ea04090238d964e5d5"}, {"y": 236, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vygj8qh1fulb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1409888b43781d26627584b725c9a8b658349ce5"}], "s": {"y": 470, "x": 635, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vygj8qh1fulb1.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=debe7d3ba0d0dd963ad2accabb6d24f3f5273403"}, "id": "vygj8qh1fulb1"}}, "name": "t3_1682d8l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_OV4lap_rk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

A toy example would be the Titanic dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)): Training a linear regression model on the data and calculating the importance of the features will tell us that the passanger class, sex and age were the most important variables.

The most important features were: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp,Parch. Suppose that you are a data scientist and expert on the titanic catastrophe. Come up with 3 testable hypotheses which explains the difference in survival of the passengers.

When combined with Age, it suggests that younger women might have had the highest survival rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: While younger individuals had a biological advantage, the societal values might have made it more challenging for younger males to secure a place in lifeboats, as the focus might have been on saving women and the elderly. The interaction between Age and Sex can provide insights into this dynamic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, probably this is highly biased by other analyses published on this exact dataset, so probably ChatGPT has already seen this during the training phase. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you know if anybody has done something similar like this before and has applied to some real-world problems which were not seen by the LLM during training?
