I\u2019ve been wanting to ask this question for months, now I\u2019m finally writing this lol (english is not my main language).\n\nI\u2019m a Mechanical Engineering that wished to have done another College, like Mechatronics Electrical, or Computer Engineering. But I was at the end when I realized that, so I decided that was best to finish my graduation (did a 3D printed robot with Arduino in my final project) and steer my career towards more automation and digital skills. I always liked computers, and had that itch feeling that I had to learn how to code. I tried Python in 2019, 2020, but it never made sense to me, it didn\u2019t feel useful.\n\nOne year after my graduation (2021) started to work and learned on my own a lot of advanced Excel tools like Power Query and VBA, doing automatic data treatment, data analysis, dynamic Dashboards for my Manager, and I really like doing that. At the same time, I was studying a Master Black Belt certificate on Lean Six Sigma for continuous improvement. I used tools on Lean Six Sigma to create a career plan for myself, setting goals, why I wanted those goals, what I needed to do in order to achieve it and deadlines. When I became very good at Excel, I knew that the next big step was to learn how to code. Then I started my post-graduate degree in Intelligent Business and Industry 4.0, it was amazing and even thought they talked a lot about Digital Skills and new tech (IoT, AI, Big Data, Robotics), it was more focused on the business side of it.\n\nAt the end of 2022 I got another job that had a very intelligent coworker, he knew a lot about Python and that was the exact language that I wanted to learn. In the 4 months that we worked together, I learned a lot with him and saw what was possible with coding, the possibilities were endless! I got the hang of it quickly (my skills in Excel and problem solving from Engineering helped a lot) and that itch finally got scratched. I feel that flow state when I\u2019m coding, it\u2019s satisfying. Now almost one year later since I started learning Python, I did a lot of projects in my current job: creating dashboards on Excel that calls Python scripts to do tons of automated tasks, pull that from database, compare files to check for changes, automating of repetitive tasks, data treatment, etc.\n\nI consider myself to be have low-intermediate skills in Python. I know that I can\u2019t compete directly against someone that did Computer Science and studied for years and have way more experience and knowledge than me. But I know that I have a good combination of skills for Business Intelligence: Understating how things work, project management, problem solving from Engineering; Improve and optimize process using tools from Lean Six Sigma; Data Analysis skills with Excel and Python, generate value from raw data into something useful for a business.\n\nTo give more credibility than just learning on my own, I\u2019m planning to do the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course, to give me a more solid foundation about computers. Then I\u2019d do the IBM Data Analyst course, to improve my skills in data analysis with Excel, Python, SQL and Power BI. What do you guys think, this is a good plan? What would be your suggestions? I would love to read it!\nThanks for reading!\n\nTL:DR: I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate who initially wasn't into coding but later found a passion for Python. I developed advanced Excel skills, learned Lean Six Sigma, and pursued a post-graduate program in Intelligent Business and Industry 4.0. In my current job, I've become good in Python, using it for automation and data analysis. I plan to enhance my skills by taking CS50 and an IBM Data Analyst course to solidify my computer science and data analysis expertise, aiming for a career in Business Intelligence.", "author_fullname": "t2_4q0g5agv", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Career change: My next steps into Coding and Data Analysis", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_16p9s2p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1695387768.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning everyone!

I got the hang of it quickly (my skills in Excel and problem solving from Engineering helped a lot) and that itch finally got scratched. I feel that flow state when I\u2019m coding, it\u2019s satisfying. Now almost one year later since I started learning Python, I did a lot of projects in my current job: creating dashboards on Excel that calls Python scripts to do tons of automated tasks, pull that from database, compare files to check for changes, automating of repetitive tasks, data treatment, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I consider myself to be have low-intermediate skills in Python. I know that I can\u2019t compete directly against someone that did Computer Science and studied for years and have way more experience and knowledge than me. But I know that I have a good combination of skills for Business Intelligence: Understating how things work, project management, problem solving from Engineering; Improve and optimize process using tools from Lean Six Sigma; Data Analysis skills with Excel and Python, generate value from raw data into something useful for a business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give more credibility than just learning on my own, I\u2019m planning to do the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course, to give me a more solid foundation about computers. Then I\u2019d do the IBM Data Analyst course, to improve my skills in data analysis with Excel, Python, SQL and Power BI. What do you guys think, this is a good plan? What would be your suggestions? I would love to read it!\nThanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR: I&amp;#39;m a Mechanical Engineering graduate who initially wasn&amp;#39;t into coding but later found a passion for Python. I developed advanced Excel skills, learned Lean Six Sigma, and pursued a post-graduate program in Intelligent Business and Industry 4.0. In my current job, I&amp;#39;ve become good in Python, using it for automation and data analysis. I plan to enhance my skills by taking CS50 and an IBM Data Analyst course to solidify my computer science and data analysis expertise, aiming for a career in Business Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "16p9s2p", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DestructorEFX", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/16p9s2p/career_change_my_next_steps_into_coding_and_data/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16p9s2p/career_change_my_next_steps_into_coding_and_data/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1056194, "created_utc": 1695387768.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi all, I\u2019m working in data analytics field as a data scientist.
