So I don&amp;#39;t need to rip them to ISO or BIN/CUE&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I will, after getting them all on my NAS, be working to de-duplicate and ultimately combine all the data into a unified folder structure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a workstation at my desk with a 10gb fiber connection to my Synology. Ideally, I want a tool for Windows that will read a CD-ROM upon insertion, make a folder with the volume name at the destination, copy/verify every file. retry on errors and then wait for the next disc to be inserted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can of course do something with Powershell or RoboCopy, but I would much prefer a decent UI, a progress bar, and so on. Similarly, I think I could make something work with the Synology USB-Copy tool, but the NAS is far away, and constantly having to go there would be silly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did search the subreddit and found a lot of great ideas for doing this by making individual images of the discs, but ultimately that would just force me to expand the images later to achieve the same result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "16a10ur", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "realityczek", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/16a10ur/archive_cdroms_to_nas_not_by_making_images/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16a10ur/archive_cdroms_to_nas_not_by_making_images/", "subreddit_subscribers": 701712, "created_utc": 1693854802.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Quick question, searched the sub before asking and seagates website no longer shows the ability to compare exos x14 vs x16.\n\nDoes anyone know what the difference is other than manufacture date?\n\nI built my plex server a few months ago with a good deal on 4 renewed 12TB x16 exos drives from a well known/well reviewed reseller. \n\nThe seller seems to have a good reputation/offer a good warranty so I\u2019d like to stick with them.
