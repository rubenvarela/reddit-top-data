Heavy duty, something that lasts a while (even if the moving parts/components/casing of the HDD are broken)?\n\nSomeone from server fault said this:\n\n&gt; many of us know what happens to a hard drive that's been stored for 20 years - they won't spin up 90+% of the time. \n\nOK, suppose that happens to a hard drive. In typical fashion. Are they saying that the desk/data is still good, but it just won\u2019t be able to spin? In other words, the parts that make it spin are broke? Not the actual date is lost?\n\nLike, if you were to take that disk and put it into another HDD (by swapping out the actual discs), it would still work?\n\n\n\nit\u2019s usually salvageable still?\n\n\n\n4. \n\nAlso,\n\n Another Redditor said:\n\n&gt;Yes, refreshing the data would restart the clock on how long the data would be retained in the memory.\n\nHow many times could you do this? times could you probably do this*\n\n\nLike say you get lucky and for some fucked up bizarre reason you don\u2019t need to refresh your HDD every year or two and instead you get lucky and you find some nearly-magic one that is about to die at year 4.1 every time but you refresh it at year 4.0 every time. \n\nSo okay here\u2019s the timeline.\n\n\nYou just get the HDD. Year 4.1 is approaching, so you refresh it at 4.0. Another 4.1 years is approaching, so your refresh it at 4.0 again.\n\nNow you got eight years out of it. Then 12, then 16, etc. Say the universe somehow has just got your back with this pattern right here.\n\nBasically, my question is, if you refresh it enough, before it dies, every time, is it something that you could get like 40, 50 years out of? Maybe even 70? If you refresh it before it dies every time?\n\n\nLike is that how it works? When you \u201crenew it/refresh it\u201d, it\u2019s like it\u2019s brand new again?\n\nI know mechanical parts will fail after decades, but, like is this a way to seriously seriously seriously elongate it.\n\nAnd perhaps by how much?\n\nFeel free to post **reckonings**. Just because we\u2019re on Reddit not everything has to be a fact.

I need help deciding on what to go with. I'm looking for a system with the capacity for a large amount of storage, probably no more than 200TB, that I will mostly download stuff (music and video files, personal/family memories, old HDDs) to over the next few years and watch movies/listen to music from. However my pc is a little old and isn't very powerful (IntelCore i5-3570 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 20 Gigs of RAM, 4 Cores 4 Logical Processors)  so softRAID systems are probably out. Also speed is not much of an issue. My pc only has regular USB and USB 3.0. For my Budget, I'd like to keep it under $1700 but can go higher if I absolutely have to.\n\nFor the last 3 weeks I've been looking into what is the best way to go about this from the beginning. I was hoping to start out with just 1 or 2 18TB or 20TB HDDs and slowly add more as needed, but this seems to be a less common feature than I assumed.\n\n**What I would like:**\n\n8-bay (or more depending on price) as I could probably fill up a 4 bay within a year\n\nAbility to add a new HDD when space is running low rather than buying them all at once\n\nNot pc intensive\n\nRaid 6 or SHR-2 hardware (I've read that for the size of drives and amount of data this seems to be a must)\n\nEasy to use interface and drive health monitoring\n\nAbility to back up to BackBlaze preferred. I understand I can only can do this with a DAS and I'm also a little worried about the long RAID rebuilds when a drive eventually fails. I can also access my files from anywhere using this method rather than NAS for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what I've sort of figured out so far and am leaning toward:\n\n**Synology DS1821+ NAS** ($1000). I didn't even know what a NAS was a few weeks ago but this Synology system seems like the easiest way to go about this. I like the idea/feature of SHR-2 and the 1821 supports the ability to slowly add drives to it as space runs out, while also being able to recover the data in the event of a disk failure. Its also expandable beyond 8 bays. They also look to have the best customer service of all brands as well as an easy to use interface for setting up and monitoring the health of the array.\n\nBut here are my issues with this unit:\n\n\\-I don't know much of anything about NAS so at my experience level I might be in over my head or could easily screw something up. This unit could also be more than what I need right now.\n\n\\-108TB volume limit which may not be an issue but I'm not sure due to lack of experience. \n\n\\-Way too expensive to backup online.\n\n\\-I've read they are overpriced for what you're actually getting and they want you to use their own   \n brand of drives and have been applying a warning message to non-synology HDDs which could be a   \n future problem. WD HDDs switch to \"warning\" after 3 years.\n\nOR\n\n**OWC ThunderBay 8 RAID 5 Edition 8-Bay** ($900) This unit seems pretty good quality, it's incredibly expandable, and can be backed up via USB on BackBlaze, which makes me less nervous about only having RAID 5. However some pretty major issues are holding me up:\n\n\\-I would have to buy all drives at once ($3-4000!) as you can't add as you go.\n\n\\-SoftRAID only, which I understand is worse than hardware RAID and would likely give my weak pc   \n trouble. Also does not feature RAID 6.\n\n\\-There are cheaper alternatives that look to do about the same thing.\n\nOR\n\nI've also looked at several **QNAP** units but have been unable to find one that is 8 bay DAS, has RAID 6 or similar and connects to a regular USB or USB 3.0.  I've looked at many but it's very possible I missed one that would best work for me. The QNAP TL-D800C isn't expandable beyond the 8 bays, doesn't look to have hardware RAID, and says it's only compatible with devices with USB 3.2. The QNAP TR-004 looks like a solid unit but only has 4 bays, RAID 5 and I'd likely have to buy 2 or 3 and use them separately. Some other units were very expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I've looked at cheaper or lesser known brands like **Orico**, **RocketStor**, **MAIWO 8 Bay** and **MobileRAID MR8UT6G**. Some of these look promising however they've either got several bad reviews, seem pretty old or I just can't find enough information about them to be able to faithfully purchase one. Please let me know if I'm making a mistake not going with a lesser known brand!\n\nI would greatly appreciate the help of someone more knowledgeable than me; this is a big purchase and I don't want to screw it up. Is there some obvious solution that I'm overlooking? Should I just buy another external HDD for now until I get a more powerful pc? Am I overthinking all this?

Other times starting up it will all be fine and no errors will be reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I assume is probably hardware/cable related or the NetApp is on its way out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have so far&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Used a different Dell H200E card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changed to a brand new QSFP cable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;changed to use other controller on the back of the NetApp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plugged in both PSU&amp;#39;s (only one was in past) in case of power issues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas of things I can try? I can go back to Proxmox again to see if its TrueNAS related but want to see if there anything else?   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "664a26e4-322a-11e6-80ae-0e0378709321", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2ubz7", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff6347", "id": "16uqukn", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "yggdrtygj6542", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/homelab/comments/16uqukn/netapp_ds4246_zfs_periodic_drive_readwrite_errors/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/16uqukn/netapp_ds4246_zfs_periodic_drive_readwrite_errors/", "subreddit_subscribers": 601843, "created_utc": 1695933375.0, "num_crossposts": 2, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1695967667.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.homelab", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/homelab/comments/16uqukn/netapp_ds4246_zfs_periodic_drive_readwrite_errors/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5b6d7a04-b94e-11eb-b676-0ed4dfcb172d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "16v3ow0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "yggdrtygj6542", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_16uqukn", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/16v3ow0/netapp_ds4246_zfs_periodic_drive_readwrite_errors/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/homelab/comments/16uqukn/netapp_ds4246_zfs_periodic_drive_readwrite_errors/", "subreddit_subscribers": 704124, "created_utc": 1695967667.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hopefully r/DataHoarders can help with this.
