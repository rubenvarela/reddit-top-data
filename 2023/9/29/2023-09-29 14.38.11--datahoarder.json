I need help deciding on what to go with. I'm looking for a system with the capacity for a large amount of storage, probably no more than 200TB, that I will mostly download stuff (music and video files, personal/family memories, old HDDs) to over the next few years and watch movies/listen to music from. However my pc is a little old and isn't very powerful (IntelCore i5-3570 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 20 Gigs of RAM, 4 Cores 4 Logical Processors)  so softRAID systems are probably out. Also speed is not much of an issue. My pc only has regular USB and USB 3.0. For my Budget, I'd like to keep it under $1700 but can go higher if I absolutely have to.\n\nFor the last 3 weeks I've been looking into what is the best way to go about this from the beginning. I was hoping to start out with just 1 or 2 18TB or 20TB HDDs and slowly add more as needed, but this seems to be a less common feature than I assumed.\n\n**What I would like:**\n\n8-bay (or more depending on price) as I could probably fill up a 4 bay within a year\n\nAbility to add a new HDD when space is running low rather than buying them all at once\n\nNot pc intensive\n\nRaid 6 or SHR-2 hardware (I've read that for the size of drives and amount of data this seems to be a must)\n\nEasy to use interface and drive health monitoring\n\nAbility to back up to BackBlaze preferred. I understand I can only can do this with a DAS and I'm also a little worried about the long RAID rebuilds when a drive eventually fails. I can also access my files from anywhere using this method rather than NAS for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what I've sort of figured out so far and am leaning toward:\n\n**Synology DS1821+ NAS** ($1000). I didn't even know what a NAS was a few weeks ago but this Synology system seems like the easiest way to go about this. I like the idea/feature of SHR-2 and the 1821 supports the ability to slowly add drives to it as space runs out, while also being able to recover the data in the event of a disk failure. Its also expandable beyond 8 bays. They also look to have the best customer service of all brands as well as an easy to use interface for setting up and monitoring the health of the array.\n\nBut here are my issues with this unit:\n\n\\-I don't know much of anything about NAS so at my experience level I might be in over my head or could easily screw something up. This unit could also be more than what I need right now.\n\n\\-108TB volume limit which may not be an issue but I'm not sure due to lack of experience. \n\n\\-Way too expensive to backup online.\n\n\\-I've read they are overpriced for what you're actually getting and they want you to use their own   \n brand of drives and have been applying a warning message to non-synology HDDs which could be a   \n future problem. WD HDDs switch to \"warning\" after 3 years.\n\nOR\n\n**OWC ThunderBay 8 RAID 5 Edition 8-Bay** ($900) This unit seems pretty good quality, it's incredibly expandable, and can be backed up via USB on BackBlaze, which makes me less nervous about only having RAID 5. However some pretty major issues are holding me up:\n\n\\-I would have to buy all drives at once ($3-4000!) as you can't add as you go.\n\n\\-SoftRAID only, which I understand is worse than hardware RAID and would likely give my weak pc   \n trouble. Also does not feature RAID 6.\n\n\\-There are cheaper alternatives that look to do about the same thing.\n\nOR\n\nI've also looked at several **QNAP** units but have been unable to find one that is 8 bay DAS, has RAID 6 or similar and connects to a regular USB or USB 3.0.  I've looked at many but it's very possible I missed one that would best work for me. The QNAP TL-D800C isn't expandable beyond the 8 bays, doesn't look to have hardware RAID, and says it's only compatible with devices with USB 3.2. The QNAP TR-004 looks like a solid unit but only has 4 bays, RAID 5 and I'd likely have to buy 2 or 3 and use them separately. Some other units were very expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I've looked at cheaper or lesser known brands like **Orico**, **RocketStor**, **MAIWO 8 Bay** and **MobileRAID MR8UT6G**. Some of these look promising however they've either got several bad reviews, seem pretty old or I just can't find enough information about them to be able to faithfully purchase one. Please let me know if I'm making a mistake not going with a lesser known brand!\n\nI would greatly appreciate the help of someone more knowledgeable than me; this is a big purchase and I don't want to screw it up. Is there some obvious solution that I'm overlooking? Should I just buy another external HDD for now until I get a more powerful pc? Am I overthinking all this?

I was hoping to start out with just 1 or 2 18TB or 20TB HDDs and slowly add more as needed, but this seems to be a less common feature than I assumed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I would like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8-bay (or more depending on price) as I could probably fill up a 4 bay within a year&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ability to add a new HDD when space is running low rather than buying them all at once&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not pc intensive&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Raid 6 or SHR-2 hardware (I&amp;#39;ve read that for the size of drives and amount of data this seems to be a must)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easy to use interface and drive health monitoring&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ability to back up to BackBlaze preferred. I understand I can only can do this with a DAS and I&amp;#39;m also a little worried about the long RAID rebuilds when a drive eventually fails. I can also access my files from anywhere using this method rather than NAS for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is what I&amp;#39;ve sort of figured out so far and am leaning toward:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synology DS1821+ NAS&lt;/strong&gt; ($1000). I didn&amp;#39;t even know what a NAS was a few weeks ago but this Synology system seems like the easiest way to go about this. I like the idea/feature of SHR-2 and the 1821 supports the ability to slowly add drives to it as space runs out, while also being able to recover the data in the event of a disk failure. Its also expandable beyond 8 bays. They also look to have the best customer service of all brands as well as an easy to use interface for setting up and monitoring the health of the array.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here are my issues with this unit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I don&amp;#39;t know much of anything about NAS so at my experience level I might be in over my head or could easily screw something up. This unit could also be more than what I need right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-108TB volume limit which may not be an issue but I&amp;#39;m not sure due to lack of experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Way too expensive to backup online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I&amp;#39;ve read they are overpriced for what you&amp;#39;re actually getting and they want you to use their own&lt;br/&gt;\n brand of drives and have been applying a warning message to non-synology HDDs which could be a&lt;br/&gt;\n future problem. WD HDDs switch to &amp;quot;warning&amp;quot; after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OWC ThunderBay 8 RAID 5 Edition 8-Bay&lt;/strong&gt; ($900) This unit seems pretty good quality, it&amp;#39;s incredibly expandable, and can be backed up via USB on BackBlaze, which makes me less nervous about only having RAID 5. However some pretty major issues are holding me up:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I would have to buy all drives at once ($3-4000!) as you can&amp;#39;t add as you go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-SoftRAID only, which I understand is worse than hardware RAID and would likely give my weak pc&lt;br/&gt;\n trouble. Also does not feature RAID 6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-There are cheaper alternatives that look to do about the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also looked at several &lt;strong&gt;QNAP&lt;/strong&gt; units but have been unable to find one that is 8 bay DAS, has RAID 6 or similar and connects to a regular USB or USB 3.0.  I&amp;#39;ve looked at many but it&amp;#39;s very possible I missed one that would best work for me. The QNAP TL-D800C isn&amp;#39;t expandable beyond the 8 bays, doesn&amp;#39;t look to have hardware RAID, and says it&amp;#39;s only compatible with devices with USB 3.2. The QNAP TR-004 looks like a solid unit but only has 4 bays, RAID 5 and I&amp;#39;d likely have to buy 2 or 3 and use them separately. Some other units were very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;ve looked at cheaper or lesser known brands like &lt;strong&gt;Orico&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;RocketStor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;MAIWO 8 Bay&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MobileRAID MR8UT6G&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of these look promising however they&amp;#39;ve either got several bad reviews, seem pretty old or I just can&amp;#39;t find enough information about them to be able to faithfully purchase one. Please let me know if I&amp;#39;m making a mistake not going with a lesser known brand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate the help of someone more knowledgeable than me; this is a big purchase and I don&amp;#39;t want to screw it up. Is there some obvious solution that I&amp;#39;m overlooking? Should I just buy another external HDD for now until I get a more powerful pc? Am I overthinking all this? Please let me know what you think I should do and thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "16v2ila", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "teknoir84", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/16v2ila/need_help_deciding_probably_overthinking/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16v2ila/need_help_deciding_probably_overthinking/", "subreddit_subscribers": 704056, "created_utc": 1695963668.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I frequently use a panoply of apps and browser extensions to bulk download all images or videos from a given Twitter/X account (JDownloader, ripme, Bulk Image Downloader, Twitter Media Downloader chrome extension), but I've been unable to since Twitter became X.

Ideally I just open a video up in VLC skim through it and add tags in the software. \n\nIf this is possible, whats the best way to search/sort through media with tags I'm looking for to easily move it into Davinci Resolve?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_xhthm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Bulk mp4 meta tag editing for gopro footage", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_16uy59d", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question/Advice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1695950785.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully &lt;a href=\"/r/DataHoarders\"&gt;r/DataHoarders&lt;/a&gt; can help with this.
