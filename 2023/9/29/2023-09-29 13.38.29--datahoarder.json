I didn't even know what a NAS was a few weeks ago but this Synology system seems like the easiest way to go about this. I like the idea/feature of SHR-2 and the 1821 supports the ability to slowly add drives to it as space runs out, while also being able to recover the data in the event of a disk failure. Its also expandable beyond 8 bays. They also look to have the best customer service of all brands as well as an easy to use interface for setting up and monitoring the health of the array.\n\nBut here are my issues with this unit:\n\n\\-I don't know much of anything about NAS so at my experience level I might be in over my head or could easily screw something up. This unit could also be more than what I need right now.\n\n\\-108TB volume limit which may not be an issue but I'm not sure due to lack of experience. \n\n\\-Way too expensive to backup online.\n\n\\-I've read they are overpriced for what you're actually getting and they want you to use their own   \n brand of drives and have been applying a warning message to non-synology HDDs which could be a   \n future problem. WD HDDs switch to \"warning\" after 3 years.\n\nOR\n\n**OWC ThunderBay 8 RAID 5 Edition 8-Bay** ($900) This unit seems pretty good quality, it's incredibly expandable, and can be backed up via USB on BackBlaze, which makes me less nervous about only having RAID 5. However some pretty major issues are holding me up:\n\n\\-I would have to buy all drives at once ($3-4000!) as you can't add as you go.\n\n\\-SoftRAID only, which I understand is worse than hardware RAID and would likely give my weak pc   \n trouble. Also does not feature RAID 6.\n\n\\-There are cheaper alternatives that look to do about the same thing.\n\nOR\n\nI've also looked at several **QNAP** units but have been unable to find one that is 8 bay DAS, has RAID 6 or similar and connects to a regular USB or USB 3.0.  I've looked at many but it's very possible I missed one that would best work for me. The QNAP TL-D800C isn't expandable beyond the 8 bays, doesn't look to have hardware RAID, and says it's only compatible with devices with USB 3.2. The QNAP TR-004 looks like a solid unit but only has 4 bays, RAID 5 and I'd likely have to buy 2 or 3 and use them separately. Some other units were very expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I've looked at cheaper or lesser known brands like **Orico**, **RocketStor**, **MAIWO 8 Bay** and **MobileRAID MR8UT6G**. Some of these look promising however they've either got several bad reviews, seem pretty old or I just can't find enough information about them to be able to faithfully purchase one. Please let me know if I'm making a mistake not going with a lesser known brand!\n\nI would greatly appreciate the help of someone more knowledgeable than me; this is a big purchase and I don't want to screw it up. Is there some obvious solution that I'm overlooking? Should I just buy another external HDD for now until I get a more powerful pc? Am I overthinking all this?

The QNAP TL-D800C isn&amp;#39;t expandable beyond the 8 bays, doesn&amp;#39;t look to have hardware RAID, and says it&amp;#39;s only compatible with devices with USB 3.2. The QNAP TR-004 looks like a solid unit but only has 4 bays, RAID 5 and I&amp;#39;d likely have to buy 2 or 3 and use them separately. Some other units were very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;ve looked at cheaper or lesser known brands like &lt;strong&gt;Orico&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;RocketStor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;MAIWO 8 Bay&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MobileRAID MR8UT6G&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of these look promising however they&amp;#39;ve either got several bad reviews, seem pretty old or I just can&amp;#39;t find enough information about them to be able to faithfully purchase one. Please let me know if I&amp;#39;m making a mistake not going with a lesser known brand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate the help of someone more knowledgeable than me; this is a big purchase and I don&amp;#39;t want to screw it up. Is there some obvious solution that I&amp;#39;m overlooking? Should I just buy another external HDD for now until I get a more powerful pc? Am I overthinking all this?

In the past, I had troubles saving episodes online due to them being only available once the company that owns it TMS would take it down without warning. Recently, I've been mostly buying the DVDs off of import shops as a legal way to own some of the older episodes. However since last year, the DVDs have skipped a ton of episodes between late 2018-early 2021 that haven't been released on DVD meaning those episodes can't be viewed in physical media. I'm praying that since there aren't that many episodes left for both last and this year that they may go back and release those episodes they skipped for 2024, but I also fear that they would go further and have no release for them onto DVD. And keep in mind that it's not like Dragon Ball or One Piece where there's a long story arc, as it's just slice of life.\n\nLast year, I found a Japanese site that had recordings of the episodes from late 2019 to now, and while I saved some episodes that weren't on DVD yet, I wasn't lucky enough to get the rest of them as the time I made this post, as the service that the site uses is Uptobox, which got shut down from the French government.\n\nSo the only legit ways on watching those episodes is either move to Japan (which isn't gonna be a likely option), find someone that lives in Japan that can record those episodes if they run through reruns, or pray that they'll go back and release those missing episodes on DVD.\n\nNow I saw that Hulu and Amazon Prime in Japan has episodes, though Prime has some of the episodes from 2020 that I like to see and download for myself. The issue is that they're region lock and I don't know how to watch them. I heard from some users that you can use a VPN, but I don't know if I get Amazon Prime in the US, would it work in Japan if a VPN is used?

In the past, I had troubles saving episodes online due to them being only available once the company that owns it TMS would take it down without warning. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been mostly buying the DVDs off of import shops as a legal way to own some of the older episodes. However since last year, the DVDs have skipped a ton of episodes between late 2018-early 2021 that haven&amp;#39;t been released on DVD meaning those episodes can&amp;#39;t be viewed in physical media. I&amp;#39;m praying that since there aren&amp;#39;t that many episodes left for both last and this year that they may go back and release those episodes they skipped for 2024, but I also fear that they would go further and have no release for them onto DVD. And keep in mind that it&amp;#39;s not like Dragon Ball or One Piece where there&amp;#39;s a long story arc, as it&amp;#39;s just slice of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year, I found a Japanese site that had recordings of the episodes from late 2019 to now, and while I saved some episodes that weren&amp;#39;t on DVD yet, I wasn&amp;#39;t lucky enough to get the rest of them as the time I made this post, as the service that the site uses is Uptobox, which got shut down from the French government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the only legit ways on watching those episodes is either move to Japan (which isn&amp;#39;t gonna be a likely option), find someone that lives in Japan that can record those episodes if they run through reruns, or pray that they&amp;#39;ll go back and release those missing episodes on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I saw that Hulu and Amazon Prime in Japan has episodes, though Prime has some of the episodes from 2020 that I like to see and download for myself. The issue is that they&amp;#39;re region lock and I don&amp;#39;t know how to watch them. I heard from some users that you can use a VPN, but I don&amp;#39;t know if I get Amazon Prime in the US, would it work in Japan if a VPN is used?
