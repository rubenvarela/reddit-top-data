That's free labor and travel for your company\n\n\n- The office is incredibly distracting.

So many nice little desks, nooks, rooms for you to go to to focus or meet with others. But here's the thing, you never see anyone using those because I guess where they are? At their desk, working, constantly. No one ever has the time to use them. My office is so incredibly nice, and every time I walk around, I feel like I'm the only one taking a walk because I see everyone glued to their desks\n\n- You're distracted constantly by others who are at different levels than you. The only way I figured out that there is some college intern making twice as much as I am doing a little bit more than me is by speaking to people in the immediate vicinity of my desk. Machine learning engineer versus data scientist. The difference? They use a little bit more power platform, a couple more tools, 20 more lines of Python a day. Congrats, here is 40K more for you.

Just disgruntled people\n\n\n- office supplies are shit. At home, I have an ultra wide monitor that I also use for personal PC gaming so I can just literally KVM switch it over. I have a modded gaming mouse and keyboard, a $200 Logitech pro headset with superior sound quality and microphone. You know what I don't have at the office? Any of this stuff. Yeah.
