I&amp;#39;ve been involved in software development for much longer, right before transitioning to DE I was working as a back-end web developer on Java.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking around right now and I&amp;#39;m pretty frustrated with my current state of affairs, not sure what to do next. I attribute my frustration to:\n- I&amp;#39;m pretty goal oriented individual but I work in big corp and it seems like results is not a top priority for anyone here because we are not a part of the core of the business, we are just analytics department, there are two groups of people here: \n  - rest &amp;amp; vest group - this is majority by a very large margin, the level of motivation &amp;amp; competence is very low in this group imo\n  - visibility chasers group - those do need the results but only if it shows them in the right light, they will never confront anyone on years existing problems if they can&amp;#39;t gain something from it\n- It seems to me that it is a general theme in DE world that a level of technical expertise is on a pretty low level due to the fact that very many people came form DA or other completely non-technical roles.\n- Standards for data team formation are not yet crystalized, managers in DE world has no idea what they are doing, as the result you might might be hired as DE but actually mostly performing DA tasks etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see two potential development: \n-  Transition back to SWE, potentially SWE in data world so I can utilize the knowledge of the area of expertise and feel much more comfortable because I&amp;#39;m surrounded by a co-minded people with similar level of competence.\n- Try to get to higher level - Staff level DE so I can start dictate hiring practices and determine a team topology myself. This one also probably imply leaving big corp or joining a team which has actual product build around their Data tools, so they are part of the core of the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Penny for your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "92b74b58-aaca-11eb-b160-0e6181e3773f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "id": "16lchs2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "That-Garage-869", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/16lchs2/de_swestaff_de/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16lchs2/de_swestaff_de/", "subreddit_subscribers": 129039, "created_utc": 1694985528.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "I keep on getting pushed adds for restack .io on Reddit.

Here is when I started to terrify again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know how to start, my friends suggested me some remote job boards but the listings are few and far between and mostly for Sr. positions, I am starting to think that this whole remote thing is for big-brain best-of-the-bunch star engineers. Applied for around 50+ entry to mid level and barely getting even a reply. Besides the fact that I don&amp;#39;t exactly have any credential as a Data Engineer, my experiences are all over the places with random tech and looked like I had career-related second thoughts every year. This might be my biggest shame if I had to name one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, what I pose here is a question: How can I, as a CS graduate can start looking, and preparing for a DE position. Is there any courses, certificates, books serving as a hidden requirement that I am not meeting. And most importantly, how can I even start remote working (some of my friends are remote workers and some friends of them are remote DEs, and I have no clue how they started doing it). I would love to hear about your experiences starting working as a remote DE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and attention. And I am terribly sorry for my tones if it comes off weird or off-putting, as English is only my second language and sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard for me to articulate what&amp;#39;s on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "16l4mj0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rich-Abbreviations27", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/16l4mj0/cs_grad_looking_for_remote_de_entry_pos_but/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16l4mj0/cs_grad_looking_for_remote_de_entry_pos_but/", "subreddit_subscribers": 129039, "created_utc": 1694966951.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
