I've already quit my other job to do this boot camp and I'm now wondering if it's possible to teach myself all the skills required for a data science role. Is there more likelihood of me landing a job if I do attend a bootcamp or is it possible to be self taught and still have opportunity?

My job mostly consists in developing the internal company's software based on the (internal) users' needs. The software is basically a schedule optimizer that uses Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). I mainly develop new features/adjust existing ones, coding in Python, but I don't do most of the SE stuff (databases, APIs, front-end, etc) because we have dedicated SE team members to do that. Therefore, I do only optimization/operations research stuff. Somehow my job title inside the company is Data Scientist. My level is Medior.\n\nI really like my job, but after some years I feel like I could try something new. I would like to learn more about machine learning (ML), not only because it is a really hot topic, but also because, whenever I could \"play\" with it for some minor personal projects, I was always fascinated by the results, so it feels like something I would like to do. Moreover, I feel like I'm hitting the limit on what I can learn on operations research and I also don't see too many optimization jobs out there. I am also turning 31 this year and I feel that the more I wait to start working on ML, the more difficult it will get, with more and more younger minds graduating with ML-specific degrees.(BTW, yes, I know, ML is a big field and it has a lot of tools inside it; I do not know yet specifically in which sector I would like to work on.)\n\nUnfortunately, at my current position I do not have the opportunity to work on anything related to ML. In my company we do have some projects on ML, and more will be started soon, so I could have a chat with my manager and see if I can work on any of them, if they allow me to spend time on learning the tools I have to use first. However, I am also considering jobs in other companies (since mine pays less than the market average), but whenever I search for \"Data Scientist\" jobs, for NON junior positions, they of course require multiple years of experience in ML. I am not willing to be \"downgraded\" from medior to junior just for the sake of working on ML; I don't mind another, better paying, medior position though. However, I am not sure any company would hire me for a ML job for a non junior position if I almost know nothing about it.\n\nWhat's your experience? Has any of you been in a similar situation and managed to get a non entry level job in ML without having too much knowledge about it? Do you think I still have a chance to switch to ML, or should I do \"all in\" on operations research/optimization?

My job mostly consists in developing the internal company&amp;#39;s software based on the (internal) users&amp;#39; needs. The software is basically a schedule optimizer that uses Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). I mainly develop new features/adjust existing ones, coding in Python, but I don&amp;#39;t do most of the SE stuff (databases, APIs, front-end, etc) because we have dedicated SE team members to do that. Therefore, I do only optimization/operations research stuff. Somehow my job title inside the company is Data Scientist. My level is Medior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really like my job, but after some years I feel like I could try something new. I would like to learn more about machine learning (ML), not only because it is a really hot topic, but also because, whenever I could &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; with it for some minor personal projects, I was always fascinated by the results, so it feels like something I would like to do. Moreover, I feel like I&amp;#39;m hitting the limit on what I can learn on operations research and I also don&amp;#39;t see too many optimization jobs out there. I am also turning 31 this year and I feel that the more I wait to start working on ML, the more difficult it will get, with more and more younger minds graduating with ML-specific degrees.(BTW, yes, I know, ML is a big field and it has a lot of tools inside it; I do not know yet specifically in which sector I would like to work on.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, at my current position I do not have the opportunity to work on anything related to ML. In my company we do have some projects on ML, and more will be started soon, so I could have a chat with my manager and see if I can work on any of them, if they allow me to spend time on learning the tools I have to use first. However, I am also considering jobs in other companies (since mine pays less than the market average), but whenever I search for &amp;quot;Data Scientist&amp;quot; jobs, for NON junior positions, they of course require multiple years of experience in ML. I am not willing to be &amp;quot;downgraded&amp;quot; from medior to junior just for the sake of working on ML; I don&amp;#39;t mind another, better paying, medior position though. However, I am not sure any company would hire me for a ML job for a non junior position if I almost know nothing about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your experience? Has any of you been in a similar situation and managed to get a non entry level job in ML without having too much knowledge about it? Do you think I still have a chance to switch to ML, or should I do &amp;quot;all in&amp;quot; on operations research/optimization?

Much appreciated.\n\n**Context**: I'm employed at a company specializing in digitizing materials, each with its unique material properties that require rendering through 3D software. Achieving a realistic rendering necessitates a deeper understanding of a material's physical properties, often obtained through testing rigs. However, these testing processes and machines come at a significant cost. Hence, our aim is to estimate these values based on provided input parameters like density, manufacturing method, and material composition. I've attempted to tackle this problem using both a Random Forest Regressor model and XGBoost, but the Average Percentage Error (APE) across the nine output categories stands at a staggering 250%. Additionally, I conducted a qualitative assessment by rendering these materials in 3D engines, revealing notable discrepancies compared to materials rendered with ground truth values.\n\n**Objective**: Our primary objective is to minimize the prediction error associated with physical property estimation as much as possible. While the exact target remains uncertain, I have a strong sense that an Average Percentage Error of 250% is unacceptably high. Initially, we engaged a machine learning consulting firm, but their model performed even worse, with an APE of 450%.\n\nAvailable Data: We've gathered a limited amount of data and currently possess a dataset of 200 samples after rigorous data cleaning. Cleaning the data improved performance significantly, as it appeared that some observations in the dataset were incorrect.\n\n**Challenges with Proposed Solution:**\n\n1. The predictions generated by our proposed solution deviate significantly from the actual values.\n2. We are not even sure if the output can be described by the input.\n\n**Potential Strategies for Improvement:**\n\n1. Increase the sample size by collecting more data points.\n2. Incorporate additional input features to enhance model performance.\n\nI've shared these details to emphasize the necessity of addressing this matter effectively.
