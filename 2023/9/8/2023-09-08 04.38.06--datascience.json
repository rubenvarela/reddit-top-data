To clarify, I'm not seeking a complete solution from the community; rather, I'm hoping to gather a few ideas or at the very least ascertain whether it's feasible to address this issue given the data currently at our disposal. Much appreciated.\n\n**Context**: I'm employed at a company specializing in digitizing materials, each with its unique material properties that require rendering through 3D software. Achieving a realistic rendering necessitates a deeper understanding of a material's physical properties, often obtained through testing rigs. However, these testing processes and machines come at a significant cost. Hence, our aim is to estimate these values based on provided input parameters like density, manufacturing method, and material composition. I've attempted to tackle this problem using both a Random Forest Regressor model and XGBoost, but the Average Percentage Error (APE) across the nine output categories stands at a staggering 250%. Additionally, I conducted a qualitative assessment by rendering these materials in 3D engines, revealing notable discrepancies compared to materials rendered with ground truth values.\n\n**Objective**: Our primary objective is to minimize the prediction error associated with physical property estimation as much as possible. While the exact target remains uncertain, I have a strong sense that an Average Percentage Error of 250% is unacceptably high. Initially, we engaged a machine learning consulting firm, but their model performed even worse, with an APE of 450%.\n\n**Available Data**: We've gathered a limited amount of data and currently possess a dataset of 200 samples after rigorous data cleaning. Cleaning the data improved performance significantly, as it appeared that some observations in the dataset were incorrect. A plot of one of the target variables and the correlation between input and output variables here can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/eBpGeEo).\n\n**Challenges with Proposed Solution:**\n\n1. The predictions generated by our proposed solution deviate significantly from the actual values.\n2. We are not even sure if the output can be described by the input.\n\n**Potential Strategies for Improvement:**\n\n1. Increase the sample size by collecting more data points.\n2.

Therefore, I do only optimization/operations research stuff. Somehow my job title inside the company is Data Scientist. My level is Medior.\n\nI really like my job, but after some years I feel like I could try something new. I would like to learn more about machine learning (ML), not only because it is a really hot topic, but also because, whenever I could \"play\" with it for some minor personal projects, I was always fascinated by the results, so it feels like something I would like to do. Moreover, I feel like I'm hitting the limit on what I can learn on operations research and I also don't see too many optimization jobs out there. I am also turning 31 this year and I feel that the more I wait to start working on ML, the more difficult it will get, with more and more younger minds graduating with ML-specific degrees.(BTW, yes, I know, ML is a big field and it has a lot of tools inside it; I do not know yet specifically in which sector I would like to work on.)\n\nUnfortunately, at my current position I do not have the opportunity to work on anything related to ML. In my company we do have some projects on ML, and more will be started soon, so I could have a chat with my manager and see if I can work on any of them, if they allow me to spend time on learning the tools I have to use first. However, I am also considering jobs in other companies (since mine pays less than the market average), but whenever I search for \"Data Scientist\" jobs, for NON junior positions, they of course require multiple years of experience in ML. I am not willing to be \"downgraded\" from medior to junior just for the sake of working on ML; I don't mind another, better paying, medior position though. However, I am not sure any company would hire me for a ML job for a non junior position if I almost know nothing about it.\n\nWhat's your experience? Has any of you been in a similar situation and managed to get a non entry level job in ML without having too much knowledge about it? Do you think I still have a chance to switch to ML, or should I do \"all in\" on operations research/optimization? Thanks in advance for any reply!\n\n(since this is career advice, I'll add some context: almost 31 years old, living in Europe, I have a PhD degree in applied math, in which I worked with different optimization methods, but again no ML)\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_sveio1xe", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Currently working as Operations Research Scientist/Optimization without doing machine learning.
