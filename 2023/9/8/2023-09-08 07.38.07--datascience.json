To clarify, I'm not seeking a complete solution from the community; rather, I'm hoping to gather a few ideas or at the very least ascertain whether it's feasible to address this issue given the data currently at our disposal. Much appreciated.\n\n**Context**: I'm employed at a company specializing in digitizing materials, each with its unique material properties that require rendering through 3D software. Achieving a realistic rendering necessitates a deeper understanding of a material's physical properties, often obtained through testing rigs. However, these testing processes and machines come at a significant cost. Hence, our aim is to estimate these values based on provided input parameters like density, manufacturing method, and material composition. I've attempted to tackle this problem using both a Random Forest Regressor model and XGBoost, but the Average Percentage Error (APE) across the nine output categories stands at a staggering 250%. Additionally, I conducted a qualitative assessment by rendering these materials in 3D engines, revealing notable discrepancies compared to materials rendered with ground truth values.\n\n**Objective**: Our primary objective is to minimize the prediction error associated with physical property estimation as much as possible. While the exact target remains uncertain, I have a strong sense that an Average Percentage Error of 250% is unacceptably high. Initially, we engaged a machine learning consulting firm, but their model performed even worse, with an APE of 450%.\n\n**Available Data**: We've gathered a limited amount of data and currently possess a dataset of 200 samples after rigorous data cleaning. Cleaning the data improved performance significantly, as it appeared that some observations in the dataset were incorrect. A plot of one of the target variables and the correlation between input and output variables here can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/eBpGeEo).\n\n**Challenges with Proposed Solution:**\n\n1. The predictions generated by our proposed solution deviate significantly from the actual values.\n2. We are not even sure if the output can be described by the input.\n\n**Potential Strategies for Improvement:**\n\n1. Increase the sample size by collecting more data points.\n2. Incorporate additional input features to enhance model performance.\n\nI've shared these details to emphasize the necessity of addressing this matter effectively. Our managers are strongly urging a resolution, so I would greatly appreciate receiving opinions and advice from a more impartial audience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nAdded the plot of the target variable before and after log transform.\n\nAdded the correlation of input and output variables\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_azejemi0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Not sure if this problem can be solved with ML.

Additionally, I conducted a qualitative assessment by rendering these materials in 3D engines, revealing notable discrepancies compared to materials rendered with ground truth values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;: Our primary objective is to minimize the prediction error associated with physical property estimation as much as possible. While the exact target remains uncertain, I have a strong sense that an Average Percentage Error of 250% is unacceptably high. Initially, we engaged a machine learning consulting firm, but their model performed even worse, with an APE of 450%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available Data&lt;/strong&gt;: We&amp;#39;ve gathered a limited amount of data and currently possess a dataset of 200 samples after rigorous data cleaning. Cleaning the data improved performance significantly, as it appeared that some observations in the dataset were incorrect. A plot of one of the target variables and the correlation between input and output variables here can be found &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/eBpGeEo\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges with Proposed Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The predictions generated by our proposed solution deviate significantly from the actual values.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are not even sure if the output can be described by the input.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Strategies for Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Increase the sample size by collecting more data points.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Incorporate additional input features to enhance model performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve shared these details to emphasize the necessity of addressing this matter effectively.
