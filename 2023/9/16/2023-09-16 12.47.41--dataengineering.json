I was doing analytics but had worked on some DS projects as well as pushed some models to prod. Now after layoff, I am again in an analytics role doing lot of dashboards along with very basic DE projects with little to no direction and have no one in the team I can learn from.\n\nWhen I started my career after my Masters I wanted a career in DS but settled for a DA offer from FAANG in the middle of the pandemic. Then when I was laid off, I had to quickly get a job and now I am again stuck in a DA role. I want to do something more technical, that\u2019s the part of my job I like the most. I don\u2019t enjoy the finding patterns part of DS so I am thinking of pivoting towards DE. I am worried that I will be bored doing same things over and over again as DE. While DS jobs have more variety I don\u2019t like when stakeholders come with very vague asks ( I haven\u2019t had this problem in my previous company as they used to answer my questions well but now my manager only speaks high levels and thinks I am a magician)\n\nSo basically I am at the fork roads of DS and DE. I want to go back to tech and make more dollars as my current financial situation is keeping me up and night and cannot focus.
