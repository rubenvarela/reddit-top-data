So I am not a complete noob. I've worked with various data processing tools like Spark, Beam, and BigQuery. However, my experience with BigQuery has mostly been for analytics purposes. In my current role, one of my primary tasks is to refactor our ETL processes in BigQuery into a more conventional programming setup. I am thinking of Scala+Spark or PySpark. The main reason - we want normal programming language. With tests, functions, etc.\n\nCost issue never was my responsibility, but now it is.\n\nTo assess the potential performance and cost implications of this transition, I decided to run some benchmarks based on our data and transformations patterns. Surprisingly, BigQuery turned out to be extremely efficient! I couldn't achieve anywhere near the same level of performance with Spark \u2013 the difference was substantial, with BigQuery taking about 50 seconds to Spark's 8 minutes. Additionally, in terms of cost, BigQuery came out significantly cheaper. BigQuery charges only for the scanned data bytes, so no matter how complex the computation, it doesn't impact the final cost much. In my benchmark, I observed something like $0.2 in BigQuery compared to $0.9 in Spark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that impressed me during my analysis is that the shuffle size in BigQuery can be up to 5 or even 10 times larger than the scanned bytes, but it's not charged.

So I am not a complete noob. I&amp;#39;ve worked with various data processing tools like Spark, Beam, and BigQuery. However, my experience with BigQuery has mostly been for analytics purposes. In my current role, one of my primary tasks is to refactor our ETL processes in BigQuery into a more conventional programming setup. I am thinking of Scala+Spark or PySpark. The main reason - we want normal programming language. With tests, functions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cost issue never was my responsibility, but now it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To assess the potential performance and cost implications of this transition, I decided to run some benchmarks based on our data and transformations patterns. Surprisingly, BigQuery turned out to be extremely efficient! I couldn&amp;#39;t achieve anywhere near the same level of performance with Spark \u2013 the difference was substantial, with BigQuery taking about 50 seconds to Spark&amp;#39;s 8 minutes. Additionally, in terms of cost, BigQuery came out significantly cheaper. BigQuery charges only for the scanned data bytes, so no matter how complex the computation, it doesn&amp;#39;t impact the final cost much. In my benchmark, I observed something like $0.2 in BigQuery compared to $0.9 in Spark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that impressed me during my analysis is that the shuffle size in BigQuery can be up to 5 or even 10 times larger than the scanned bytes, but it&amp;#39;s not charged. Moreover, the performance impact doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be as significant as I initially thought. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s baffling to me is how they achieved such remarkable performance and usability in BigQuery.

That was a about a year ago.\n\nMy second and current employer is a mid-sized product company. I also joined as DA, in an \"analytics\" team which primarily is focused on automated regular reports.

My managers heard that I liked the \"technical\" side so I was primarily given such tasks - scripts, managing the internal team server, moving stuff from crontab to Airflow, refactoring old scripts, writing a \"git guide\" for people on the team, etc. I actually do not think I am the most qualified person with this, even on the team, but I seem to be the only one who wants this work as other people want to go more into ML or into business/leadership track.\n\nNow the actual situation:\n\nRecently some high-level people joined to build the \"Data organization\" across the company, started talking about reorganizing and they had the perspective of \"data analysts create requirements, data engineers create and ship solutions\". They hired a team of data engineers in one of our Asia offices - these guys are quite closed and I cannot switch there. I saw the danger and asked my managers to make me an Analytics Engineer to make sure I don't get stuck in the business-facing role again.

I recently started reading Kleppmann but the idea that at some point I will have to actually use that knowledge about what database replicates using a master or using a quorum, and that production will depend on it, scares me.\n\nWhat maybe scares me even more is that because of the \"analysts are not engineers\" perspective the team does not have a tech lead.

I like the work, and I do not want to go back to &amp;quot;business side&amp;quot;, but I feel like I am going toward a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And thank you if you read through all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "169e9tj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "yetanotherfakede", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/169e9tj/da_ended_up_with_a_de_title_i_want_to_live_up_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/169e9tj/da_ended_up_with_a_de_title_i_want_to_live_up_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 126775, "created_utc": 1693790628.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "I'm looking to connect specially marketing related APIs such as Google Ads, GA4, Instagram Insights, Instagram Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, Youtube API, Pinterest Ads, etc and ideally push a copy of the data into a PostgreSQL hosted on AWS, GCP or worst case Azure.\n\nThe ultimate idea is that I want to pull the data from these marketing APIs and have near real time dashboards created with Superset (I already have my Superset instance set up and working).\n\nHowever, my mains skills are related to data analytics and some cloud infrastructure, not data engineering per se, therefore I can't write ad hoc code to connect to each API by myself.\n\nSo far I've researched about [nocodeapi.com](https://nocodeapi.com), Airbyte Open Source, [Singer.io](https://Singer.io) and [integrate](https://integrate.io).io, which I'll be testing during the week and sharing my findings.", "author_fullname": "t2_yikhi", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Can you recommend an open source (or low cost software) that enables connecting to APIs without code or low code?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_169eq5i", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Help", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1693791963.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking to connect specially marketing related APIs such as Google Ads, GA4, Instagram Insights, Instagram Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, Youtube API, Pinterest Ads, etc and ideally push a copy of the data into a PostgreSQL hosted on AWS, GCP or worst case Azure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ultimate idea is that I want to pull the data from these marketing APIs and have near real time dashboards created with Superset (I already have my Superset instance set up and working).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, my mains skills are related to data analytics and some cloud infrastructure, not data engineering per se, therefore I can&amp;#39;t write ad hoc code to connect to each API by myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve researched about &lt;a href=\"https://nocodeapi.com\"&gt;nocodeapi.com&lt;/a&gt;, Airbyte Open Source, &lt;a href=\"https://Singer.io\"&gt;Singer.io&lt;/a&gt;
