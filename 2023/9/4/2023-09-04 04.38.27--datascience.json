I want to work with data but my long term goal is to start my own business where I can use my previous knowledge and connections from any of these careers to grow my business, basically just leveraging on what I learnt before. I initially considered Data Science as the career that lets me work with stakeholders and business folks and thus introduces me to metrics and factors the managers or other higher personnel consider more valuable. However, it's not a hidden fact that Data Scientist is not particularly an entry-level job (same can possibly be said for Data Engineer but it is a lot more defined and easier to get into than a Data Scientist role). Just going through a list of jobs in both fields on LinkedIn, I find more Data Engineering jobs from good companies that require reasonable amount of experience and expertise than Data Science, where you have to know ML, DL, distributed databases and a heck of a lot more for an \"entry-level job\". Thus, my plan is to get a job as soon as possible so that I can get enough financial resources for my own business. I might possibly consider working as Data Scientist too (if I choose DE) considering I will be pursuing a masters in Computer Science in the future.

If so, what would be the requirements?\n\nAs a side note, I'm not getting in this career path solely for the money, though.

I learned everything needed in university courses (R, Python, SQL, stats, Excel, Tableau, etc) and now I&amp;#39;m starting my career as a DS here. Our economy is completely broken, salaries are trash compared to the rest of the world. A senior DS can aspire to make maybe $24k/year locally at the very best. More typical salaries range between $8k-$16k/year, and $4k/year for entry level (yes, really).\nSo even though I&amp;#39;m just starting, I find the question of the title extremely important since it&amp;#39;s gonna fuel my motivation for my career. With that said I have a few questions I hope you can answer:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) How common is it for companies to hire people/other companies to do contractor work for DS/DA?\n2) Is the legal aspect of it a huge barrier?\n3) All in all, is it feasible to aim to gather some years of experience in the field locally and then work as a contractor for US companies, to earn a US wage?\n4) Are there other ways to work for a US company than as a contractor?\n5) [Extra] Is there any chance I could land an entry level DS job working from abroad? If so, what would be the requirements?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I&amp;#39;m not getting in this career path solely for the money, though. I found out I loved stats and numbers in general while doing my bachelor&amp;#39;s and I don&amp;#39;t see myself working in a different field. But of course, having that big financial goal in mind of one day earning a US wage fires me up a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this post doesn&amp;#39;t come along as if I&amp;#39;m trying to get ahead of myself or as extremely ignorant. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "169fo6q", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Frandavsan", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/169fo6q/can_i_aim_to_work_in_the_field_as_a_contractor/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/169fo6q/can_i_aim_to_work_in_the_field_as_a_contractor/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1029737, "created_utc": 1693794661.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
