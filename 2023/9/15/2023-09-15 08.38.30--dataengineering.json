Now I got hired because I have done labor work for them in the past and have a good relationship with them. I am currently going to school concentrating in Information Systems and did some light analytical work through my classes. So this past summer I  pitched them a project that leveraged their data and showed them that they can create value through that.\n\nWhen they accepted and I got access to their \"data,\" it was all Excel, Word, etc. files loosely organized in Onedrive; an ERP system that I didn't have access to; and an employee time tracker. As I am sure you guys know, small construction (or blue-collar) businesses tend to have little to no data infrastructure. I quickly realized that compiling this data would be a nightmare. Despite this, I used my Python and SQL knowledge to create a project. (The goal of the project was to show how the energy output of solar panels was affected by weather patterns).\n\nAnyway, they really liked the project and want to take it to the next level. But simply throwing everything in a SQL server is not a long-term solution.\n\nTherefore, I have been tasked to develop a stack from the ground up. This is very much out of my wheelhouse.\n\nThrough my limited research, I have been thinking of going from Data Factory to ADLS to maybe Synapse? My company wants to keep it in the Microsoft environment. Now after talking with some people online, they have mentioned that maybe I should first put everything in ADLS? For example, the company files are all on Teams. Our time tracking software is from a third-party provider, etc. And putting everything in ADLS makes it easier to work with later on?\n\nBasically what I want to ask is, how screwed am I?? And secondly, if anyone can help guide me.\n\nNote:\n\n1. I don't want to tell them that I can't do it, cause then I'm completely useless at the company.\n2. Throughout the summer I've realized that I actually enjoy working in a data role so I really want to learn how everything works. I want to look at this project as an opportunity to learn as I want to eventually become a data engineer, but without a Computer Science background, it seems overwhelming.\n3. I have done two projects that I followed on YouTube using Azure and have gotten a decent overview of what a basic modern stack looks like.\n4. We do not have an IT department, nor are they thinking of getting one anytime soon. I am the only person.\n5.

Now I got hired because I have done labor work for them in the past and have a good relationship with them. I am currently going to school concentrating in Information Systems and did some light analytical work through my classes. So this past summer I  pitched them a project that leveraged their data and showed them that they can create value through that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they accepted and I got access to their &amp;quot;data,&amp;quot; it was all Excel, Word, etc. files loosely organized in Onedrive; an ERP system that I didn&amp;#39;t have access to; and an employee time tracker. As I am sure you guys know, small construction (or blue-collar) businesses tend to have little to no data infrastructure. I quickly realized that compiling this data would be a nightmare. Despite this, I used my Python and SQL knowledge to create a project. (The goal of the project was to show how the energy output of solar panels was affected by weather patterns).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, they really liked the project and want to take it to the next level. But simply throwing everything in a SQL server is not a long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I have been tasked to develop a stack from the ground up. This is very much out of my wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through my limited research, I have been thinking of going from Data Factory to ADLS to maybe Synapse? My company wants to keep it in the Microsoft environment. Now after talking with some people online, they have mentioned that maybe I should first put everything in ADLS? For example, the company files are all on Teams. Our time tracking software is from a third-party provider, etc. And putting everything in ADLS makes it easier to work with later on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically what I want to ask is, how screwed am I?? And secondly, if anyone can help guide me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to tell them that I can&amp;#39;t do it, cause then I&amp;#39;m completely useless at the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Throughout the summer I&amp;#39;ve realized that I actually enjoy working in a data role so I really want to learn how everything works. I want to look at this project as an opportunity to learn as I want to eventually become a data engineer, but without a Computer Science background, it seems overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have done two projects that I followed on YouTube using Azure and have gotten a decent overview of what a basic modern stack looks like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We do not have an IT department, nor are they thinking of getting one anytime soon.
