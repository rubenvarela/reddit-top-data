Much appreciated.\n\n**Context**: I'm employed at a company specializing in digitizing materials, each with its unique material properties that require rendering through 3D software. Achieving a realistic rendering necessitates a deeper understanding of a material's physical properties, often obtained through testing rigs. However, these testing processes and machines come at a significant cost. Hence, our aim is to estimate these values based on provided input parameters like density, manufacturing method, and material composition. I've attempted to tackle this problem using both a Random Forest Regressor model and XGBoost, but the Average Percentage Error (APE) across the nine output categories stands at a staggering 250%.

While the exact target remains uncertain, I have a strong sense that an Average Percentage Error of 250% is unacceptably high. Initially, we engaged a machine learning consulting firm, but their model performed even worse, with an APE of 450%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Available Data: We&amp;#39;ve gathered a limited amount of data and currently possess a dataset of 200 samples after rigorous data cleaning. Cleaning the data improved performance significantly, as it appeared that some observations in the dataset were incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges with Proposed Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The predictions generated by our proposed solution deviate significantly from the actual values.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are not even sure if the output can be described by the input.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Strategies for Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Increase the sample size by collecting more data points.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Incorporate additional input features to enhance model performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve shared these details to emphasize the necessity of addressing this matter effectively. Our managers are strongly urging a resolution, so I would greatly appreciate receiving opinions and advice from a more impartial audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "937a6f50-d780-11e7-826d-0ed1beddcc82", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "16cbtjd", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "External_Oven_6379", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/16cbtjd/not_sure_if_this_problem_can_be_solved_with_ml/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16cbtjd/not_sure_if_this_problem_can_be_solved_with_ml/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1034944, "created_utc": 1694080858.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience studying Data Science and maybe get some advice.\n\nI'm a Psychologist and graduated last year.\n\nWhile getting my degree, I got super into research, which kept me motivated to do well in my studies.
