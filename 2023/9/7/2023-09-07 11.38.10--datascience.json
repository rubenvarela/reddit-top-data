To clarify, I'm not seeking a complete solution from the community; rather, I'm hoping to gather a few ideas or at the very least ascertain whether it's feasible to address this issue given the data currently at our disposal. Much appreciated.\n\n**Context**: I'm employed at a company specializing in digitizing materials, each with its unique material properties that require rendering through 3D software. Achieving a realistic rendering necessitates a deeper understanding of a material's physical properties, often obtained through testing rigs. However, these testing processes and machines come at a significant cost. Hence, our aim is to estimate these values based on provided input parameters like density, manufacturing method, and material composition. I've attempted to tackle this problem using both a Random Forest Regressor model and XGBoost, but the Average Percentage Error (APE) across the nine output categories stands at a staggering 250%. Additionally, I conducted a qualitative assessment by rendering these materials in 3D engines, revealing notable discrepancies compared to materials rendered with ground truth values.\n\n**Objective**: Our primary objective is to minimize the prediction error associated with physical property estimation as much as possible. While the exact target remains uncertain, I have a strong sense that an Average Percentage Error of 250% is unacceptably high. Initially, we engaged a machine learning consulting firm, but their model performed even worse, with an APE of 450%.\n\nAvailable Data: We've gathered a limited amount of data and currently possess a dataset of 200 samples after rigorous data cleaning.

I had pretty good grades (my final average was 9.07 out of 10), and I colaborated with some researchers. Some of my work was published in ongresses, and right now, I&amp;#39;m writing two papers. All this makes me think I have good options for starting a PhD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year, I got a job at my university in a department where I analyze psychological data using R and Python (mostly R) . I also started a two-year master&amp;#39;s in data science. It&amp;#39;s pretty heavy on statistics, math, and programming in general. I think that&amp;#39;s a good thing because it means I&amp;#39;ll have skills that could be useful in a lot of places. I&amp;#39;m doing okay with the coursework and enjoy it. The research I did before is also kind of related to data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I worry about the future. With how fast AI and stuff like ChatGPT are growing, by the time I finish my master&amp;#39;s, a lot of jobs might be automated, and maybe my skills won&amp;#39;t be as valuable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before starting the master&amp;#39;s, I was thinking about two paths. One was looking for a job in the data field as a data scientist. The other was mixing psychology with data science in a PhD. But now, I&amp;#39;m not so sure because of how I feel about the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any opinion on this :))&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "16btgj3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Environmental-Pen499", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/16btgj3/unmotivated_data_science_research_in_psychology/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16btgj3/unmotivated_data_science_research_in_psychology/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1034861, "created_utc": 1694028533.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_74100cyzx", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Vertex AI and the ML Workflow", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_16bpbuf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QuvPUscW6_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
