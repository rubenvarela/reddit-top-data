We're under $40/tb now on the low-end. And realistically, unless HDD prices fall in kind in the coming year - it's starts to look pretty attractive for more bulk-storage. \n\nSo, where my head is: I have probably a year or 2 left on my current server until I need to start thinking about adding more capacity to the thing. I'm beginning to think about next steps. But seriously considering flash.\n\nWhich brings me to my question: What sort of considerations / configs would be appropriate when entertaining all-flash storage? My goals are:\n\n- Easy to expand. With storage getting cheaper and cheaper by the month, doesn't make sense to buy all the storage at once. Only buy what I need, and offload future expansion for when drives are cheaper/higher capacity.\n\n- Reasonably performant. I run 10 gig networking and tend to keep very little data on my local machines. Data isn't specific to any one computer. Can log onto anything and resume my work. So, something that could utilize that network speed.\n\n- Separate compute and storage. My current setup is monolithic - everything in one chassis. But I want to move away from that model with the sort of  generational hardware improvements we've seen in recent years. \n\n- I want to keep storage-related hardware costs as low as possible. If compute and storage are separated, then I want to minimize the cost of said storage.\n\n\nJust brain dumping here....\n\nI had looked at ceph and gluster for a distributed storage. No single failure point, can add bricks/osds as needed for expansion. But I have some concerns about how well the things perform on lower end hardware like a pi or even odroid. I can't seem to find much info on scaling over a bunch of slower \"1 gig\"  nodes.\n\n2.5\" jbod chassis are neat. ZFS mirrors to expand? Looks fairly performant, even if the parity-overhead is rather high.\n\nNot sure what else is there, or what makes sense.

We&amp;#39;re under $40/tb now on the low-end. And realistically, unless HDD prices fall in kind in the coming year - it&amp;#39;s starts to look pretty attractive for more bulk-storage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, where my head is: I have probably a year or 2 left on my current server until I need to start thinking about adding more capacity to the thing. I&amp;#39;m beginning to think about next steps. But seriously considering flash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my question: What sort of considerations / configs would be appropriate when entertaining all-flash storage? My goals are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy to expand. With storage getting cheaper and cheaper by the month, doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to buy all the storage at once. Only buy what I need, and offload future expansion for when drives are cheaper/higher capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasonably performant. I run 10 gig networking and tend to keep very little data on my local machines. Data isn&amp;#39;t specific to any one computer. Can log onto anything and resume my work. So, something that could utilize that network speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate compute and storage. My current setup is monolithic - everything in one chassis. But I want to move away from that model with the sort of  generational hardware improvements we&amp;#39;ve seen in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to keep storage-related hardware costs as low as possible. If compute and storage are separated, then I want to minimize the cost of said storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just brain dumping here....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had looked at ceph and gluster for a distributed storage. No single failure point, can add bricks/osds as needed for expansion. But I have some concerns about how well the things perform on lower end hardware like a pi or even odroid. I can&amp;#39;t seem to find much info on scaling over a bunch of slower &amp;quot;1 gig&amp;quot;  nodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.5&amp;quot; jbod chassis are neat. ZFS mirrors to expand? Looks fairly performant, even if the parity-overhead is rather high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure what else is there, or what makes sense.

I was considering creating a RAIDz2 cluster first, transfering the data and then increasing it to a RAIDz3 cluster, but it&amp;#39;s a bit vague (or rather, I don&amp;#39;t really understand) if this is possible or not. Also, I&amp;#39;m a bit worried that during a period of time, the data will only exist in one place. If anyone has any advice here, I&amp;#39;d appreciate it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Will a RAIDz3 vdev be scaleable? So I can add another drive to increase the storage space easily?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Has anyone experience in using SSDs as cache for the pool? I have some laying around, would be nice to use as cache memory.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use Ubuntu 20.04 (currently), but will probably upgrade before transitioning. I also have an UPS (simple version) with surge protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate any advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "129gp44", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "snattack_", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/129gp44/redesigning_my_nas_storage_solution_needs_advice/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/129gp44/redesigning_my_nas_storage_solution_needs_advice/", "subreddit_subscribers": 676472, "created_utc": 1680429510.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hi All, I have roughly +80TB of data being stored across several TrueNAS Core servers.

Both can hold 4 HDDs and actually the cheaper one can do 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch and cloning while the expensive one can only do 3.5 inch and no cloning, so why is the second one double the price? Are all desktop HDDs 3.5 inch including the easystore HDDs so either would work right? The more expensive one comes with a fan and the \\~$200 4 bay one comes with a 90mm fan so I would probably just get the \\~$250 5 bay option to get the 120mm fan for easier replacement/quietness.

Both can hold 4 HDDs and actually the cheaper one can do 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch and cloning while the expensive one can only do 3.5 inch and no cloning, so why is the second one double the price? Are all desktop HDDs 3.5 inch including the easystore HDDs so either would work right? The more expensive one comes with a fan and the ~$200 4 bay one comes with a 90mm fan so I would probably just get the ~$250 5 bay option to get the 120mm fan for easier replacement/quietness.

The downloads were always a bit slow, especially when America was up and alive, and would speed up when it was morning to afternoon here in Aus, so I always just assumed it was bandwidth on IA's end.

More annoyingly, it seems to get roughly that far, and then give me a network error, meaning I have to completely restart my download from scratch. It's done that 3 times now over 4-5 days, and I'm losing it lol\n\nI've heard IA has a bandwidth limit per user, and that downloading their downloader makes downloads faster, but then I also can't find the downloader anywhere, even when I search for it, though that's likely on me lol\n\nIf anyone has any ideas at all, that would be awesome.
