I then had 2 postdocs within the same field of my PhD. Before anyone gets the wrong idea, my PhD and postdocs had nothing to do with bioinformatics and more to do with using applied mathematics to build theories on evolutionary biology. However, academia, at least in biology, is slowly becoming unsustainable and unfriendly to everyone unwilling to dedicate 110% of their lives (including their personal life) to it, so I left.\n\nI got hired by a marketing consultancy company. Briefly, I got hired because I showed that I could analyse data and offer hypotheses on improving a fictional company's product marketing. One of the co-founders got very excited because they are enthusiastic about machine learning and AI, despite having no technical knowledge. I made it clear from the start that even though I love learning new stuff and analysing data, I have 0 knowledge of machine learning. They said that was fair enough and, that I had time to acquire that knowledge, that the company would help where they could. In the meantime, I could use what I already knew. The company is very small, so only one person is data inclined. Their knowledge is more on interacting with databases and less on extracting patterns and analysing data.\n\nSo, less than 1 month ago, I started the job. So far, I am thrilled with it. As the co-founder said, they are giving me time to adjust, to learn new stuff.

I then had 2 postdocs within the same field of my PhD. Before anyone gets the wrong idea, my PhD and postdocs had nothing to do with bioinformatics and more to do with using applied mathematics to build theories on evolutionary biology. However, academia, at least in biology, is slowly becoming unsustainable and unfriendly to everyone unwilling to dedicate 110% of their lives (including their personal life) to it, so I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got hired by a marketing consultancy company. Briefly, I got hired because I showed that I could analyse data and offer hypotheses on improving a fictional company&amp;#39;s product marketing. One of the co-founders got very excited because they are enthusiastic about machine learning and AI, despite having no technical knowledge. I made it clear from the start that even though I love learning new stuff and analysing data, I have 0 knowledge of machine learning. They said that was fair enough and, that I had time to acquire that knowledge, that the company would help where they could. In the meantime, I could use what I already knew. The company is very small, so only one person is data inclined. Their knowledge is more on interacting with databases and less on extracting patterns and analysing data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, less than 1 month ago, I started the job.

And we have a few different characteristics to consider:\n\n1. Ad Format - video ads vs audio ads (basically what it sounds like - video ad plays a 15s clip, an audio ad plays just an audio ad for 15s)\n2. Content Type - home page vs discover feed\n3. Free users vs Premium - previously video ads only existed on the home page and not discover feed; previously no premium users got ads, but now premium users will get video ads on the discover feed\n\nHow should I approach designing this test and doing sample sizing?
