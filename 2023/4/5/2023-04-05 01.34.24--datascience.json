I\u2019ve been in the field for 5 years now as a data scientist so I commented that I\u2019d be happy to have a chat. A lot of people actually DMd me asking for more info so I figured I\u2019d make a post about it.\n\n# What is People Analytics (PA)\n\nHR departments usually have dedicated groups focusing on Compensation, Benefits, Talent Acquisition, Diversity and Inclusion and so on.\n\nAll those departments usually have a lot of data but do very little with it analytically. A lot of the work done is more of a reporting nature, and if any analytics is done it\u2019s usually very basic or uses a third party consulting firm for benchmarking and what not.\n\nThe idea of people analytics is simply doing actual analytics on this data. It does no necessarily mean data science and machine learning though. In most cases, the org simply does not have enough headcount to do that. Thanks fully I\u2019ve worked mostly with large orgs and have had the opportunity to do a lot of machine learning work there given that they have sufficient data.\n\nBut regardless of whether ML is involved or not, it is about doing valuable analytics to generate insights about your workforce. I\u2019ve listed some example projects further down in this post.\n\n# Pros &amp; Cons\n\n## Pros:\n\nThis field allows you to generate actual business value and work with very interesting data. Everything regarding the workforce can be linked back to a monetary value of some sort. For example, Turnover can be linked to the cost of recruitment and hiring, so by providing ways to reduce turnover, you provide ways to reduce cost to the organization. So you can become very valuable to your organization.\n\nAdditionally, it is also growing very fast. HR is archaic and really lacks behind in terms of analytics. Companies are realizing this and trying to act on it. I get a lot of recruiters reach out to me on LinkedIn for a DS position on a new PA team.\n\n## Cons:\n\nThe data science ceiling is low, mostly because of the data. I have worked with large organizations with 50,000+ employees. So in those cases I can run a variety of models because my sample size is good. But most companies are not that big. You will struggle to build meaningful models when your company only has 1000-5000 employees mainly because most analyses will be focus on a subset of that full population, further reducing your sample size.\n\nSo this is not a field where you'll have a ton of opportunity to work a lot with deep learning, or anything more advanced than GLMs or boosted models. Your audience is also highly likely not technical, so the methodology you use has to be easily explainable.\n\nAnother big issue is the fact that a lot of people-data-based ML models will have poor performance. This is mostly because you try to model something behavioral, without the necessary data. For example, predicting turnover - whether someone leaves an org or not is very rarely captured by just their pay and job characteristics. There are a lot of behavioral and qualitative factors that are just not available in your data.\n\nSo your model is sub optimal, but the business still expects answers. So you have to be able to understand how to work with such models, and how to best manage expectations and derive feasible outcomes.\n\n# ML Project Examples\n\n## Pay Equity\n\nThe first very common project is pay equity - are employees being discriminated against on the basis of gender, age or race? This is usually just a multiple regression problem where you attempt to build a model that replicates the organizations pay philosophy and attempt to predict pay for every employee. You can then add in variables like gender and race and determine if there is a discrepancy and if it is statically significant. These types of projects are heavily legally regulated so you have very little to no flexibility in your approach.\n\nThese types of projects also shed light on whether the organizations pay philosophy is observed in practice and can pinpoint employees who are underpaid or overpaid relative to expectations. Overall it generates a lot of very good insights for the organization that isn\u2019t just pay equity. and of course, part of the analysis is providing a strategic budget adjustment to remediate any pay inequity across the company.\n\nPay equity projects are very common now given recent legislature changes in the U.S. and is the cash cow of many consulting firms.\n\n## Turnover Modeling\n\nUsing HR data such as job and personal characteristics, compensation, survey data and so on to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization.\n\nThis can also shed some light onto what factors can drive turnover and help identify turnover hotspots in the organization. These analyses are rarely accurate at an individual level, but aggregated at a higher level can be pretty powerful.\n\nThe biggest impact from these analyses come from using those drivers and creating some scenario modeling to identify cost saving opportunities.\n\n## Job Architecture\n\nA job architecture is the structure that identifies the various levels and distinction between each job. This is typically a combination of \u201cgrade\u201d or \u201clevel\u201d at your organization and job family.\n\nUsually this is done in a very qualitative and extremely tedious way. But we have recently come up with an NLP driven approach in which we identify a similarity score based on each job title and business characteristics associated with each title. We then apply a clustering methodology to create groups of similar jobs. Further analyses can be applied to these groups.\n\n## Other Root Cause Analyses\n\nI\u2019ve worked on a slew of other projects that were very similar in nature. They would revolve around predicting one thing for employees (I.e., performance, engagement, overtime hours) and using the drivers to generate insights regarding that metric as well as cost saving opportunities.\n\n## Salesman Evaluation\n\nThis can be applied to a variety of roles but I\u2019ve seen it used predominantly on sales roles given their direct business impact.\n\nEssentially we attempt to predict in a given quarter/timeframe someone\u2019s sales performance. What differs from the root causes projects I\u2019ve mentioned above is that we usually work with some research team to design a very specific survey.\n\nThe questions to those surveys are designed to help us gain a much more comprehensive understanding of what behavioral factor matters the most for sales roles and we\u2019ve applied these insights to the hiring and developmental processes of these sales roles.\n\n# Concluding Thoughts\n\nSo I hope this is helpful for anyone interested in doing analytics in HR. Personally I think its a great field to start in, but not necessarily to make a career out of. I'm personally looking to transition away from it now.\n\nIt provided me with a lot of opportunities to do meaningful and impactful data science, but ultimately the DS ceiling is limited.", "author_fullname": "t2_1eoopt", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Data Science in HR - People Analytics", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_12bseqo", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 59, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 59, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1680633960.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Preface&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some time ago a redditor posted on this sub asking for advice regarding a people analytics data science role.

I&amp;#39;m personally looking to transition away from it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It provided me with a lot of opportunities to do meaningful and impactful data science, but ultimately the DS ceiling is limited.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "12bseqo", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "scun1995", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/12bseqo/data_science_in_hr_people_analytics/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/12bseqo/data_science_in_hr_people_analytics/", "subreddit_subscribers": 867748, "created_utc": 1680633960.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I've been working the last three years at a consulting firm as a Data Scientist.

Getting additional data is not an option.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sure that you data scientists have found yourselves in this position many times, but how do you push back without making yourself seem like a negative person?  I personally have tried pushing back to my boss but it is falling on deaf ears and hurting my career.  I\u2019m also pushing the data scientist as I am \u201cleading the project\u201d but I feel like they are getting pissed at me too.  It doesn\u2019t seem like their boss will ever push back on my boss which is what I\u2019ve been waiting to happen for months now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So any advice you can offer is much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "12c1ath", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mythirdredditname", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/12c1ath/help_me_help_my_data_scientist/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/12c1ath/help_me_help_my_data_scientist/", "subreddit_subscribers": 867748, "created_utc": 1680652257.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
