However I am thinking   about other areas in tech I can pivot towards. The reason I chose to go   down the data science path was because at the time, data science was   touted as having a lot of demand, and also I found it interesting and I   did really well in an undergrad paper I took for it (which made me want   to specialise and select it as my major). However after entering the  job  market, and working for a few years, I came to realise there aren't really any quality roles for data science (note I am in the  Australia/NZ  region), and most roles are just glorified analyst  positions. Don't get  me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being an  analyst, but I don't  particularly like just building dashboards all  day. Or worse, working  with excel (or other analysts' excels, which due  to poor workflows can  be an absolute mess). I also don't like  \"insights\" - I like  investigating and coming up with evidence-based  conclusions and  recommendations, but often this is not what  stakeholders are after, they  are after \"storytelling with data\" to  razzle-dazzle them and prop up  what they were already planning on doing  in the first place. I did get  to build and deploy some machine  learning models however, which I  enjoyed, but there isn't much demand  for it (which is understandable, I  fully get that companies want to  focus on things that add business  value).\n\nSo  now I'm thinking about  other roles I might be considered/eligible for.  I have applied for  entry-level data engineering roles as that is a  related job family, but  have not been successful with any as I think  recruiters probably think I  have too much experience and am too old. I  am not sure whether that  would also be the case for cybersecurity and  whether it's worth trying  to go down this path? I know nothing is  certain in this life, but would  really appreciate some honest opinions  before spending time and money  trying to do certifications etc. If I  did try to pivot towards this area  I would like to build up my  knowledge and skills on the technical side  (as I think this is really  important), but would want to try to get into GRC roles.\n\nAnd  why cyber?

However I am thinking   about other areas in tech I can pivot towards. The reason I chose to go   down the data science path was because at the time, data science was   touted as having a lot of demand, and also I found it interesting and I   did really well in an undergrad paper I took for it (which made me want   to specialise and select it as my major). However after entering the  job  market, and working for a few years, I came to realise there aren&amp;#39;t really any quality roles for data science (note I am in the  Australia/NZ  region), and most roles are just glorified analyst  positions. Don&amp;#39;t get  me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being an  analyst, but I don&amp;#39;t  particularly like just building dashboards all  day. Or worse, working  with excel (or other analysts&amp;#39; excels, which due  to poor workflows can  be an absolute mess). I also don&amp;#39;t like  &amp;quot;insights&amp;quot; - I like  investigating and coming up with evidence-based  conclusions and  recommendations, but often this is not what  stakeholders are after, they  are after &amp;quot;storytelling with data&amp;quot; to  razzle-dazzle them and prop up  what they were already planning on doing  in the first place. I did get  to build and deploy some machine  learning models however, which I  enjoyed, but there isn&amp;#39;t much demand  for it (which is understandable, I  fully get that companies want to  focus on things that add business  value).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So  now I&amp;#39;m thinking about  other roles I might be considered/eligible for.  I have applied for  entry-level data engineering roles as that is a  related job family, but  have not been successful with any as I think  recruiters probably think I  have too much experience and am too old. I  am not sure whether that  would also be the case for cybersecurity and  whether it&amp;#39;s worth trying  to go down this path? I know nothing is  certain in this life, but would  really appreciate some honest opinions  before spending time and money  trying to do certifications etc. If I  did try to pivot towards this area  I would like to build up my  knowledge and skills on the technical side  (as I think this is really  important), but would want to try to get into GRC roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  why cyber? I think  it&amp;#39;s a really interesting area, and it suits my  analytical and  investigative mindset. I have also been working in  Financial Services,  which is a heavily regulated industry, so I am  familiar with risk  management concepts and practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would   really appreciate any thoughts, even if it&amp;#39;s to say it&amp;#39;s too late to change and to stick with Data &amp;amp; Analytics.

I was hired quite quickly, while studying pre-med, to be a business intelligence engineer at a regional bank, per the recommendation of another employee who was a classmate of mine and was familiar with my extensive programming background. After a year of being there doing ETL, software engineering, and other data engineering functions, my mentor, the BI Architect stormed out of the office after being refuse a LoA to care for sick family in India. I was then promoted to her role where I stayed for another 3 years. During my time there I would routinely be called a child and was denied a raise or bonus every year because \"you're just a college student. The quality of your work and workload don't matter. You should be thankful I'd even employ someone your age at a position that reports directly to the CFO\". I took it in stride, but I was only getting $50k. The people who worked under me as BI engineers were getting 100-150 each with significantly less work, less executive visibility, and zero  need for making regular presentations to the Board of Directors, like I did. Eventually I grew tired of the abuse. I was working 60 hour weeks while taking between 24-29 credit hours at Uni. I was literally signed into work and working through class, getting up early every day, weekday or weekend, to run data loads and make sure they were accurate even though I'd automated it all and automated validation. My boss demanded I do it. This was my role when I was an engineer and the architect did not do it, yet even after I was promoted and new engineers were hired, he still made me do it.  \n\n\nI was then poached by a pair of small business sister companies That 4 of my friends from Uni worked at. I was offered a 50% raise. I was conflicted about doing it, but resentful for how I was treated. I told my boss about it and he said he wouldn't match the salary and to leave. That night I got a call on my personal cell from the CFO who said if I stayed, he'd double my salary, ensure I was never called a child again, and would received raises and bonuses as my work qualified me for. Unfortunately, I didn't believe him and had already accepted the new job. I then became the Director of Development at one company and the Database Architect at the other. I quickly found out that the job I was hired for wasn't at all what I was told it'd be and ended up having to trash a massive amount of my predecessor's work, which was completely unusable. Entirely on my own, I created a JavaScript framework to suit my needs and wrote a complex web application, Node.JS backend, and a set of iOS/Android/Windows apps using the Microsoft UWP, as well as the necessary underlying database. Everything was tested thoroughly and documented not only inside the code, but in the AzureDevOps wiki where I also kept my repos. This took me a year and a half to do as I had no web development experience, much less web apps, and I had to program extremely complex mathematics like Rasch analytics that was used for objectively assessing a student in any field, on any criteria, using pre-input questions, and a set of multiple choice answers. It was primarily a medical research company, as was the sister company. At the sister company, I consolidated their 9 individual MySQL DBs into 3 and gave them a prod, test, and dev environment, which they didn't have as they did everything in prod.\n\n5 minutes after deploying all my work, which was months ahead of schedule, I was called into the owners office and fired for \"missing all deadlines\". I was in tears, but didn't fight back, collected my stuff and left. A bit over an hour later, I received a recording from one of my now-ex-coworkers with a 34 minute rant from the owner's wife about how she \"fired the f@gg0t and god's gonna bless the company now\". They hired an intern to replace me with zero experience. The intern promptly deleted the ADO wiki and repos, not knowing what they were, created a new environment for her to work in, the deployed the environment into dev, stage, and prod, completely wiping my work from the company. I had a copy, of course, but I didn't give it to them. They also denied me unemployment and told the unemployment office I was fired for \"being sexually aggressive with coworker\", and \"missing all my deadlines\". Since I did not mention this already, they had fired the other gay guy in the office 2 weeks before me and used the same excuse. I had never brought up my sexuality to them before, but all my coworkers had their partners over for lunch one day and of course my college friends were also friends with my boyfriend and brought him along without checking with me first, which effectively outed me and cost me my job. Back on topic, the company was sued by the unemployment office for falsifying my separation documents, as I was happy to send them the recording I was given, and the company is now long since out of business. It may well be the one time karma did anything for me in my life.\n\nI then got a job at the University I graduated from as a professor of computer science and I did that for a few years. While doing that, I was hired to be a software engineer by a consulting company. After 3 months of working there, I completed a huge project in python, creating a behavioral driven development framework. Prior to this, the company employed thousands of QA devs, all they did was write tests for business admins all day, every day. The process was complex and extremely wasteful, with the BAs writing multiple pages for each and every test. My framework condensed this process into the BAs having to only write a handful of sentences in basically plain english, saving a ton of time. Cigna was so happy, they gave me any position I wanted and I wanted to be a data architect again.\n\nCigna then put me in as the Lead Data Architect for their opioid data. I did that for a year and a half before having a fight with management. they wanted me to falsify data to help them win a lawsuit against a group of doctors. I refused, as did my team, and I ended up leaving the Cigna account. I stayed at the same consulting company and went to work for the State of Puerto Rico as the lead data architect for their disaster recovery efforts and I stayed there for 2 years. I then decided to move to Washington and got approval from everyone at the project. Unfortunately after I moved, the project then revoked my relocation authorization despite having no authority to do so. I tried to fight it as it was a clear act of retaliation for a complaint I put in, but in the end, it's at-will employment. They also attempted to deny me unemployment, which was during the covid period, and successfully did so for 1.5 years. In the end, I got before a judge and the judge sided with me, but refused to give me the bonus money that everyone else got from the state and feds. I had a court date for that money too, but they waited till 5 days before the hearing to tell me and scheduled it for when I was in Louisiana for my father's funeral. I called to reschedule and they said they did it, but turns out they didn't and the courts called me a no-show and denied me.  \n\n\nFor the next year and a half, I was unemployed despite countless apps and interviews. During that time I worked as a freelancer and a contractor. I specifically worked on COVID data. I've talked about  my work there before on this sub, but it doesn't go over well, so I'm not gonna rehash it. I picked up a lot of other temp jobs during that time, mostly working with medical data. I also went and got a MicroMasters in Machine Learning cause I felt like AI/ML was my weakest skills in the field.\n\nI then got a job at another consulting company. I mostly worked as a data architect in medical research during that time. I was then caught up in the mass layoffs.  \n\n\nSince then, I've put in quite literally thousands of applications. Sometimes I get callbacks and surges in interviews, sometimes I got months without hearing a word. I've had truly infuriating experiences with hiring managers and recruiters. For example, I had a job set up by a friend at his employer and when I talked to the recruiter, he asked about my experience with a number of different technologies. Being a microsoft shop and me being a microsoft specialist, I had significant experience with all of them. 7-12 years, depending on which one it was. The recruiter then told me things like \"well it's a shame you don't have any experience with them. We can't hire you without experience with them\".  I tried over and over to explain I do, , but I got nowhere. I had an interview with a major league baseball team recently and I was repeatedly told by the recruiters I was their top candidate. First thing out of the CTO's mouth when she she's my face is \"oh, you're just a child. You couldn't possibly have any experience.\" She made off-hand comments about my age throughout the interview. Later I was rejected for \"not having experience working without a team\" even though we addressed that in the interview where I explained multiple times that I primarily work without a team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I'm at a loss on what to do. It's infuriating. I have no black marks on my history, numerous glowing references, 6 degree (4 undergrad, 2 masters) with 3 minors and a new grad program in Music at Berklee I'm currently pursuing. I have excellent interpersonal skills (though I can come across wrong on text by accident). I've had my resume reviewed by countless professionals, who have mostly left the resume alone, as they're happy with it. Minor changes have been made in things like order and arrangements. I've been through numerous interview training programs to evaluate how I present myself and my experience. I've been told I'm doing things the way I'm supposed to, that I'm presenting myself well, as experienced, capable, as excited to to bring my experience to the team and learn new things from them. Minor changes were made here and there, but that's it.\n\nAt this point, I have to find a job in the next 5 week or I will be homeless. I'll lose my pets. I've already stopped being able to fill my cancer medications. Medicaid won't cover them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently weighed down from over $1 million in medical bills from when someone attempted to murder me for being bisexual in 2016. It left me with chronic pain problems that I have to pay for out of pocket as medicaid won't cover any pain clinics around here, nor the medications (fentanyl patches). I'm also paying the overwhelming majority of the $3200 rent for my house, plus another $600 a month in internet and utilities.

I was hired quite quickly, while studying pre-med, to be a business intelligence engineer at a regional bank, per the recommendation of another employee who was a classmate of mine and was familiar with my extensive programming background. After a year of being there doing ETL, software engineering, and other data engineering functions, my mentor, the BI Architect stormed out of the office after being refuse a LoA to care for sick family in India. I was then promoted to her role where I stayed for another 3 years. During my time there I would routinely be called a child and was denied a raise or bonus every year because &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re just a college student. The quality of your work and workload don&amp;#39;t matter. You should be thankful I&amp;#39;d even employ someone your age at a position that reports directly to the CFO&amp;quot;. I took it in stride, but I was only getting $50k. The people who worked under me as BI engineers were getting 100-150 each with significantly less work, less executive visibility, and zero  need for making regular presentations to the Board of Directors, like I did. Eventually I grew tired of the abuse. I was working 60 hour weeks while taking between 24-29 credit hours at Uni. I was literally signed into work and working through class, getting up early every day, weekday or weekend, to run data loads and make sure they were accurate even though I&amp;#39;d automated it all and automated validation. My boss demanded I do it. This was my role when I was an engineer and the architect did not do it, yet even after I was promoted and new engineers were hired, he still made me do it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was then poached by a pair of small business sister companies That 4 of my friends from Uni worked at. I was offered a 50% raise. I was conflicted about doing it, but resentful for how I was treated. I told my boss about it and he said he wouldn&amp;#39;t match the salary and to leave. That night I got a call on my personal cell from the CFO who said if I stayed, he&amp;#39;d double my salary, ensure I was never called a child again, and would received raises and bonuses as my work qualified me for. Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#39;t believe him and had already accepted the new job. I then became the Director of Development at one company and the Database Architect at the other. I quickly found out that the job I was hired for wasn&amp;#39;t at all what I was told it&amp;#39;d be and ended up having to trash a massive amount of my predecessor&amp;#39;s work, which was completely unusable. Entirely on my own, I created a JavaScript framework to suit my needs and wrote a complex web application, Node.JS backend, and a set of iOS/Android/Windows apps using the Microsoft UWP, as well as the necessary underlying database. Everything was tested thoroughly and documented not only inside the code, but in the AzureDevOps wiki where I also kept my repos. This took me a year and a half to do as I had no web development experience, much less web apps, and I had to program extremely complex mathematics like Rasch analytics that was used for objectively assessing a student in any field, on any criteria, using pre-input questions, and a set of multiple choice answers. It was primarily a medical research company, as was the sister company. At the sister company, I consolidated their 9 individual MySQL DBs into 3 and gave them a prod, test, and dev environment, which they didn&amp;#39;t have as they did everything in prod.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 minutes after deploying all my work, which was months ahead of schedule, I was called into the owners office and fired for &amp;quot;missing all deadlines&amp;quot;. I was in tears, but didn&amp;#39;t fight back, collected my stuff and left. A bit over an hour later, I received a recording from one of my now-ex-coworkers with a 34 minute rant from the owner&amp;#39;s wife about how she &amp;quot;fired the f@gg0t and god&amp;#39;s gonna bless the company now&amp;quot;. They hired an intern to replace me with zero experience. The intern promptly deleted the ADO wiki and repos, not knowing what they were, created a new environment for her to work in, the deployed the environment into dev, stage, and prod, completely wiping my work from the company. I had a copy, of course, but I didn&amp;#39;t give it to them. They also denied me unemployment and told the unemployment office I was fired for &amp;quot;being sexually aggressive with coworker&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;missing all my deadlines&amp;quot;. Since I did not mention this already, they had fired the other gay guy in the office 2 weeks before me and used the same excuse. I had never brought up my sexuality to them before, but all my coworkers had their partners over for lunch one day and of course my college friends were also friends with my boyfriend and brought him along without checking with me first, which effectively outed me and cost me my job. Back on topic, the company was sued by the unemployment office for falsifying my separation documents, as I was happy to send them the recording I was given, and the company is now long since out of business. It may well be the one time karma did anything for me in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then got a job at the University I graduated from as a professor of computer science and I did that for a few years. While doing that, I was hired to be a software engineer by a consulting company. After 3 months of working there, I completed a huge project in python, creating a behavioral driven development framework. Prior to this, the company employed thousands of QA devs, all they did was write tests for business admins all day, every day. The process was complex and extremely wasteful, with the BAs writing multiple pages for each and every test. My framework condensed this process into the BAs having to only write a handful of sentences in basically plain english, saving a ton of time. Cigna was so happy, they gave me any position I wanted and I wanted to be a data architect again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cigna then put me in as the Lead Data Architect for their opioid data. I did that for a year and a half before having a fight with management. they wanted me to falsify data to help them win a lawsuit against a group of doctors. I refused, as did my team, and I ended up leaving the Cigna account. I stayed at the same consulting company and went to work for the State of Puerto Rico as the lead data architect for their disaster recovery efforts and I stayed there for 2 years. I then decided to move to Washington and got approval from everyone at the project. Unfortunately after I moved, the project then revoked my relocation authorization despite having no authority to do so. I tried to fight it as it was a clear act of retaliation for a complaint I put in, but in the end, it&amp;#39;s at-will employment. They also attempted to deny me unemployment, which was during the covid period, and successfully did so for 1.5 years. In the end, I got before a judge and the judge sided with me, but refused to give me the bonus money that everyone else got from the state and feds. I had a court date for that money too, but they waited till 5 days before the hearing to tell me and scheduled it for when I was in Louisiana for my father&amp;#39;s funeral. I called to reschedule and they said they did it, but turns out they didn&amp;#39;t and the courts called me a no-show and denied me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next year and a half, I was unemployed despite countless apps and interviews. During that time I worked as a freelancer and a contractor. I specifically worked on COVID data. I&amp;#39;ve talked about  my work there before on this sub, but it doesn&amp;#39;t go over well, so I&amp;#39;m not gonna rehash it. I picked up a lot of other temp jobs during that time, mostly working with medical data. I also went and got a MicroMasters in Machine Learning cause I felt like AI/ML was my weakest skills in the field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then got a job at another consulting company. I mostly worked as a data architect in medical research during that time. I was then caught up in the mass layoffs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#39;ve put in quite literally thousands of applications. Sometimes I get callbacks and surges in interviews, sometimes I got months without hearing a word. I&amp;#39;ve had truly infuriating experiences with hiring managers and recruiters. For example, I had a job set up by a friend at his employer and when I talked to the recruiter, he asked about my experience with a number of different technologies. Being a microsoft shop and me being a microsoft specialist, I had significant experience with all of them. 7-12 years, depending on which one it was. The recruiter then told me things like &amp;quot;well it&amp;#39;s a shame you don&amp;#39;t have any experience with them. We can&amp;#39;t hire you without experience with them&amp;quot;.  I tried over and over to explain I do, , but I got nowhere. I had an interview with a major league baseball team recently and I was repeatedly told by the recruiters I was their top candidate. First thing out of the CTO&amp;#39;s mouth when she she&amp;#39;s my face is &amp;quot;oh, you&amp;#39;re just a child. You couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have any experience.&amp;quot; She made off-hand comments about my age throughout the interview. Later I was rejected for &amp;quot;not having experience working without a team&amp;quot; even though we addressed that in the interview where I explained multiple times that I primarily work without a team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;#39;m at a loss on what to do. It&amp;#39;s infuriating. I have no black marks on my history, numerous glowing references, 6 degree (4 undergrad, 2 masters) with 3 minors and a new grad program in Music at Berklee I&amp;#39;m currently pursuing. I have excellent interpersonal skills (though I can come across wrong on text by accident). I&amp;#39;ve had my resume reviewed by countless professionals, who have mostly left the resume alone, as they&amp;#39;re happy with it. Minor changes have been made in things like order and arrangements. I&amp;#39;ve been through numerous interview training programs to evaluate how I present myself and my experience. I&amp;#39;ve been told I&amp;#39;m doing things the way I&amp;#39;m supposed to, that I&amp;#39;m presenting myself well, as experienced, capable, as excited to to bring my experience to the team and learn new things from them. Minor changes were made here and there, but that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I have to find a job in the next 5 week or I will be homeless. I&amp;#39;ll lose my pets. I&amp;#39;ve already stopped being able to fill my cancer medications. Medicaid won&amp;#39;t cover them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently weighed down from over $1 million in medical bills from when someone attempted to murder me for being bisexual in 2016. It left me with chronic pain problems that I have to pay for out of pocket as medicaid won&amp;#39;t cover any pain clinics around here, nor the medications (fentanyl patches). I&amp;#39;m also paying the overwhelming majority of the $3200 rent for my house, plus another $600 a month in internet and utilities. My ex/roommate is supposed to split it with me evenly, but he hasn&amp;#39;t done so in at least a year, claiming I &amp;quot;owe&amp;quot; him money for this and that, but he can&amp;#39;t ever explain what it all is. I&amp;#39;m struggling. Hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going on at all. I know I have a history of kinda rolling over and taking the punches and I&amp;#39;m working on fixing that, but whatever is happening to me with these job apps is utterly beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "132o4xg", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheAngryRussoGerman", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/132o4xg/out_of_work_since_jan_2022_and_dont_understand/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/132o4xg/out_of_work_since_jan_2022_and_dont_understand/", "subreddit_subscribers": 884704, "created_utc": 1682759740.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tableau job at Citizens Bank", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_132d53l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_2t4xvh2s", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "default", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "crosspost_parent_list": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "tableau", "selftext": "Hopefully it is ok for me to share this here.\n\nI am looking to hire a Tableau expert.

But if I were still in data science, I&amp;#39;d focus on my ability to help people self serve. I think the role will split to expert data scientists who build and productionise ML models and analytics enablers who help people get more out of the tools. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is this a threat to data scientists? Or is it a productivity booster that will only make life better?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/eR03sxTzuBOUPGl7IR1BSuBo3G61FBahRWiPs4D1pWU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d6255657ba665c01ac073208d8f6b98714d909c0", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/eR03sxTzuBOUPGl7IR1BSuBo3G61FBahRWiPs4D1pWU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44988d22a410cd782c71fbd29eec28af8dad2602", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/eR03sxTzuBOUPGl7IR1BSuBo3G61FBahRWiPs4D1pWU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6a6b1710f8fbc89a564c3798c8f5ce5466e7c8e5", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/eR03sxTzuBOUPGl7IR1BSuBo3G61FBahRWiPs4D1pWU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=92fc6017e9ae0d29fc143860a926f50342ac5992", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "7w-Lf5vWCCr2zVDtHH1sueEFznvih5AQXrFPuxAt5j8"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "aaf5d8cc-d780-11e7-a4a5-0e68d01eab56", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "132cvf9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jehan_gonzales", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/132cvf9/new_chatgpt_features_and_data_science/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/132cvf9/new_chatgpt_features_and_data_science/", "subreddit_subscribers": 884704, "created_utc": 1682723775.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I did a collaborative project with Omdena recently, and I was a lead in that project.
