The other way, which I&amp;#39;m less fond of, is to run the bastion server on a VPS and have that VPN to the lab and reverse proxy traffic that way - this would be slower and introduce complexity, but at least there would be no open ports (likely use Tailscale).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone got any experience of this? I&amp;#39;m leaning towards the second option, purely due to ease of use for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should I use a VPN or expose services over WAN with a reverse proxy server and CrowdSec / Fail2Ban when sharing services with family members and friends?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort":

Custom items can also have a plural description added now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added new units of measure to better support recipes - teaspoons, tablespoons, etc. Also added &amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; symbols for units of measure, so you can automatically detect &amp;quot;tsp, tsps, tbsp, tbsps&amp;quot; appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/vabene1111\"&gt;u/vabene1111&lt;/a&gt; for the idea to integrate with Tandoor, which already provides an extensive mapping of recipes into a common format.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ndb_LtD1u46ZmDEiItzre4uloGEz6R5M_pV6caPE9GY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c44d4ab05537aced58aade99e920dac9ea502e9b", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ndb_LtD1u46ZmDEiItzre4uloGEz6R5M_pV6caPE9GY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9737ed4b03a4a5a51cf6930c595f1227a6c40fda", "width": 108, "height": 54}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ndb_LtD1u46ZmDEiItzre4uloGEz6R5M_pV6caPE9GY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0088474b50391453378d7a0479b0c6efc3eb297e", "width": 216, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ndb_LtD1u46ZmDEiItzre4uloGEz6R5M_pV6caPE9GY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4e072ba93035c43e71f931a6767a78ebdb9a6f3f", "width": 320, "height": 160}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ndb_LtD1u46ZmDEiItzre4uloGEz6R5M_pV6caPE9GY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=202d1e3015ea87101924e451f5ded80a64954d1e", "width": 640, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ndb_LtD1u46ZmDEiItzre4uloGEz6R5M_pV6caPE9GY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a2639feb33f8db56b4b7f014dbf727f944758e23", "width": 960, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ndb_LtD1u46ZmDEiItzre4uloGEz6R5M_pV6caPE9GY.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5eb58d50b0914c3eacc99c882456e58cd0a5e900", "width": 1080, "height": 540}], "variants": {}, "id": "RTYC5h0So5jLz1rIBpH3rpW9FNHQtwnko1DEBtJZ25g"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "12wxdlw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "supplychainguy", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/12wxdlw/groceries_shopping_app_update/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/12wxdlw/groceries_shopping_app_update/", "subreddit_subscribers": 243831, "created_utc": 1682298267.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "[Own Your Stream with Spooder!](https://github.com/GreySole/Spooder)\n\nSpooder is a common ground for personal bot development.

On the host itself I have NGINX running as my reverse proxy, along with serving a few native websites. I have multiple domains and automatic DNS updates for them via google DNS and a local script, let's encrypt SSL for all of them, etc. I don't really want to migrate away from this existing NGINX web proxy solution..\n\nBut the thing that's currently driving me a bit nuts about the setup is that I'd like to have access to my locally hosted docker services remotely, without the need for a VPN, and to be able to access the services all from a single sign-on/portal if possible. I understand a VPN would accomplish this but not only did that fail the \"wife test\" for me but it also only answers half my question, as I'd like to have a single web portal to access all of these disparate services. There's solutions I've tried that are fairly close but just don't meet all my criteria.\n\nSpecifically I don't want to expose all the individual services to the internet via subdomains or proxying directly (radarr.domain.com or domain.com/radarr, etc). I also don't want to access each service individually at all. I want a unified landing/splash page so that me/the wife can browse to https://bookmark.domain.com, authenticate, and from that single landing page we can access each individual resource. Authenticating into each local service after logging into this main service is probably inevitable, I can live with that.\n\nI've tried pointing subdomains at services like Organizr or Home Assistant, where I can then have iframes or bookmarks to the rest of my services... But iframes fail because I'm reaching the service over https and the iframe content is only http, which isn't allowed in modern browsers. hyperlinks fail because they are pointing to local resources while I'm not on the local network. I don't want to simply assign sub-domains to the internal services to get those iframes working because passing lets encrypt validation to get an SSL cert means that I would still need to services exposed to the internet to pass validation.\n\nThis seems like it must be a common problem so I expect there's an easy answer. I'm hoping there's a docker container that would allow what I'm looking for that I just haven't found with my google/reddit searching yet..

On the host itself I have NGINX running as my reverse proxy, along with serving a few native websites. I have multiple domains and automatic DNS updates for them via google DNS and a local script, let&amp;#39;s encrypt SSL for all of them, etc. I don&amp;#39;t really want to migrate away from this existing NGINX web proxy solution..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing that&amp;#39;s currently driving me a bit nuts about the setup is that I&amp;#39;d like to have access to my locally hosted docker services remotely, without the need for a VPN, and to be able to access the services all from a single sign-on/portal if possible. I understand a VPN would accomplish this but not only did that fail the &amp;quot;wife test&amp;quot; for me but it also only answers half my question, as I&amp;#39;d like to have a single web portal to access all of these disparate services. There&amp;#39;s solutions I&amp;#39;ve tried that are fairly close but just don&amp;#39;t meet all my criteria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically I don&amp;#39;t want to expose all the individual services to the internet via subdomains or proxying directly (radarr.domain.com or domain.com/radarr, etc). I also don&amp;#39;t want to access each service individually at all. I want a unified landing/splash page so that me/the wife can browse to &lt;a href=\"https://bookmark.domain.com\"&gt;https://bookmark.domain.com&lt;/a&gt;, authenticate, and from that single landing page we can access each individual resource. Authenticating into each local service after logging into this main service is probably inevitable, I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried pointing subdomains at services like Organizr or Home Assistant, where I can then have iframes or bookmarks to the rest of my services... But iframes fail because I&amp;#39;m reaching the service over https and the iframe content is only http, which isn&amp;#39;t allowed in modern browsers. hyperlinks fail because they are pointing to local resources while I&amp;#39;m not on the local network. I don&amp;#39;t want to simply assign sub-domains to the internal services to get those iframes working because passing lets encrypt validation to get an SSL cert means that I would still need to services exposed to the internet to pass validation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems like it must be a common problem so I expect there&amp;#39;s an easy answer. I&amp;#39;m hoping there&amp;#39;s a docker container that would allow what I&amp;#39;m looking for that I just haven&amp;#39;t found with my google/reddit searching yet..
