My background is in Physics, including PhD (which involved a lot of data analysis). I mainly work in R and SQL, but also did some work in Python during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m curious about Data Engineering, but I wonder whether I\u2019d actually be able to make a good one. I say that because I don\u2019t consider myself to be a \u201cpure\u201d programmer - like I could never see myself in a software development role for example. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the basics of DE, in terms of ETL (extracting data from the raw source, transforming it into a useable format, and loading it onto a SQL database, or AWS for example, so it\u2019s accessible to analysts and data scientists etc.), but I don\u2019t know much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just after some thoughts/advice on those who have perhaps made the change, did you enjoy or regret it, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "12spi5k", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JLane1996", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/12spi5k/can_a_good_data_analystscientist_make_a_good_data/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/12spi5k/can_a_good_data_analystscientist_make_a_good_data/", "subreddit_subscribers": 876940, "created_utc": 1681974346.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Just started a new position for a large company and tried to hit the ground running, ive tried to pull some basic KPI's on logistic performance.
