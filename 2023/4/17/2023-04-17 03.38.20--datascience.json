I recently had a negative experience with Capital One for a data science position. Details are below:\n\n* I was reached out by a recruiter from C1 about 2 weeks ago, asking for my availability for a 30 mins interview. I responded within that day my availability for that week and the week after.\n* Recruiter responded 5 days later, agreeing to schedule a call at 3PM the day after\n* The day after, recruiter sent me an email right before the call, saying that he needed to push back the call to the next day. I agreed and provided him with my availability for that day. Recruiter did not send any confirmation response.\n* The day after that, recruiter emailed me at 2:40PM, asking me if he could call at 3PM. I was in a meeting at the time, but still agreed to take the call and left the meeting early.\n* Recruiter never called at 3PM. He sent an email at 4:30PM stating that \u201csomething came up that was very time-sensitive,\u201d without any apology, and offered to reschedule for 6 PM that day or the next day. Again, I replied with an agreement to take the call at 6PM\n* Recruiter never called at 6PM.\n* The next day, I sent another email to recruiter, but this time, I copied Capital One's main careers/HR email address. He called me within a minute after I sent the email (lol).\n* The call lasted for 5 mins, for what was supposed to be a 30 mins call. He asked me basic questions like salary expectations, and relocation. I was not even asked \"Do you have any other questions about this role?\"\n* Recruiter said he would forward my resume to 2 hiring managers, and would let me know what they think. I asked for the hiring manager's names, and he said he would send me their linkedin profiles in a follow-up email.\n* Of course, I never received this follow-up email. I sent him an email asking for the hiring managers' contact info. He never replied.\n* Early morning the next day, I received a rejection email. Mind you, our call was around 5PM the previous day. This made me wonder whether my resume was ever forwarded to the hiring managers at all.\n\nTL,DR: Was flaked on 3 times by C1's recruiter. Finally got a super brief call because I copied the main HR email address in the chain. Got rejected the next day.\n\nWhat do you think I should have done differently in this process?

But the programs are pretty different from each other. I don't know what factors to prioritize. One of my primary objectives is bagging a very **high-paying role** immediately after grad, and continued rapid growth in the next 3 years. I'm an international, and H1B visa is dicey nowadays - I must speedily recover the **\\~$110k** I'd be spending at any of the two institutions.\n\n**Bonus comparison** : I also have a **DS** Admit from **University of Rochester**, which will cost me half (with 25% scholarship). Its reviews are all fine, nothing extra-ordinarily good or bad. Could get DS jobs from there too. But isn't in the same league. \n\n**Brief background** : I have 3 years of experience in Applied Deep Learning research (title being Data Scientist though) and a couple of papers in Vision and RL. I'm extremely fascinated about AGI and concerned for the Safety and Alignment of advanced Intelligence. I have **No** experience in production/deployment or traditional Data Science/analytics/stats. I also hold an MS in Physics and BE in Mechanical Engineering from a premier institute in my country, but with a pretty bad GPA (7/10).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**MS Data Science at Columbia**](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/)**:**\n\n**Pros**:\n\n* Ivy League, enjoys prestige across the world, including my country, if I return.\n* In Manhattan, so a lot of companies come for career fairs. Wouldn't have to move much.\n* Alumni in general seem to be well placed in Industry, not necessarily in proper ML roles though.\n* Has a nice Effective Altruism student chapter, focuses on AI Safety etc.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* **Extremely** [**Shitty core curriculum**](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/#curriculum) \\- just 3 basic applied stats and 3 basic CS courses thrown together. No real data science or machine learning.\n* Unimpressive choice of electives- More parallel to an analytics degree.\n* Only 3 electives allowed. Applied ML and DL are electives and not core, so will occupy 2 spaces.\n* Needlessly terse and theoretically rigorous. People do have trouble keeping up.\n* Living in the hustle-bustle of costly NYC can be a pain.\n* **200-250+ batch** size, can lead to higher competition.\n* People here all have 9.2+ /10 GPA in undergrad. I got admitted somehow at 7, probably historic. May not fare well or fit with the kind of perseverant students here.  Also heard most here are pretty snobby and elitist.\n* Grade deflation, so may lag behind in class, I'm not hard-working at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**MS Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/overview/)**:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Also enjoys a very high repute, and a Top 10 US News National Universities rank (Does it matter?)\n* [**Excellent core curriculum**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/msai-traditional.html). Proper ML, DL, AI, NLP, HCI courses with great syllabi covering breadth of AI.\n* [**GOD-TIER electives**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/courses.html), long list from Modern DL, core CS, advanced Robotics, PM, what not. One I was boggled by was \"[Artificial Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jURIbvpQ0imcaMk-AHUmj_szZNtsA4lZAlcqXa6usXs/edit)\". Many other dreamy, futuristic courses (but not hand-wavy). Some courses also cover [Superintelligence](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/descriptions/comp-sci-496-23.html) and other AI Safety stuff.\n* Most courses like Deep Generative Models, RL, Artificial Vision etc are updated with the current **state-of-the-art**. The NLP core course also has 30 papers to read from 1950s to GPT-3. Has many other seminar-based PhD level courses too.\n* Does not focus too much on maths/stats apart from a few Data Science related courses, just enough theoretical and formal depth in most courses.\n* Most courses have a significant project component (usually free to choose), and regular assignments involving the latest frameworks and architectures . PyTorch is used throughout the curriculum.\n* Lots of industry seminars, projects etc. Generally good industrial connections. Companies come and give projects, can also sometimes convert to full-time/internships.\n* Can also take Entrepreneurship and other great courses from the amazing Kellogg school.\n* Only **40 people cohort**. Uni is more responsive to needs of the batch and each individual.\n* Grade Inflation, so no worries about performing better relative to others.\n* Meticulously selected 40 students with generally 3+ years of experience in AI : so elevated rigour of projects and more to learn from others, stronger personal connections (though I'm an introvert).\n* Evanston is a more placid and calm place to get lost in studies for 1.3 years.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* The AI program is newer and not as well-known, or considered a feeder into the industry yet. I don't know if the repute of Northwestern in the industry matches Columbia or falls short enough to make a difference (or exceeds??). The alumni seem not as well-placed but difficult to judge ratios etc. from linkedin.\n* The research prowess of the dept isn't as great (evident by cs-rankings). The proffs at NU aren't well-established as AI researchers. The teaching is also sometimes underwhelming from what I heard from current students. But I'm a self-learner anyway, will do with Stanford/UCB lectures.\n* Could be a really heavy courseload as well, since it's a quarter system with about 4-5 courses each quarter. Would want to take even more since there's no extra cost to add the lovely electives.\n* Evanston/even Chicago isn't really a great place to be for Tech ? I'd have to relocate to NYC/SF later.

Also, does NYC play any real role (Isn't networking virtual anyways?)\n\nImho there's nothing good with Columbia DS apart from recognition, and NU's AI curriculum is one of the greatest in the world.

Removed and added NU and Columbia from my final shortlist multiple times, coz never thought I'd get in. NU already seemed full, they had specifically instructed to not apply after Dec 15, if you want to be considered fully, lol.
