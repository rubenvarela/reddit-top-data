I won&amp;#39;t discount disc rot since they&amp;#39;re pretty old, but even if disc rot has set in for the majority, by virtue of sheer numbers there is likely some unicorns that survived this long unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But any option of why my computer can&amp;#39;t read them is beyond what I can manage with my hardware or budget, which is why I&amp;#39;m posting here. Does anyone know of a product or service that might be able to help with reading/ripping the discs that won&amp;#39;t cost an arm and a leg?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, alternately, does anyone here already have a setup that might be able to read/rip them? I&amp;#39;d be happy to ship a handful of discs to test, or if you&amp;#39;re in the Portland, OR area I&amp;#39;d have no problem meeting to hand over the entire box. Shipping the entire box right off the rip would be prohibitively expensive, though, because there is A Lot and they are Very Heavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I forgot to add, I&amp;#39;m on Windows 10!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17yl3sf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "panpanpandy", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17yl3sf/burned_dvds_showing_as_blank_2000s_news/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17yl3sf/burned_dvds_showing_as_blank_2000s_news/", "subreddit_subscribers": 712876, "created_utc": 1700355644.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "So I've had a few iphones over the years, sometimes done backups using itunes back in the day, but always manually just pulled photos off the phones and into backup drives.

Some obvious concerns:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone taking the SSD: None of the photos are sensitive, so if someone got access to the mini pc I would just remove it from the list of devices on tailscale. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone accessing my network via the mini pc: I know there is a chance that someone uses the sff pc to access my network, but personally I think that is an acceptable risk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Single data drive in the sff pc: I&amp;#39;m trying to this easy for my parents, just plug it in next to their router and be done with it. I don&amp;#39;t want to step up to a small tower with space for multiple drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How secure is tailscale? I know that &amp;quot;anything open to the internet is accessible&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;m just looking for a reasonable level of security. If some bad actor really wants onto my network in particular I&amp;#39;d assume they&amp;#39;re going to get in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7eead6f2-b94e-11eb-af94-0e4c7cd4fb01", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17y8omd", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "benk950", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17y8omd/small_offsite_backup/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17y8omd/small_offsite_backup/", "subreddit_subscribers": 712876, "created_utc": 1700320852.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "My apologies ahead of time if this post isn't flared correctly.

To potentially help someone who wants to do something similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some background info:**\n\nMy main source of data comes from Video/Photography, I keep a copy of all my work in multiple different places at different stages in the editing process.  However, my current solution which is a mix of cloud storage and USB HDDs/SSDs is reaching its limit, and rather than pay astronomical amounts of money for cloud storage or run out of USB ports I decided to design a storage system that would outlast my foreseeable storage needs and be expandable if I ever needed more. In addition to the Photo/Video data, I am also creating backups of old family movies, DVDs, CDs, Etc. (So I guess I got bit by the Data Hoarder bug LOL)\n\n**The Plan:**\n\nAfter switching between a NAS and a DAS in my head, I decided to go for the latter so I am less limited by bandwidth. (As my NIC is 2.5G and a regular USB 3.0 port is good for 5G) My current laptop is an Intel-based machine with one Thunderbolt 4 port. This would give me the most bandwidth to work with as speed is a relatively important factor as I can sometimes be ingesting 10-50+GB of data at any given time. I know that there are Thunderbolt/USB-C-based solutions that allow for multiple drives and expansion, but since they are pretty niche they also come with a hefty price tag.  This left me with little options. By the title, you can probably tell what I did, but I had never seen a NetApp Disk Shelf hooked up to Thunderbolt much less hooked up to a dynamic device like a laptop. I wasn't entirely sure it would work either, in theory, there was nothing I could think of that would prevent me from hooking such a device to my laptop. Also with the future prospect of of Thunderbolt 5 offering even more bandwidth to the end user, there is also a potential to \"upgrade\" down the line. So I quite literally said \"screw it\", and purchased the following items:\n\n\\- NetApp DS2246\n\n\\- Asus X IN WIN eGPU enclosure\n\n\\- LSI 2308 Mustang RAID Card\n\nOnce all of the items arrived I assembled them and hooked each one up one at a time. The eGPU enclosure popped right up in Windows, good. Next put in the LSI Card, being that it was a half-height card in a full-height slot, I had to bend a remove a piece of the PCI-e bracket in order for it to fit somewhat flush in the enclosure. I plugged it in and heard Windows chime, due to a device insertion, but I could not for the life of me find where this LSI Card was, and if Windows was even seeing it. After about two hours' worth of troubleshooting with a friend, I was able to see where the card was located in Device Manager. It was located under \"Storage Controllers\". It was also at this point I realized that on the one physical card, there were two controllers. The next thing I did was hook the disk shelf up to the LSI Card. Sometime after the original purchases, I bought two 3.84TB Samsung PM1633 SAS SSDs. I didn't even know those existed. I didn't want to go all flash but I accepted the risks and studied the ways of SSD failure. Now because of storage density alone, I feel confident in my choice.\n\nI installed MegaRaid Storage Manager and through that, I was able to see that it detected the NetApp but saw no drives within it. Someone else on Reddit said that the LSI Card should already be in IT Mode, However, that was not the case. the next challenge was getting the right firmware for my card and finding a way to flash it. This turned out to be difficult because finding the correct firmware was hard enough, finding a way to flash it was exponentially harder, given all of the variations of RAID cards out there. I will have to update this post to detail the exact steps I took, but it involved creating a custom EFI Shell from scratch on a USB Drive, creating specific directories with specific names, and copying corresponding files to them. From there I had to boot into my BIOS, disable Secure Boot (or at least set it to Audit mode), create a custom boot option pointing to the USB drive, and then boot from the newly created option. Then I was presented with a command line interface and was now in a separate BIOS specifically for the RAID Card. I had just used my own BIOS as a jumping-off point to get into another one. While I never imagined such a thing would be possible, I realized this was no different than booting a Windows installer from a USB, it's just a REALLY long-winded and complicated way to go about it. Once I was in this secondary BIOS I ran a series of commands (Which I will have to update later) and successfully flashed one of my controllers into IT mode. I hope to be able to make a video tutorial on how I did it so that maybe someone else won't have to struggle as much as I did. \ud83d\ude02 Once I re-enabled Secure Boot and got back into Windows, the two SAS drives showed up in Disk Management. I then put the two drives in a simple Storage Space and ran some tests. I was able to Read and Write at about 400 **Megabytes** per second, very solid numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Issues I have found thus far:**\n\nRunning Mega Raid Storage Manager will make the LSI Card crap itself and just stop functioning for some reason. I have uninstalled it since then\n\nThe Read and Write speeds are not where they should be. Each PM1633 should be good until about 1000 Megabytes per second. I purchased a second cable to see if it was a link speed issue and I saw no improvement. I tried different pooling software and had the same result. Interestingly, each drive on its own, will pull about the same numbers. This leads me to believe it is further up the chain of devices, however, because there are so many I am not exactly sure where to troubleshoot.\n\nThe DS2246 is LOUD. I am measuring about 67Db on startup from one meter away and 72Db. However, I am in the process of performing a fan mod. I am replacing the current 30W fans with 18W ones. I can go into more detail about this if anyone is curious.\n\nWindows will sometimes not eject the LSI Card saying that it is in use. Windows Storage Spaces seems to do OK with random disconnects. (I need to take my laptop somewhere) However, since it has been a short amount of time I can't be certain that I won't experience any data loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In Closing:**\n\nThis has been a very challenging but enlightening project. I hope that I went into enough detail that if someone is interested in doing this for themselves this post is able to help them. If you have any questions for me I would be happy to answer them. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve this, or fix any of the issues I listed above please let me know. If there is an issue (or a potential one) that you see that I am not seeing don't hesitate to comment either! I get the sense this community is full of genuine people who want to help one another and I hope I can repay that even a little bit.

They deliver street-power to the attached devices through some basic surge-protection until they detect a loss of street-power, then they switch to battery very quickly.\n\n&gt; That is not what the term line interactive means, though there generally is some surge protection in the UPS as well.\n\n&gt; Line interactive means that the UPS when running from street power semi-regulates the output voltage to keep it in a more consistent range. It does this by using the transformer in the UPS to \"boost\" or \"buck\" the output voltage. Even very cheap UPSs of this type have a minimum of one buck and one boost, and some have more.\n\n&gt; Prior to line interactive, non-online UPSs were called standby UPSs, and line interactive is a standby UPS with a bit of clever tap-changing to increase the value and thus the sell price of inverters.\n\n&gt; Opinion: line interactive offers no advantages over old-school standby UPSs, as modern kit has switch mode power supplies which are very tolerant of rubbish power, so semi-regulating the power prior to the load is a waste of time. But..... the market has decided, and now standby UPSs have vanished, and line interactive is everywhere.\n\n&gt; In terms of on-line UPSs:\n\n   &gt;&gt;  Street-power flows into the unit, and is pushed through a transformer to feed the batteries. Power is pulled from the batteries through another transformer to power the attached load.\n\n&gt; That statement implies something that doesn't happen.\n\n&gt; The hallmark of a double-conversion or online UPS is that the load is (almost) always supplied from the inverter, and thus there is no switchover seen by the load between street and battery power.\n\n&gt; But, the DC power does not flow \"through\" the batteries; the batteries are kept charged as per any UPS, and the inverter gets is DC from the input converter. When street fails then the batteries now have to supply all the current, they get the same surprise that batteries in every UPS gets.\n\n\nHow true is this?", "author_fullname": "t2_12cb1v", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Do I really need a sine wave line interactive UPS?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17yovmw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1700368187.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1700367829.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see that a lot of Eaton models (both ECO and Pro lines) are not actually pure sine wave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recommended ECO models that I&amp;#39;ve seen, is basically offline/standby not line interactive.

Even very cheap UPSs of this type have a minimum of one buck and one boost, and some have more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to line interactive, non-online UPSs were called standby UPSs, and line interactive is a standby UPS with a bit of clever tap-changing to increase the value and thus the sell price of inverters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opinion: line interactive offers no advantages over old-school standby UPSs, as modern kit has switch mode power supplies which are very tolerant of rubbish power, so semi-regulating the power prior to the load is a waste of time. But..... the market has decided, and now standby UPSs have vanished, and line interactive is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of on-line UPSs:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Street-power flows into the unit, and is pushed through a transformer to feed the batteries. Power is pulled from the batteries through another transformer to power the attached load.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That statement implies something that doesn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of a double-conversion or online UPS is that the load is (almost) always supplied from the inverter, and thus there is no switchover seen by the load between street and battery power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, the DC power does not flow &amp;quot;through&amp;quot; the batteries; the batteries are kept charged as per any UPS, and the inverter gets is DC from the input converter. When street fails then the batteries now have to supply all the current, they get the same surprise that batteries in every UPS gets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How true is this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "20c598d2-b3f5-11ea-8f7a-0e7cd54fad9b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "17yovmw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "appwizcpl", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17yovmw/do_i_really_need_a_sine_wave_line_interactive_ups/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17yovmw/do_i_really_need_a_sine_wave_line_interactive_ups/", "subreddit_subscribers": 712876, "created_utc": 1700367829.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I've downloaded a bunch of podcasts and want to put the podcast name as the \"Contributing artist\" in the details so I can filter better.

Anyone have any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17ymn8h", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KallistiTMP", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17ymn8h/ripping_a_ton_of_microsd_cards/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17ymn8h/ripping_a_ton_of_microsd_cards/", "subreddit_subscribers": 712876, "created_utc": 1700360370.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
