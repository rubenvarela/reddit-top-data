To say it was difficult would be an understatement, and it\u2019s not just the program itself that made it so, but two external factors which (I\u2019ll list below) made studying a challenge. \n\n\n\n1. WORK: If you have a hard job already, DON\u2019T combine it with a data science masters. You could literally breakdown completely due to stress. My school recommend working only 10 hours per week and I ignored the advice because I needed the money. I worked 20 hours per week doing menial jobs. At some point I thought I would actually drop dead due to stress. Keep in mind that 20 hours is still part time work. I strongly recommend working a maximum  10 hours per week or not working at all if you\u2019re prone to stress.   My classmates who worked full time during their masters had very poor grades (some even dropped out). \n\n\n\n2. Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh\u2026. Yeah that went out the window completely when things got heated during the program. Not seeing family in the flesh  affected my mental health. I noticed that people who took the program with their families  were a lot happier than those of us who didn\u2019t have any family around. Speaking to family, friends and classmates going through the same program really helped A LOT though. You really can\u2019t go through this program as a loner. Life would hit you on the face like a brick for every single day of your existence if you attempt to do so. \n\nThat\u2019s my 2 cents. AA\n\nEDIT: \nCourse Selection: Just remembered this but uhh course selection is REALLY IMPORTANT. I had done enough online courses on data science before my masters, to know that neural networks and deep learning is something you study ON YOUR OWN, and  NOT as part of an official course. If you\u2019re new to data science, pick the easiest courses for your masters. I saw enough people completely fail their courses (and subsequently the entire masters) because they wanted courses that sound trendy. Seriously that\u2019s the only reason they chose them.

To say it was difficult would be an understatement, and it\u2019s not just the program itself that made it so, but two external factors which (I\u2019ll list below) made studying a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WORK: If you have a hard job already, DON\u2019T combine it with a data science masters. You could literally breakdown completely due to stress. My school recommend working only 10 hours per week and I ignored the advice because I needed the money. I worked 20 hours per week doing menial jobs. At some point I thought I would actually drop dead due to stress. Keep in mind that 20 hours is still part time work. I strongly recommend working a maximum  10 hours per week or not working at all if you\u2019re prone to stress.   My classmates who worked full time during their masters had very poor grades (some even dropped out). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh\u2026. Yeah that went out the window completely when things got heated during the program. Not seeing family in the flesh  affected my mental health. I noticed that people who took the program with their families  were a lot happier than those of us who didn\u2019t have any family around. Speaking to family, friends and classmates going through the same program really helped A LOT though. You really can\u2019t go through this program as a loner. Life would hit you on the face like a brick for every single day of your existence if you attempt to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s my 2 cents. AA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: \nCourse Selection: Just remembered this but uhh course selection is REALLY IMPORTANT. I had done enough online courses on data science before my masters, to know that neural networks and deep learning is something you study ON YOUR OWN, and  NOT as part of an official course. If you\u2019re new to data science, pick the easiest courses for your masters.

The accuracy will be confirmed using our selected image dataset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Detection Elements: Conduct analysis of ethnicity, recognize body features (like Rack), and other specific attributes that will be revealed at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#1a1a1b", "id": "17zuqmk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ninja_killed_baba", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17zuqmk/task_at_hand_any_suggestions_for_how_to_approach/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17zuqmk/task_at_hand_any_suggestions_for_how_to_approach/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1140826, "created_utc": 1700503648.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_89ar1fajx", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Have you noticed any impacts from the demographic cliff starting to impact your team or organization", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1803dio", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1700525281.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#1a1a1b", "id": "1803dio", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AnxiousEgg6284", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1803dio/have_you_noticed_any_impacts_from_the_demographic/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1803dio/have_you_noticed_any_impacts_from_the_demographic/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1140826, "created_utc": 1700525281.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
