I made this app with the intent to track hardware, computers, servers, cars, lawnmowers, you name it. I know this program has a LONG way to go. I've spent a little more than a month trying to learn and program all of this. This is my first program that's has to do with self-hosting. Any help, support, pointers are greatly appreciated. Sorry for all the comments as i play around with various forms/ai/examples I have to spell out a lot of what the program does. I was told that it would be like the aCar app (though I have never used it).

This is all new to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vy473hmkjqzb1.png?width=1911&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba18c8e637c04f27ccb479f5b3bea47a073abb2c\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vy473hmkjqzb1.png?width=1911&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba18c8e637c04f27ccb479f5b3bea47a073abb2c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full video: &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yVl50MPe3gW6vDKP-tBM84zNR_iCxdVU/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yVl50MPe3gW6vDKP-tBM84zNR_iCxdVU/view?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quick GIF of video:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/cevezsbh1xzb1.gif\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/cevezsbh1xzb1.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/o2dxq5fi1xzb1.gif\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/o2dxq5fi1xzb1.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calendar Subscription:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/qpvx82n93xzb1.gif\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/qpvx82n93xzb1.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Main page: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/RyGuy994/MATER\"&gt;RyGuy994/MATER: Self-hosted asset information backup (github.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First release:  &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/RyGuy994/MATER/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha\"&gt;Release MATER v0.0.1-alpha Release \u00b7 RyGuy994/MATER (github.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s New&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Release:&lt;/strong&gt; MATER v0.0.1 is the first stable release, offering a robust foundation for asset tracking and maintenance. image&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Features:&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Asset Management: Track and organize your assets with ease.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Service Records: Log and manage service activities for each asset.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;User-friendly Interface: Intuitive design for a seamless user experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Roadmap:&lt;/strong&gt; This release sets the stage for exciting developments in the future, including a mobile app(android + iOS), modular database architecture, with the option to use a breakaway database, calendar integration, API for Intergrations with things like HA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After set up Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to explore MATER.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How to Contribute&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is valuable!

I made this app with the intent to track hardware, computers, servers, cars, lawnmowers, you name it. I know this program has a LONG way to go. I&amp;#39;ve spent a little more than a month trying to learn and program all of this. This is my first program that&amp;#39;s has to do with self-hosting. Any help, support, pointers are greatly appreciated. Sorry for all the comments as i play around with various forms/ai/examples I have to spell out a lot of what the program does. I was told that it would be like the aCar app (though I have never used it). Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7a2c90d0-4655-11ec-b067-9e334eed55f0", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17swm5o", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheRyGuy994", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 16, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/17swm5o/mater_v001_release_maintenance_asset_tracking/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/17swm5o/mater_v001_release_maintenance_asset_tracking/", "subreddit_subscribers": 290345, "created_utc": 1699716143.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra343yd71xzb1.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c28993a7b5a6ebe2d09b0d08896190e8e3349e0f\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/louislam/dockge](https://github.com/louislam/dockge)\n\nThis is my second self-hosted project.

but things are getting expensive and  since I got some new workstations from a friend that they were decommissioning (they are moving to a new place and have a bigger budget for a data center) I got 2 Lenovo Workstation each with Ryzen 9 5900X 32GB RAM and 1TB NVMe\n\nI want to set up HA for this service and maybe add some other computer as a NAS, so my question is how should  I go about doing this I was thinking proxmox on both nodes and setup HA, but I think that needs a common Data store (probably will be using the NAS for this) and how should I go about setting up the HTTP server (I have some stuff that also runs in docker containers I was thinking having one HTTP server for managing all that traffic with DNS and stuff)  and monitoring any help is much appreciated\n\nEdit: my service

I have it setup in a couple of EC2 instances, but things are getting expensive and  since I got some new workstations from a friend that they were decommissioning (they are moving to a new place and have a bigger budget for a data center) I got 2 Lenovo Workstation each with Ryzen 9 5900X 32GB RAM and 1TB NVMe&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to set up HA for this service and maybe add some other computer as a NAS, so my question is how should  I go about doing this I was thinking proxmox on both nodes and setup HA, but I think that needs a common Data store (probably will be using the NAS for this) and how should I go about setting up the HTTP server (I have some stuff that also runs in docker containers I was thinking having one HTTP server for managing all that traffic with DNS and stuff)  and monitoring any help is much appreciated&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: my service is a web service (React, Spring boot, PostgreSQL)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes":

I'm film editor, so i need high performance connection. My only limitation is budget and server is going to have multiple functions. Fon now i have it built, but only for tests. It's based on truenas scale.   \nHardware: i7-8700k, 32GB ram (not ECC :c ), 2x 4tb ironwolf drives (raid 1 conf), 1 256GB Nvme and 1 250GB SSD. Also little 1060ti gpu.\n\nPlans for upgrade: 10000 Mbps Intel X540-T2, 5 x Toshiba MG06A 8TB (Raid 5), TRENDnet Ethernet USB-C 5Gb/s (my plan is direct connection to Macbook)\n\nI want it to be multiple services at once, so i'm using contaniers in truenas for apps, SATA SSD is for system, NVME is for apps, and raid is for data (I know for now raid 1 is baaad idea, i don't have another  disk for parity data)\n\nService 1: Editing NAS storage  \nService 2: Jellyfin media server for vids (My own collection as well as projects in progress for clients)  \nService 3: Torrent server  \nService 4: Uploading service / Cloud service (Nextcloud / Projectsend) to get projects directly from remote clients to my editing space.  \nService 5: Windows VM (For apps i can't run at mac)  \nService 6: Website.  \nService 7: MAYBE: Rendering server for resolve.\n\nMy internet connection is 1000/100, i have public IP. My problem is, i don't want directly expose my server to the public. I've tried cloudflare tunnels, but it has transfer limitations.

Back then, game server managers weren't as complete as they are now; most of them were command line-based in DOS for e-sports game tournaments or QuakeCON-style events, even from [**The CPL**](https://letmegpt.com/?q=cyberathlete%20professional%20league) days. Professionally, I work in Client Platform Engineering, and automating tasks is pretty much my day-to-day work life. I love it. This also means I script a lot, so I'm very familiar with all scripting languages, full-stack development, etc.\n\nAs of 5 years ago, I have been dabbling with more modern GSM (Game Server Management) platforms in an effort to run a server with my Guildmates and other friends who enjoy this craft. In this time, I have used several different GSMs for various purposes. Some of them are decent enough to run from a business standpoint, but none of them are something I would call a \"turnkey\" solution. I hope the community in [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) can provide more insight into other similar systems or platforms I may have missed. The main feature I am looking for in a modern GSM is that it uses Docker to store the game servers.\n\nFrom oldest to newest, here are the GSMs I have used:\n\n1. **WindowsGSM**: WindowsGSM was the first GSM I started dabbling with about 5 years ago. It runs on Windows (you can use it on Windows or Windows Server). The more memory you add to your server, the more WindowsGSM struggles. But if you just want to run a couple of servers to play with your friends, look no further; WindowsGSM will do the job. The community is pretty friendly and laid-back, offering a lot of help, even to the most clueless people in the Discord. The \"template\" for adding servers to WindowsGSM is based on C#, and depending on your scripting skills, it can be challenging. Nevertheless, the community has a few aces who come up with templates quickly as new games are released. There have been talks from the main developer about a 3.0 version that will be web-based, but it hasn't materialized yet.\n   - **Website**: [WindowsGSM](https://windowsgsm.com)\n   - **Plugins**: [WindowsGSM Plugins](https://windowsgsm.com/products/windowsgsm-plugins)\n   - **Discord**: [WindowsGSM Discord](https://windowsgsm.com/discord)\n\n2. **AMP** by _Cube Coders_: AMP was the second GSM I used after WindowsGSM. I had tried Pterodactyl, but the community literally punched me in the face, so I was lured to AMP by someone I had met in the Pterodactyl Discord. AMP is closed-source but, like Pterodactyl, it uses Docker to store and launch game server content. I have to say the interface is polished and looks different from all other GSMs, but if you want to build a store around it and use it for e-commerce game servers for rent, it's not going to work out. You will need to build that yourself and somehow integrate it into AMP. The \"template\" system for adding game servers is an absolute nightmare. They use something called **KVP** (Key Value Pair), which is a type of .ini file format. You declare a bunch of variables in it, some lines in minified JSON, bash, etc. I script for a living, and I find it challenging. Talk about an unfriendly format for server deployments. When you turn to the community for help, it depends on who you talk to; you can find a friendly person who is still enthusiastic or someone who somehow hates life and therefore finds your question beneath them, so they answer in the most unhelpful cryptic way possible. But among most of these GSMs, it's the one that is the most stable. If they threw away the KVP system they use for templating and built something friendlier (like Pterodactyl's egg editor), I would let bygones be bygones and build a platform around it, but as it stands, it's a HARD PASS. It's pretty cheap; I think I paid $25 or $50 for a network license that lets me host around 50 servers or so. Good for enthusiast level, but not for running a commercial platform.\n\n3. **Pterodactyl**: Pterodactyl is where I went next, and it's where I have spent most of my time. I had to grab the bull by the horns and use all my predisposition to get it working, and at some point, I did, and it was great. Then I changed my architecture to something more robust, and getting it up and running has been quite the challenge. But if you get over the outdated documentation and unoptimized installation sequence and can connect Wings to the Panel server, it's fire and forget and pretty robust after that. I have to say, from all the platforms I had tested at this point, Pterodactyl has promise, and that promise relies on someone else taking the mantle and carrying it further, to where the puck should be, not where it's at right now. Pterodactyl's server template system is referred to as an Egg, and it's pretty much a JSON file that contains everything Pterodactyl needs to deploy a game server into a Docker container. At first, it's intimidating, but once you get used to JSON, it's pretty easy to build an Egg, probably the least complicated of all the GSMs when it comes to that. Pterodactyl has a beautiful interface with a built-in editor that allows you to EASILY build an Egg for your favorite game. The other great aspect Pterodactyl has is the **Support Bot** in their Discord. The devs built an entire infrastructure to allow you to paste your logs via [Ptero.co](https://ptero.co), and if you paste that pastebin (it's in hastebin), then **Support Bot** spits out a pretty precise answer as to what your problem might be. If it's a problem that is a textbook example, then you will be in luck as **Support Bot** will take care of you. But if this problem lies in different features or integrations like _cough_ **cloudflare** _cough_ or _cough_ **cors errors** _cough_, then you will have to deal with the _human_ element, which is not too kind and will most likely turn into a toxic conversation depending on how thick your skin really is. Some people know how to properly provide feedback and logs and other proofs to ask a question, and if you do it like that, then it's most likely someone there will answer you in that same high-level line of thought. On the other hand, if you are a newbie and you beg for help: \"Help me, someone\" and don't provide logs, well yeah, it gets rough. The other Achilles' heel of Pterodactyl is the documentation. It's rough. Like... really bad, in terms of coverage. It could be so much more and properly answer some of the biggest questions when it comes to common issues. It really needs work.\n   - **Website**: [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io)\n   - **Official Egg repo**: [Pterodactyl Eggs](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs)\n   - **Discord**: [Pterodactyl Discord](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl)\n\n4. I found **Jexactyl** by pure accident. It's a Pterodactyl \"Panel\" replacement, much more modernized and probably the best iteration of Pterodactyl if you want to run a commercial server that has Payment Modules, Ticketing System, Front-End functionality, an enhanced interface; in short, Jexactyl is where you think Pterodactyl would be if it were vastly improved. It's not perfect; the documentation has some \"issues,\" but it's nowhere as bad as its grandpa. The community is helpful, non-toxic, unlike the \"elder,\" and I only wish Jex would participate more. It sometimes feels like Jexactyl is a pet project that doesn't require his attention as much. But the community does really pick up where his ball drops. Once you are done with the installation of the \"panel,\" then you can follow the Wings installation instructions from Pterodactyl. But if, for some reason, the community in Jexactyl can't answer your question, you are better off asking ChatGPT for help because the second the Pterodactyl community gets a whiff that you are running Jexactyl, they won't help you, and the door will be shut. I like Jexactyl a lot, but once it ends its upgrading of the Panel interface, it doesn't do much more, and you are left carrying the rest of the sins of the father.

Back then, game server managers weren&amp;#39;t as complete as they are now; most of them were command line-based in DOS for e-sports game tournaments or QuakeCON-style events, even from &lt;a href=\"https://letmegpt.com/?q=cyberathlete%20professional%20league\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CPL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; days. Professionally, I work in Client Platform Engineering, and automating tasks is pretty much my day-to-day work life. I love it. This also means I script a lot, so I&amp;#39;m very familiar with all scripting languages, full-stack development, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of 5 years ago, I have been dabbling with more modern GSM (Game Server Management) platforms in an effort to run a server with my Guildmates and other friends who enjoy this craft. In this time, I have used several different GSMs for various purposes. Some of them are decent enough to run from a business standpoint, but none of them are something I would call a &amp;quot;turnkey&amp;quot; solution. I hope the community in &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/\"&gt;r/selfhosted&lt;/a&gt; can provide more insight into other similar systems or platforms I may have missed. The main feature I am looking for in a modern GSM is that it uses Docker to store the game servers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From oldest to newest, here are the GSMs I have used:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WindowsGSM&lt;/strong&gt;: WindowsGSM was the first GSM I started dabbling with about 5 years ago. It runs on Windows (you can use it on Windows or Windows Server). The more memory you add to your server, the more WindowsGSM struggles. But if you just want to run a couple of servers to play with your friends, look no further; WindowsGSM will do the job. The community is pretty friendly and laid-back, offering a lot of help, even to the most clueless people in the Discord. The &amp;quot;template&amp;quot; for adding servers to WindowsGSM is based on C#, and depending on your scripting skills, it can be challenging. Nevertheless, the community has a few aces who come up with templates quickly as new games are released. There have been talks from the main developer about a 3.0 version that will be web-based, but it hasn&amp;#39;t materialized yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://windowsgsm.com\"&gt;WindowsGSM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugins&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://windowsgsm.com/products/windowsgsm-plugins\"&gt;WindowsGSM Plugins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://windowsgsm.com/discord\"&gt;WindowsGSM Discord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMP&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Cube Coders&lt;/em&gt;: AMP was the second GSM I used after WindowsGSM. I had tried Pterodactyl, but the community literally punched me in the face, so I was lured to AMP by someone I had met in the Pterodactyl Discord. AMP is closed-source but, like Pterodactyl, it uses Docker to store and launch game server content. I have to say the interface is polished and looks different from all other GSMs, but if you want to build a store around it and use it for e-commerce game servers for rent, it&amp;#39;s not going to work out. You will need to build that yourself and somehow integrate it into AMP. The &amp;quot;template&amp;quot; system for adding game servers is an absolute nightmare. They use something called &lt;strong&gt;KVP&lt;/strong&gt; (Key Value Pair), which is a type of .ini file format. You declare a bunch of variables in it, some lines in minified JSON, bash, etc. I script for a living, and I find it challenging. Talk about an unfriendly format for server deployments. When you turn to the community for help, it depends on who you talk to; you can find a friendly person who is still enthusiastic or someone who somehow hates life and therefore finds your question beneath them, so they answer in the most unhelpful cryptic way possible. But among most of these GSMs, it&amp;#39;s the one that is the most stable. If they threw away the KVP system they use for templating and built something friendlier (like Pterodactyl&amp;#39;s egg editor), I would let bygones be bygones and build a platform around it, but as it stands, it&amp;#39;s a HARD PASS. It&amp;#39;s pretty cheap; I think I paid $25 or $50 for a network license that lets me host around 50 servers or so. Good for enthusiast level, but not for running a commercial platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pterodactyl&lt;/strong&gt;: Pterodactyl is where I went next, and it&amp;#39;s where I have spent most of my time. I had to grab the bull by the horns and use all my predisposition to get it working, and at some point, I did, and it was great. Then I changed my architecture to something more robust, and getting it up and running has been quite the challenge. But if you get over the outdated documentation and unoptimized installation sequence and can connect Wings to the Panel server, it&amp;#39;s fire and forget and pretty robust after that. I have to say, from all the platforms I had tested at this point, Pterodactyl has promise, and that promise relies on someone else taking the mantle and carrying it further, to where the puck should be, not where it&amp;#39;s at right now. Pterodactyl&amp;#39;s server template system is referred to as an Egg, and it&amp;#39;s pretty much a JSON file that contains everything Pterodactyl needs to deploy a game server into a Docker container. At first, it&amp;#39;s intimidating, but once you get used to JSON, it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to build an Egg, probably the least complicated of all the GSMs when it comes to that. Pterodactyl has a beautiful interface with a built-in editor that allows you to EASILY build an Egg for your favorite game. The other great aspect Pterodactyl has is the &lt;strong&gt;Support Bot&lt;/strong&gt; in their Discord. The devs built an entire infrastructure to allow you to paste your logs via &lt;a href=\"https://ptero.co\"&gt;Ptero.co&lt;/a&gt;, and if you paste that pastebin (it&amp;#39;s in hastebin), then &lt;strong&gt;Support Bot&lt;/strong&gt; spits out a pretty precise answer as to what your problem might be. If it&amp;#39;s a problem that is a textbook example, then you will be in luck as &lt;strong&gt;Support Bot&lt;/strong&gt; will take care of you. But if this problem lies in different features or integrations like &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cloudflare&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cors errors&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;, then you will have to deal with the &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; element, which is not too kind and will most likely turn into a toxic conversation depending on how thick your skin really is. Some people know how to properly provide feedback and logs and other proofs to ask a question, and if you do it like that, then it&amp;#39;s most likely someone there will answer you in that same high-level line of thought. On the other hand, if you are a newbie and you beg for help: &amp;quot;Help me, someone&amp;quot; and don&amp;#39;t provide logs, well yeah, it gets rough. The other Achilles&amp;#39; heel of Pterodactyl is the documentation. It&amp;#39;s rough. Like... really bad, in terms of coverage. It could be so much more and properly answer some of the biggest questions when it comes to common issues. It really needs work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://pterodactyl.io\"&gt;Pterodactyl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official Egg repo&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs\"&gt;Pterodactyl Eggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/pterodactyl\"&gt;Pterodactyl Discord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;strong&gt;Jexactyl&lt;/strong&gt; by pure accident.
