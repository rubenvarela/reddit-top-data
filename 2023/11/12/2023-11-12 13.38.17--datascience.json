One of the GPTs provided with this update by OpenAI is a Data Analysis assistant, showing the company already identified this area as a strong application for its tech.\n\nJust by providing a dataset you can start generating some simple or more advanced visualisations, including those needing some data processing or aggregations. This means anyone can interact with a dataset just using plain English.\n\nIf you're curious (and have a ChatGPT+ subscription) you can play with this [GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5CQsMRvyT-international-football-explorer) I created to explore a dataset on International Football Games (aka soccer ;) ).\n\nWhat makes it strong:\n\n* Interact in simple English, no coding required\n* Long context: you can iterate on a plot or analysis as chatGPT keeps memory of the past context\n* Capacity to generate plots or run some data processing thanks to its capacity to write and execute Python code.\n* You can use ChatGPT's \"knowledge\" to comment on what you observe and give you some hints on trends you observe\n\nI'm personally quite impressed, the results are most of the time correct (you can check the code it generated). Provided the tech was only released a year ago, this is very promising and I can easily imagine such natural language interface being implemented in traditional BI platforms like Tableau or Looker.\n\nIt is of course not perfect and we should be cautious when using it. Here are some caveats:\n\n* It struggles with more advanced requests like creating a model. It usually needs mulitple iteration and some technical guidance (e.g. indicating which model to choose) to get to a reasonable result.\n* It can make some mistakes that you won't catch unless you have a good understanding of the dataset or check the code (e.g. at some point it ran an analysis on a subset that it generated for a previous analysis while I wanted to run it on the whole dataset). You need to be extra careful with the instructions you give it and double checking the results\n* You need to manually upload the datasets for now, which makes non-technical persons still dependent on someone to pull the data for them. Integration with external databases or external apps connected to multiple APIs will soon come to fix that, it is only an integration issue.\n\nIt will definitely not take our jobs tomorrow but it will make business stakeholders less reliant on technical persons and might slightly reduce the need for data analysts (the same way tools like Midjourney reduce a bit the dependence on artists for some specific tasks, or ChatGPT for Copywriters).\n\nBelow are some examples of how you can easily require for a plot to be created with a first interpretation.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nyts2e5verzb1.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781a00caf22a3baae08cff12aa4f632c4e2f6f37\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j4nkz5verzb1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fb228e7d5e0d49ab01fc5487a6e093dd2fbd5d0\n\n  \n", "author_fullname": "t2_eu3yx", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "ChatGPT becomes a serious contender for exploratory data analysis", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "tooling", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"nyts2e5verzb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 164, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nyts2e5verzb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f760c0141478d32a8c8277a02f95c5e29a05444"}, {"y": 328, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nyts2e5verzb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d743d87575b1e0f5548e55bfb64917e6b1ac0b"}, {"y": 486, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nyts2e5verzb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e541e82d60882be2d90da174de9fd06bd912401c"}], "s": {"y": 784, "x": 516, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nyts2e5verzb1.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781a00caf22a3baae08cff12aa4f632c4e2f6f37"}, "id": "nyts2e5verzb1"}, "0j4nkz5verzb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 112, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j4nkz5verzb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a6e2d820d8a315af8eef4d95411c177b35fec73"}, {"y": 225, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j4nkz5verzb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d581131adaa235bbd0ed181d66af00c720f6ab5b"}, {"y": 333, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j4nkz5verzb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57da6cec30c657b632a15f0ca1410948eac48ea3"}, {"y": 666, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j4nkz5verzb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0b8f700683252ffa6a05ba96b5ed3d9c84cc3c"}], "s": {"y": 749, "x": 719, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j4nkz5verzb1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fb228e7d5e0d49ab01fc5487a6e093dd2fbd5d0"}, "id": "0j4nkz5verzb1"}}, "name": "t3_17t04cn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 107, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tools", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 107, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Gi_MqvkkPE7Mv0EhRP3ItZFzSqta3F_AvmSnKiNGTfA.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1699726304.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You likely heard about the recent ChatGPT updates with the possibility to create assistants (aka GPTs) with code generation and interpretation capacities.

The library helps answer the following questions:\n\n* How do you map LLM responses back into web elements?\n* How can you mark up a page for an LLM to better understand its action space?\n* How do you feed a \"screenshot\" to a text-only LLM?\n\nWe do this by tagging \"*interactable*\" elements on the page with an ID, enabling the LLM to connect actions to an ID which we can then translate back into web elements. We also use OCR to translate a page screenshot to a spatially encoded text string such that even a text only LLM can understand how to navigate the page.\n\nView a demo and read more on GitHub: [https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier](https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier)", "author_fullname": "t2_w08ahc6r", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GPT-4 vision utilities to enable web browsing", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "meta", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17t4fvq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": true, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Projects", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1699738246.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanted to share our work on &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier\"&gt;Tarsier&lt;/a&gt; here, an open source utility library that enables LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-4 Vision to browse the web.
