I made this app with the intent to track hardware, computers, servers, cars, lawnmowers, you name it. I know this program has a LONG way to go. I've spent a little more than a month trying to learn and program all of this. This is my first program that's has to do with self-hosting. Any help, support, pointers are greatly appreciated. Sorry for all the comments as i play around with various forms/ai/examples I have to spell out a lot of what the program does. I was told that it would be like the aCar app (though I have never used it).

I made this app with the intent to track hardware, computers, servers, cars, lawnmowers, you name it. I know this program has a LONG way to go. I&amp;#39;ve spent a little more than a month trying to learn and program all of this. This is my first program that&amp;#39;s has to do with self-hosting. Any help, support, pointers are greatly appreciated. Sorry for all the comments as i play around with various forms/ai/examples I have to spell out a lot of what the program does. I was told that it would be like the aCar app (though I have never used it). Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false,

What I&amp;#39;m wondering is, is it worth learning docker and deploying all my services that way or should I just continue with the way i have been doing it for years now?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be running the various Arr apps, Emby, NextCloud, Qbit, Homepage?, and probably a few others that i can&amp;#39;t recall off the top of my head. Some of the services are accessed of site if that matters at all. I did briefly explore docker in the past but got stuck and my friend pushed me towards straight arch. Now I&amp;#39;m considering giving it another shot but wanted to hear folks here input on the pros and cons of either way&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "82508a80-05bc-11eb-ae09-0effb713859f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17ta9ed", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nightwish612", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 26, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/17ta9ed/should_i_go_with_docker_containers_or_continue/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/17ta9ed/should_i_go_with_docker_containers_or_continue/", "subreddit_subscribers": 290321, "created_utc": 1699755364.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "Ok, so when a Name Server has a TTL of (for example) 48 hours, that means a resolver queries the name server every 48 hours for updated records of that domain (mx, a, cname, etc), correct?

working with Game Server Managers for over 20 years. Back then, game server managers weren't as complete as they are now; most of them were command line-based in DOS for e-sports game tournaments or QuakeCON-style events, even from [**The CPL**](https://letmegpt.com/?q=cyberathlete%20professional%20league) days. Professionally, I work in Client Platform Engineering, and automating tasks is pretty much my day-to-day work life. I love it. This also means I script a lot, so I'm very familiar with all scripting languages, full-stack development, etc.\n\nAs of 5 years ago, I have been dabbling with more modern GSM (Game Server Management) platforms in an effort to run a server with my Guildmates and other friends who enjoy this craft. In this time, I have used several different GSMs for various purposes. Some of them are decent enough to run from a business standpoint, but none of them are something I would call a \"turnkey\" solution. I hope the community in [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) can provide more insight into other similar systems or platforms I may have missed. The main feature I am looking for in a modern GSM is that it uses Docker to store the game servers.\n\nFrom oldest to newest, here are the GSMs I have used:\n\n1. **WindowsGSM**: WindowsGSM was the first GSM I started dabbling with about 5 years ago. It runs on Windows (you can use it on Windows or Windows Server). The more memory you add to your server, the more WindowsGSM struggles. But if you just want to run a couple of servers to play with your friends, look no further; WindowsGSM will do the job. The community is pretty friendly and laid-back, offering a lot of help, even to the most clueless people in the Discord. The \"template\" for adding servers to WindowsGSM is based on C#, and depending on your scripting skills, it can be challenging. Nevertheless, the community has a few aces who come up with templates quickly as new games are released. There have been talks from the main developer about a 3.0 version that will be web-based, but it hasn't materialized yet.\n   - **Website**: [WindowsGSM](https://windowsgsm.com)\n   - **Plugins**: [WindowsGSM Plugins](https://windowsgsm.com/products/windowsgsm-plugins)\n   - **Discord**: [WindowsGSM Discord](https://windowsgsm.com/discord)\n\n2. **AMP** by _Cube Coders_: AMP was the second GSM I used after WindowsGSM. I had tried Pterodactyl, but the community literally punched me in the face, so I was lured to AMP by someone I had met in the Pterodactyl Discord. AMP is closed-source but, like Pterodactyl, it uses Docker to store and launch game server content. I have to say the interface is polished and looks different from all other GSMs, but if you want to build a store around it and use it for e-commerce game servers for rent, it's not going to work out. You will need to build that yourself and somehow integrate it into AMP. The \"template\" system for adding game servers is an absolute nightmare. They use something called **KVP** (Key Value Pair), which is a type of .ini file format. You declare a bunch of variables in it, some lines in minified JSON, bash, etc. I script for a living, and I find it challenging. Talk about an unfriendly format for server deployments. When you turn to the community for help, it depends on who you talk to; you can find a friendly person who is still enthusiastic or someone who somehow hates life and therefore finds your question beneath them, so they answer in the most unhelpful cryptic way possible. But among most of these GSMs, it's the one that is the most stable. If they threw away the KVP system they use for templating and built something friendlier (like Pterodactyl's egg editor), I would let bygones be bygones and build a platform around it, but as it stands, it's a HARD PASS. It's pretty cheap; I think I paid $25 or $50 for a network license that lets me host around 50 servers or so. Good for enthusiast level, but not for running a commercial platform.\n\n3. **Pterodactyl**: Pterodactyl is where I went next, and it's where I have spent most of my time. I had to grab the bull by the horns and use all my predisposition to get it working, and at some point, I did, and it was great. Then I changed my architecture to something more robust, and getting it up and running has been quite the challenge. But if you get over the outdated documentation and unoptimized installation sequence and can connect Wings to the Panel server, it's fire and forget and pretty robust after that. I have to say, from all the platforms I had tested at this point, Pterodactyl has promise, and that promise relies on someone else taking the mantle and carrying it further, to where the puck should be, not where it's at right now. Pterodactyl's server template system is referred to as an Egg, and it's pretty much a JSON file that contains everything Pterodactyl needs to deploy a game server into a Docker container. At first, it's intimidating, but once you get used to JSON, it's pretty easy to build an Egg, probably the least complicated of all the GSMs when it comes to that. Pterodactyl has a beautiful interface with a built-in editor that allows you to EASILY build an Egg for your favorite game. The other great aspect Pterodactyl has is the **Support Bot** in their Discord. The devs built an entire infrastructure to allow you to paste your logs via [Ptero.co](https://ptero.co), and if you paste that pastebin (it's in hastebin), then **Support Bot** spits out a pretty precise answer as to what your problem might be. If it's a problem that is a textbook example, then you will be in luck as **Support Bot** will take care of you. But if this problem lies in different features or integrations like _cough_ **cloudflare** _cough_ or _cough_ **cors errors** _cough_, then you will have to deal with the _human_ element, which is not too kind and will most likely turn into a toxic conversation depending on how thick your skin really is. Some people know how to properly provide feedback and logs and other proofs to ask a question, and if you do it like that, then it's most likely someone there will answer you in that same high-level line of thought. On the other hand, if you are a newbie and you beg for help: \"Help me, someone\" and don't provide logs, well yeah, it gets rough. The other Achilles' heel of Pterodactyl is the documentation. It's rough. Like... really bad, in terms of coverage. It could be so much more and properly answer some of the biggest questions when it comes to common issues. It really needs work.\n   - **Website**: [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io)\n   - **Official Egg repo**: [Pterodactyl Eggs](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs)\n   - **Discord**: [Pterodactyl Discord](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl)\n\n4. I found **Jexactyl** by pure accident. It's a Pterodactyl \"Panel\" replacement, much more modernized and probably the best iteration of Pterodactyl if you want to run a commercial server that has Payment Modules, Ticketing System, Front-End functionality, an enhanced interface; in short, Jexactyl is where you think Pterodactyl would be if it were vastly improved. It's not perfect; the documentation has some \"issues,\" but it's nowhere as bad as its grandpa. The community is helpful, non-toxic, unlike the \"elder,\" and I only wish Jex would participate more. It sometimes feels like Jexactyl is a pet project that doesn't require his attention as much. But the community does really pick up where his ball drops. Once you are done with the installation of the \"panel,\" then you can follow the Wings installation instructions from Pterodactyl. But if, for some reason, the community in Jexactyl can't answer your question, you are better off asking ChatGPT for help because the second the Pterodactyl community gets a whiff that you are running Jexactyl, they won't help you, and the door will be shut. I like Jexactyl a lot, but once it ends its upgrading of the Panel interface, it doesn't do much more, and you are left carrying the rest of the sins of the father. But it's probably the best integration of Pterodactyl you will see out there until those folks from AnvilGSM finish their work.\n   - **Website**: [Jexactyl](https://jexactyl.com)\n   - **Documentation**: [Jexactyl Documentation](https://docs.jexactyl.com)\n   - **Discord**: [Jexactyl Discord](https://discord.gg/qttGR4Z5Pk)\n\nAll of the above server platforms are pretty decent, but you can\u2019t really use them as a turnkey solution for starting a business in the realm of Game Server Management, with the exception probably of AMP or Jexactyl.\n\nI wish there was a version of Portainer that was optimized and conceived with Game Server management in mind because with their robustness and service, I\u2019d put my money right there, but it needs a lot of work to entertain that idea.\n\nAre there any Game Server Management platforms that are in the same realm as these above?
