Before I start this new chapter, I wanted to set down my thoughts on what I did to get here. My background is pretty weird so this path won\u2019t work for everyone, but I just wanted to write it down, because it would have been helpful to my previous self 2 years ago, so may be helpful to someone else.\n\nPREFACE:\n\n* Don\u2019t do this, if you hate coding. You may not know this yet. Try a few python courses, and if you absolutely HATE IT, you should find another calling. Feeling confused and feeling that it is hard is NORMAL. \u201cConfusion is the sweat of learning.\u201d \u2014 Richard Feynman. It is hard for EVERYONE.\n* Don\u2019t do this, if you are not ready to learn about why statistics are useful. You don\u2019t have to be a stats genius at all. But you do need to intuitively recognize and endorse that statistics are useful and want to be decent with at least basic descriptive statistics. I\u2019m not talking about probability, but you will need to be good with basic descriptive statistics. If you LOVE statistics, consider data science also.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n* DataCamp python courses up to intermediate level\n* Google data analytics certificate (free through Goodwill Industries locally).\n* Many many many youtube videos. If you don\u2019t know what something is, YouTube it. If you heard about something in a course you don\u2019t understand, YouTube it. Listen to multiple people explain the idea. It will help you grasp it to hear different ways of articulating the shape of the concept. It is hard early on, because you may feel overwhelmed. Keep after it.\n* Many LinkedIn learning courses. (Free through local library). SQL, Python, and database management.\n* Learn about cloud computing. I recommend doing AWS or Azure. If you can pass the AWS SAA test, you will be well-versed in many important concepts for data engineering. BUT IT WILL NOT GET YOU A JOB. To gain AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate:\n* A Cloud Guru year membership (pretty good, but I think there are cheaper options out there that are as good \u2014 eg Learn Cantrill).\n* Many many youtube videos about AWS\u2014 Be a Better Dev, Digital Cloud Training, ExamPro, Cloud with Raj, Stephane Marek are top channels, in addition to AWS channel\n* Coursera courses on database management and many other things.\n* Learn about database normalization. Find a project to work on normalization. Find a dataset and normalize it to 3NF in an RDBMS\n* Learn what the difference is between an OLTP and OLAP db is.\n* Then learn what a data warehouse is \u2014 dimensional modeling in star schemas.\n* Nucamp Backend Bootcamp \u2014 recommend. About $2,600.00. They will have you do DB normalization in this.\n* Data Mentorship Project \u2014 look into them. Not super active, but very good. If they don\u2019t do another cohort, find mentors. Only one at a time, but one after another. This is how I got the best advice and got my first job \u2014 a mentor had a spot open up on a team she was leading and the invited me to apply. I would even say pay for a mentor if you have to. I know that sounds distasteful, but think of it as hiring a coach.\n* Turing College Data Engineering Bootcamp \u2014 seems expensive, but VERY good value for your money. About $4,800.00. Big investment. Challenging. Good.\n* If you are not in a structured program, build projects. BUILD PROJECTS. Ideally find a real world problem that you or someone you know has and see if they have any data on it OR even better see if you can think of a way to find data on it. Then start doing stuff with it.\n* Go to all the conferences, meetups, and networking events that you possibly have time for. Talk to people, ask them what they do. Tell them what you\u2019re learning. Just be curious. It does not have to be weird. Talk to all the people you know who code. Ask to take them to coffee and learn about what they know. Ask stupid questions.\n* Work every single day except 1 day off on a project. LOSE ALL YOUR OTHER NON PRODUCTIVE HABITS. I gave up TV and video games and hanging out with friends to find time. Change your mind: one type of work is a break from another type of work.\n* Learn to view coding as fun. Do not look for solutions. Look for new errors in your code. Don\u2019t be so arrogant as to think your code will work the first time you run it. Say to yourself, \u201cJust show me the next error.\u201d\n* \u201cFall in love with the problem, not the solution.\u201d -Uri Levine.\n* \u201cThe obstacle is the way.\u201d \u2014 Buddhist(?) saying\n* Listen to podcasts about DE \u2014 Joe Reis Show is my favorite. Datacamp has a pretty good podcast also for general data. It is useful to be conversant in how the tools work roughly. But don\u2019t go off on tangents studying new tools.

Before I start this new chapter, I wanted to set down my thoughts on what I did to get here. My background is pretty weird so this path won\u2019t work for everyone, but I just wanted to write it down, because it would have been helpful to my previous self 2 years ago, so may be helpful to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PREFACE:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t do this, if you hate coding. You may not know this yet. Try a few python courses, and if you absolutely HATE IT, you should find another calling. Feeling confused and feeling that it is hard is NORMAL. \u201cConfusion is the sweat of learning.\u201d \u2014 Richard Feynman. It is hard for EVERYONE.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t do this, if you are not ready to learn about why statistics are useful. You don\u2019t have to be a stats genius at all. But you do need to intuitively recognize and endorse that statistics are useful and want to be decent with at least basic descriptive statistics. I\u2019m not talking about probability, but you will need to be good with basic descriptive statistics. If you LOVE statistics, consider data science also.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DETAILS:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DataCamp python courses up to intermediate level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Google data analytics certificate (free through Goodwill Industries locally).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many many many youtube videos. If you don\u2019t know what something is, YouTube it. If you heard about something in a course you don\u2019t understand, YouTube it. Listen to multiple people explain the idea. It will help you grasp it to hear different ways of articulating the shape of the concept. It is hard early on, because you may feel overwhelmed. Keep after it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many LinkedIn learning courses. (Free through local library). SQL, Python, and database management.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Learn about cloud computing. I recommend doing AWS or Azure. If you can pass the AWS SAA test, you will be well-versed in many important concepts for data engineering. BUT IT WILL NOT GET YOU A JOB. To gain AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A Cloud Guru year membership (pretty good, but I think there are cheaper options out there that are as good \u2014 eg Learn Cantrill).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many many youtube videos about AWS\u2014 Be a Better Dev, Digital Cloud Training, ExamPro, Cloud with Raj, Stephane Marek are top channels, in addition to AWS channel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coursera courses on database management and many other things.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Learn about database normalization. Find a project to work on normalization. Find a dataset and normalize it to 3NF in an RDBMS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Learn what the difference is between an OLTP and OLAP db is.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Then learn what a data warehouse is \u2014 dimensional modeling in star schemas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nucamp Backend Bootcamp \u2014 recommend. About $2,600.00. They will have you do DB normalization in this.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data Mentorship Project \u2014 look into them. Not super active, but very good. If they don\u2019t do another cohort, find mentors. Only one at a time, but one after another. This is how I got the best advice and got my first job \u2014 a mentor had a spot open up on a team she was leading and the invited me to apply. I would even say pay for a mentor if you have to. I know that sounds distasteful, but think of it as hiring a coach.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Turing College Data Engineering Bootcamp \u2014 seems expensive, but VERY good value for your money. About $4,800.00. Big investment. Challenging. Good.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you are not in a structured program, build projects. BUILD PROJECTS. Ideally find a real world problem that you or someone you know has and see if they have any data on it OR even better see if you can think of a way to find data on it. Then start doing stuff with it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to all the conferences, meetups, and networking events that you possibly have time for. Talk to people, ask them what they do. Tell them what you\u2019re learning. Just be curious. It does not have to be weird. Talk to all the people you know who code. Ask to take them to coffee and learn about what they know. Ask stupid questions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work every single day except 1 day off on a project. LOSE ALL YOUR OTHER NON PRODUCTIVE HABITS. I gave up TV and video games and hanging out with friends to find time. Change your mind: one type of work is a break from another type of work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Learn to view coding as fun. Do not look for solutions. Look for new errors in your code. Don\u2019t be so arrogant as to think your code will work the first time you run it. Say to yourself, \u201cJust show me the next error.\u201d&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cFall in love with the problem, not the solution.\u201d -Uri Levine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cThe obstacle is the way.\u201d \u2014 Buddhist(?) saying&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Listen to podcasts about DE \u2014 Joe Reis Show is my favorite. Datacamp has a pretty good podcast also for general data. It is useful to be conversant in how the tools work roughly. But don\u2019t go off on tangents studying new tools. Stick with python and SQL fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When your brain is stuffed, take a break and go for a walk. Especially around your neighborhood or a park if you can. There is good research that shows that walking through geographically varied places helps with memory consolidation and recall.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Every once in a while take a week and just do practice questions. I use LeetCode, Hackerrank, CodeSignal, and others but those mainly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Again, find mentors.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Did I mention that it is important to find a mentor? Of all the pieces of advice, this or networking are the ones that are ultimately most likely to get you a job. But you can only impress your mentor, if you\u2019re working hard, doing many of the other things I\u2019ve already written about.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "17n51ar", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "codeslp", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/17n51ar/resources_i_used_to_become_a_data_engineer/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/17n51ar/resources_i_used_to_become_a_data_engineer/", "subreddit_subscribers": 137708, "created_utc": 1699045433.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_56xhg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Our open source philosophy around SQLMesh and SQLGlot", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17n06va", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Blog", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "default", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "created": 1699032163.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "tobikodata.com", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://tobikodata.com/open-source-philosophy.html", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "eb739554-a7db-11eb-95d7-0ec0f8f30313", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "id": "17n06va", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "captaintobs", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/17n06va/our_open_source_philosophy_around_sqlmesh_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://tobikodata.com/open-source-philosophy.html", "subreddit_subscribers": 137708, "created_utc": 1699032163.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "In the start-up I work in, I have been everything regarding some research project that involved some sort of navigation/positioning.
