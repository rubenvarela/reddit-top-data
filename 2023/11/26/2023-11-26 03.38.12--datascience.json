But as you&amp;#39;ve probably heard a million times, the job market is tough and I haven&amp;#39;t been getting any call backs from the dozens of applications I&amp;#39;ve sent out. And I&amp;#39;ve also only been working professionally as a data analyst for one year so I&amp;#39;m sure that doesn&amp;#39;t help when I&amp;#39;m being weighed against plenty of other qualified candidate. Regardless, I want to keep trying because eventually I might catch a job interview or two to give myself a chance to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m really hoping you folks could help me out with is a strategy for applying to jobs or networking? Basically, does the community have any thoughts on a strategy that would give me the biggest chance to succeed in terms of moving to Europe for a few years? Also before anyone suggests, asking my boss to let me work fully remote is not really an option due to legislations surrounding the data we work with. That said, here are a couple strategies I&amp;#39;ve been trying so far but I&amp;#39;d be really open to other ideas from the community I haven&amp;#39;t given much thought to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Applying for data roles of all kinds to Euro-native companies?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Applying for fully remote data roles in North America and living abroad?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Applying for roles within multinational companies with offices in countries I&amp;#39;m interested in most to live in (such as France&lt;strong&gt;, Switzerland&lt;/strong&gt;, Italy, Greece, the Nordics, Czechia, or Hungary)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help from the community would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude42&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--
