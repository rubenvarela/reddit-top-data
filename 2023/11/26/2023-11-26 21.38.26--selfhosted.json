The result is that I am able to mount my 2TB share from anywhere I have internet and manage my files as though I was on my home network.

Also, you will not be able to access pre-existing time machine backups through Tailscale! Only the destinations that you initially added through Tailscale.

To do that, I had to add TCP/5900 to my server's Tailscale services (which is akin to opening up TCP port 5900 to incoming connections from within the tailnet). This is particularly useful when I don't have my M1 mac with me, but need to run Python code inside Spyder. I just turn on my bluetooth/trackpad combo, connect it to my S10+, jack myself into my tailnet, MultiVNC my way into my server and BAM.\n\n\\-MagicDNS deserves its own praiseful review. Not only did it assign permanent, simple domain names to all my Tailscale-enabled devices (modifiable), but it allowed me to configure my own DNS server for Tailscale-connected devices. I was then able to choose custom DNS servers for specific domains, which let me block FireTV updates without compromising my security (The DNS server used for that looks a little sketchy so I don\u2019t want all of my DNS requests to go through it) and also use AdGuard DNS without breaking Doordash\u2019s Dasher app by routing doordash-specific DNS requests to Google\u2019s DNS and not AdGuard\u2019s. Solid win here, as Adguard's DNS bricks the Dasher app. Let me know in the comments if you want to see my Magic-DNS configuration.\n\nEDIT: Here is a screenshot of my MagicDNS configuration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAjk20X31QI5BUiJ3KjYsJ3APYhOjlgX/view?usp=sharing\n\n\\-FUNNEL: By running a funnel (proxy) on my home server, I am able to access my dad's Bell Fibe TV channels through their web interface from anywhere on Earth - Bell treats my traffic as if it's coming from my home network!

I just wanted to be able to use a nice &lt;myname&gt;.eu domain and not have browsers or devices yell at me for having a cert issued by my internal CA.\n\nI use AdGuard Home as my DNS server and Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM from here on) as a reverse proxy. Everything is running in Docker containers on an RPi 4.\n\nMy IP is dynamic and I've been using no-ip to keep track of it, but they don't have an API which Certbot could use to create a TXT record when doing a DNS challenge.\n\nSo I went to Cloudflare since everyone and their dog seems to use them. Unfortunately, they don't offer .eu domains so I skipped this option.\n\nI spotted Namecheap in both my router's dynamic DNS list and Nginx Proxy Manager's DNS challenge list. I've purchased a domain from them before and had no problems, so I read up a little bit on the whole thing and everything seemed cool. They have a dynamic DNS service you can activate for your domain, so you can use a ddns client to update your IP with them. I bought my domain, set up the dynamic DNS part, created a CNAME record, then went to set up Certbot through NPM. Here's where the first kicker came. You need API access to be able to have Certbot create a TXT record and verify your domain through a DNS challenge. To get API access, you need to satisfy at least one of these requirements:\n\n* have at least 20 domains under your account;\n* have at least $50 on your account balance;\n* have at least $50 spent within the last 2 years.\n\nOkay, I thought, $50 kinda stings (yay, Eastern European wages) but I can top up my account with it and forget about renewing my domain for like 10 years, so it's not that bad. I did the top-up, activated my API access and here came the second kicker: you have to manually whitelist the IP address you're accessing the API from. So in the end you still have to keep an eye on your IP and potentially whitelist another IP every \\~60 days, because NPM won't be able to access the API otherwise.\n\nNow I probably have to live with this setup for at least a year (if I want to keep my domain) or cut my losses, try to get my $50 back and move everything elsewhere, maybe Cloudlfare and a .com domain...\n\nI realize I could've done more research before committing myself financially (the warning about the $50 part is in Certbot's Namecheap plugin's documentation), but even after reading all the docs I haven't seen the IP whitelist part mentioned anywhere, so I thought I'd warn others.", "author_fullname": "t2_7zxka", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A warning about Namecheap when using dynamic DNS, Let's Encrypt and DNS challenge", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfhosted", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_184fhrv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1701030080.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1701018840.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfhosted", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: My problem seems to be largely solved thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/jusepal\"&gt;/u/jusepal&lt;/a&gt;.

I&amp;#39;ve purchased a domain from them before and had no problems, so I read up a little bit on the whole thing and everything seemed cool. They have a dynamic DNS service you can activate for your domain, so you can use a ddns client to update your IP with them. I bought my domain, set up the dynamic DNS part, created a CNAME record, then went to set up Certbot through NPM. Here&amp;#39;s where the first kicker came. You need API access to be able to have Certbot create a TXT record and verify your domain through a DNS challenge. To get API access, you need to satisfy at least one of these requirements:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;have at least 20 domains under your account;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;have at least $50 on your account balance;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;have at least $50 spent within the last 2 years.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, I thought, $50 kinda stings (yay, Eastern European wages) but I can top up my account with it and forget about renewing my domain for like 10 years, so it&amp;#39;s not that bad. I did the top-up, activated my API access and here came the second kicker: you have to manually whitelist the IP address you&amp;#39;re accessing the API from. So in the end you still have to keep an eye on your IP and potentially whitelist another IP every ~60 days, because NPM won&amp;#39;t be able to access the API otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I probably have to live with this setup for at least a year (if I want to keep my domain) or cut my losses, try to get my $50 back and move everything elsewhere, maybe Cloudlfare and a .com domain...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize I could&amp;#39;ve done more research before committing myself financially (the warning about the $50 part is in Certbot&amp;#39;s Namecheap plugin&amp;#39;s documentation), but even after reading all the docs I haven&amp;#39;t seen the IP whitelist part mentioned anywhere, so I thought I&amp;#39;d warn others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "184fhrv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bem13", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 19, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/184fhrv/a_warning_about_namecheap_when_using_dynamic_dns/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/184fhrv/a_warning_about_namecheap_when_using_dynamic_dns/", "subreddit_subscribers": 294349, "created_utc": 1701018840.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "Hi.

High power consumption due to running three systems.\n2. Limited backups (currently only backing up configuration files).\n3. Occasional SD card corruptions (fortunately, backups have saved the day).\n4. The DS212 Web UI seems to get slower with each DSM update.\n\n**Proposed Solution**: I've been considering consolidating everything onto one machine using a modern Proxmox+Docker setup instead of running everything bare metal. Here's my idea after some research:\n\n* Get an ASRock N100-based mainboard with 32GB RAM, a 500GB NVME drive, and 2 SATA ports (for the two 2TB SATA drives from my Synology).\n* Use the NVME for Proxmox and create two VMs:\n\n1. VM for all the smart home/networking applications (migrated from the RPi4+RPi2), isolated into Docker containers.\n2. VM for NAS functionality (any suggestions for a NAS OS?), using the two SATA drives in a RAID 1 configuration.\n\n**Questions**: I would greatly appreciate your advice on the following:\n\n* Does my proposed hardware configuration seem suitable for my needs? Anything better than the N100? Do I need 32GB?\n* What NAS OS would you recommend for the second VM (TrueNAS, OMV, anything else)?\n* Are there potential drawbacks or challenges I should be aware of with this new setup?
