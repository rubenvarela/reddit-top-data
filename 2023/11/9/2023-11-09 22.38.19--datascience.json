I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist with a background in Electrical Engineering (MSEE degree). I have been grappling with the idea of pursuing a Master's in Data Science to fill in any foundational gaps that might be hindering my work or leading to sporadic instances where I find myself revisiting fundamental concepts. I feel very strong in my mathematics background and took a lot of courses in statistics so I feel confident in understanding obscure content that takes a moment for me to digest. \n\nWhile my MSEE degree has equipped me with valuable skills, I can't shake the feeling that there might be some aspects of Data Science where I lack a solid foundation. I just feel like I am missing that extra intangible 'secret sauce' of I do not know what. I'm curious to hear from fellow professionals in the field, especially those who might have taken a similar path or faced a similar dilemma. I have tried doing the IBM Professional Data Science certification boot camp program, but it was just a bunch of feel-good filler from my perspective and work experience level. Maybe I have imposter syndrome still all this time later leaving school.\n\nHere are a few specific questions I'd love to get your insights on:\n\n1. Did you find pursuing an MS in Data Science beneficial even after working as a Senior Data Scientist for a while?\n\n2. If you didn't pursue further education, how did you address any gaps in your foundational knowledge in Data Science?\n\n3. Are there specific areas or concepts that you think are crucial for a Senior Data Scientist, which might be covered more comprehensively in a dedicated Data Science program?\n\n4. For those who have made a similar transition from a different field, how did you bridge the gap and adapt to the demands of Data Science without formal education in the field?\n\nI believe your experiences and advice will be incredibly valuable as I weigh the decision to pursue additional education. Your insights could not only help me but also others who might be in a similar situation.\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time to share your thoughts!", "author_fullname": "t2_d0tvi", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I have a MSEE degree working as a Senior Data Scientist after 4 years of work experience and am considering going back to school for a MS in Data Science.

I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist with a background in Electrical Engineering (MSEE degree). I have been grappling with the idea of pursuing a Master&amp;#39;s in Data Science to fill in any foundational gaps that might be hindering my work or leading to sporadic instances where I find myself revisiting fundamental concepts. I feel very strong in my mathematics background and took a lot of courses in statistics so I feel confident in understanding obscure content that takes a moment for me to digest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While my MSEE degree has equipped me with valuable skills, I can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that there might be some aspects of Data Science where I lack a solid foundation. I just feel like I am missing that extra intangible &amp;#39;secret sauce&amp;#39; of I do not know what. I&amp;#39;m curious to hear from fellow professionals in the field, especially those who might have taken a similar path or faced a similar dilemma. I have tried doing the IBM Professional Data Science certification boot camp program, but it was just a bunch of feel-good filler from my perspective and work experience level. Maybe I have imposter syndrome still all this time later leaving school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few specific questions I&amp;#39;d love to get your insights on:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you find pursuing an MS in Data Science beneficial even after working as a Senior Data Scientist for a while?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t pursue further education, how did you address any gaps in your foundational knowledge in Data Science?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there specific areas or concepts that you think are crucial for a Senior Data Scientist, which might be covered more comprehensively in a dedicated Data Science program?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who have made a similar transition from a different field, how did you bridge the gap and adapt to the demands of Data Science without formal education in the field?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe your experiences and advice will be incredibly valuable as I weigh the decision to pursue additional education.
