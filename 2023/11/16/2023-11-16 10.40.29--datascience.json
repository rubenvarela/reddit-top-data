I&amp;#39;m not sure whether I&amp;#39;ll be hitting up against 36gb of RAM, but it&amp;#39;s possible, and I think more RAM is always worth it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theses last option (which I can&amp;#39;t really afford) is to splash out for an M2 Max with for an extra $1000:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apple M2 Max 12-Core Chip&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;64GB Unified RAM | 1TB SSD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;30-Core GPU | 16-Core Neural Engine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or for an extra $1400: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apple M3 Max 16-Core Chip&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;64GB Unified RAM | 1TB SSD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;40-Core GPU | 16-Core Neural Engine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;lol at this point I might as well get just pay the extra $2200 to get it all&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apple M3 Max 16-Core Chip&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;128GB Unified RAM | 1TB SSD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;40-Core GPU | 16-Core Neural Engine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think these 3 options are a bit overkill and I&amp;#39;d rather not spend close to $4k-$5k for a laptop out of pocket. Unlessss... y&amp;#39;all convince me?? (pls noooooo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know many of you will tell me to just go with a cheaper intel chip with NVIDIA gpu to use cuda on, but I&amp;#39;m kind of locked into the mac ecosystem. Of these options, what would you recommend?

I keep having someone turn off my apps, a face idk is on my base page, Noone can \"find or fix\" my phone but they could wipe out information I needed. Weird things and bad things I can't speak of keep happening to me. I think my now - I think cheating husband - husband who works with military and computer geeks as his \"team\" or worker bee's. Idk. Idk wtf is going on. All I can tell you is that I've seemed help from police - who tell him and ignore me -, hospitals - who won't write things down or say things are in my head and when i showed them that the blood work showed otherwise, they stopped doing blood work or documenting the multiple seizures I had, coming in via ambulance and just \"crazy\" because I went for help at a neighbors house when my phone stopped working. I was having MANY cars pass on a street that VERY FEW drive down and kept getting into a worse and worse seizure. I couldn't call for help and my husband wasn't home from a 2 minute trip after 30 minutes. When my phone wouldn't work, I ran to a neighbors house and told them he was trying to kill me. When the ambulance got there, they accused me of doing drugs cause I was drooling. I was GOING IN AND OUT OF CONVULSIONS. They were med staff and knew that but still.... I tested clean but had 5 more massive seizures through the night, waking up barely breathing. I won't repeat the comment my husband said to the incoming nurse when the \"lack of oxygen\" beeper, went off. He thought I was passed out. I was gurgling in fluids in my chest. They tried to put me in the mental hospital for saying what I said to the neighbor but the mental ward supervisor cleared me. The hospital wrote that I came in for \"evaluation\". They didn't mention the ambulance, the convulsions or the seizures. 5-6 seizures and I walk out of the hospital the next day as a \"schyc\" case? More and other weird and bad things have happened. I wrote a lot of law, abuse shelters, went to another hospital (yet he has to go with me because he drives). I can't get anyone I once knew to help because they were either told I'm crazy or are scared to stand up for and help me. I'm alone in \"our\" house all the time. My phone won't let me lock it with facial or biometrics. It seems everything I write is known about because I always seem to get shit if I say VERY LITTLE to anyone. Geek squad was supposed to fix my laptop but needed to wipe the whole thing. Now my laptop won't even turn on. My phone probably won't work tomorrow. I don't want anyone going to authorities about this. I've tried all of them. It's like there's a hand shake, and then I'm nothing to anyone. It almost seems as though he's driving me to be so depressed that I kill myself. I tried a month ago because I don't know what to do to stop this - I can't get into it and it sounds crazy when I hear it come from my mouth but I know all to be true, I just DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY. I came home after i took the overdose and went upstairs to bed. I won't say everything but one thing.... idk who was thinking what as i looked dead but they dragged me violently out of bed and basically threw me in the hall where i stayed for 24 hours as people passed me like i was apart of the carpet. I mean, I'm not important. I'm a nothing person on disability. I know he's living and cheating. After I caught them in bed together, he said, \"it was a dream\", \"it wad a hallucination\", knowing he has all the motive to try to create that lie. For 26 years I thought he was the best man. Now this. I feel like a blind idiot. But there can't be a huge network blowing me and my cries off because are 2 important gov. contractors. I am below poor but have gotten lump sums of 50,000 dollars 4 times and given it all to him to either make \"my\" perfect kitchen and the other $150,000 to him when his old company got outbid and his job was no longer there. He had to clear his credit and pay bills. 3 years he was on the bench. I got that money and turned it ALL over to him for OUR home and MY investment to prove - once again - that i would do anything i could to help. I've taken out THREE high interest loans and even got him his first good job when the only one he waited for 3 years for, was miserable and had to end. From there, they put him on another with high pay and then he got this job from his friend when his friend went into part time consulting. I just feel like if it weren't for me, he wouldn't be here today. But he doesn't appreciate or respect that fact. In fact, he undermines me. He said that - eventhough he makes 11 times more then me and should have an extra 3,000 every month - that he couldn't afford his nephews graduation present. Long story short I paid my high interest bill and spent the rest on his nephews present with the agreement that he'd pay me 1/2 back later. One part he paid wad with a 30 dollar calendar.  I make $8?? monthly. Spent $220. But come to find out the insignia didn't come in the box so I said we should go to this other store to find the box. We did. He bought the box, some buttons, an extra luetenits bars and a \"stripe for his cover. About $176. Now with the calendar, that makes around $200. I knew I'd be on the back burner and was just great full he bought me the calendar. But today, he tried to say it was a Christmas present, as if I forgot he owed me. Then he told his friend on the phone - I think he thought I couldn't hear him - that he bought all the insignia and we went half on THE BOX. So his friend thinks I threw in a pidly $75  and he spent over $300. That's not fair to paint me in that light. I guess he's been doing it the whole time. He said, \"why is what you bought and spent soooo important\". I said, \" why is the thought of your friends knowing what I bought and spent soooo non-important that you literally lie about it\".

I keep having someone turn off my apps, a face idk is on my base page, Noone can &amp;quot;find or fix&amp;quot; my phone but they could wipe out information I needed. Weird things and bad things I can&amp;#39;t speak of keep happening to me. I think my now - I think cheating husband - husband who works with military and computer geeks as his &amp;quot;team&amp;quot; or worker bee&amp;#39;s. Idk. Idk wtf is going on. All I can tell you is that I&amp;#39;ve seemed help from police - who tell him and ignore me -, hospitals - who won&amp;#39;t write things down or say things are in my head and when i showed them that the blood work showed otherwise, they stopped doing blood work or documenting the multiple seizures I had, coming in via ambulance and just &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; because I went for help at a neighbors house when my phone stopped working. I was having MANY cars pass on a street that VERY FEW drive down and kept getting into a worse and worse seizure. I couldn&amp;#39;t call for help and my husband wasn&amp;#39;t home from a 2 minute trip after 30 minutes. When my phone wouldn&amp;#39;t work, I ran to a neighbors house and told them he was trying to kill me. When the ambulance got there, they accused me of doing drugs cause I was drooling. I was GOING IN AND OUT OF CONVULSIONS. They were med staff and knew that but still.... I tested clean but had 5 more massive seizures through the night, waking up barely breathing. I won&amp;#39;t repeat the comment my husband said to the incoming nurse when the &amp;quot;lack of oxygen&amp;quot; beeper, went off. He thought I was passed out. I was gurgling in fluids in my chest. They tried to put me in the mental hospital for saying what I said to the neighbor but the mental ward supervisor cleared me. The hospital wrote that I came in for &amp;quot;evaluation&amp;quot;. They didn&amp;#39;t mention the ambulance, the convulsions or the seizures. 5-6 seizures and I walk out of the hospital the next day as a &amp;quot;schyc&amp;quot; case? More and other weird and bad things have happened. I wrote a lot of law, abuse shelters, went to another hospital (yet he has to go with me because he drives). I can&amp;#39;t get anyone I once knew to help because they were either told I&amp;#39;m crazy or are scared to stand up for and help me. I&amp;#39;m alone in &amp;quot;our&amp;quot; house all the time. My phone won&amp;#39;t let me lock it with facial or biometrics. It seems everything I write is known about because I always seem to get shit if I say VERY LITTLE to anyone. Geek squad was supposed to fix my laptop but needed to wipe the whole thing. Now my laptop won&amp;#39;t even turn on. My phone probably won&amp;#39;t work tomorrow. I don&amp;#39;t want anyone going to authorities about this. I&amp;#39;ve tried all of them. It&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a hand shake, and then I&amp;#39;m nothing to anyone. It almost seems as though he&amp;#39;s driving me to be so depressed that I kill myself. I tried a month ago because I don&amp;#39;t know what to do to stop this - I can&amp;#39;t get into it and it sounds crazy when I hear it come from my mouth but I know all to be true, I just DON&amp;#39;T KNOW EXACTLY WHY. I came home after i took the overdose and went upstairs to bed. I won&amp;#39;t say everything but one thing.... idk who was thinking what as i looked dead but they dragged me violently out of bed and basically threw me in the hall where i stayed for 24 hours as people passed me like i was apart of the carpet. I mean, I&amp;#39;m not important. I&amp;#39;m a nothing person on disability. I know he&amp;#39;s living and cheating. After I caught them in bed together, he said, &amp;quot;it was a dream&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;it wad a hallucination&amp;quot;, knowing he has all the motive to try to create that lie. For 26 years I thought he was the best man. Now this. I feel like a blind idiot. But there can&amp;#39;t be a huge network blowing me and my cries off because are 2 important gov. contractors. I am below poor but have gotten lump sums of 50,000 dollars 4 times and given it all to him to either make &amp;quot;my&amp;quot; perfect kitchen and the other $150,000 to him when his old company got outbid and his job was no longer there. He had to clear his credit and pay bills. 3 years he was on the bench. I got that money and turned it ALL over to him for OUR home and MY investment to prove - once again - that i would do anything i could to help. I&amp;#39;ve taken out THREE high interest loans and even got him his first good job when the only one he waited for 3 years for, was miserable and had to end. From there, they put him on another with high pay and then he got this job from his friend when his friend went into part time consulting. I just feel like if it weren&amp;#39;t for me, he wouldn&amp;#39;t be here today. But he doesn&amp;#39;t appreciate or respect that fact. In fact, he undermines me. He said that - eventhough he makes 11 times more then me and should have an extra 3,000 every month - that he couldn&amp;#39;t afford his nephews graduation present. Long story short I paid my high interest bill and spent the rest on his nephews present with the agreement that he&amp;#39;d pay me 1/2 back later. One part he paid wad with a 30 dollar calendar.  I make $8?? monthly. Spent $220. But come to find out the insignia didn&amp;#39;t come in the box so I said we should go to this other store to find the box. We did. He bought the box, some buttons, an extra luetenits bars and a &amp;quot;stripe for his cover. About $176. Now with the calendar, that makes around $200. I knew I&amp;#39;d be on the back burner and was just great full he bought me the calendar. But today, he tried to say it was a Christmas present, as if I forgot he owed me. Then he told his friend on the phone - I think he thought I couldn&amp;#39;t hear him - that he bought all the insignia and we went half on THE BOX. So his friend thinks I threw in a pidly $75  and he spent over $300. That&amp;#39;s not fair to paint me in that light. I guess he&amp;#39;s been doing it the whole time. He said, &amp;quot;why is what you bought and spent soooo important&amp;quot;. I said, &amp;quot; why is the thought of your friends knowing what I bought and spent soooo non-important that you literally lie about it&amp;quot;. And all these funny things Noone can fix and Noone knows who or what&amp;#39;s doing it.
