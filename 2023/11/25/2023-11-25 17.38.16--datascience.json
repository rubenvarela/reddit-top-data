I won&amp;#39;t name the company for sake of privacy, but I&amp;#39;m concerned that the job will be a lot of dashboard building, etc and not a ton of modelling, and I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;ll end up spending 6 months as an excel monkey. The job description mentioned modelling and explicitly had Python and whatnot as a requirement, but i was wondering if anyone in retail DS had any advice or experiences to share as I prepare to get started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(As a note, I do not at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; view myself as above dashboard building, excel, etc. it&amp;#39;s just not what I&amp;#39;m hoping to get out of the co-op, I&amp;#39;m looking to build my skills in modelling, ML, etc., so I promise I&amp;#39;m not trying to come off as pretentious or above that kind of work. I&amp;#39;m also very aware I wont be building giant sophisticated neural nets or anything crazy cutting edge like that).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b026063c-d780-11e7-aba9-0e030591a4b4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "id": "182zp6o", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dyljam2345", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/182zp6o/incoming_ds_coop_with_many_questions/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/182zp6o/incoming_ds_coop_with_many_questions/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1147716, "created_utc": 1700853474.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I am working closely with people with background in Sales.
