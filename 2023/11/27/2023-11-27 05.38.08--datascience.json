I am relatively new to this field and would like to get some feedback regarding the choices made, learn how others would have approached this, and how to deal with severe class imbalance.\n\nThe way the model is set up is the following:\n\nFirstly, I decided to only concentrate on customers who made one or most purchases in the past 90 days to reduce complexity and respect seasonality. In the future I would like to include more customers, as this reduces the customers a prediction is provided for by 2/3 and I think there is probably great value in trying to reach customers that haven't come back in a while rather than those that are buying stuff regularly. However, I haven't given this issue much thought, yet, because I focusing on other aspects.\n\nSecondly, I generate possible candidates per customers by checking what they have previously purchased, bestsellers by gender and type of product, and similarities between users/product characteristics. Additionally, I tried the Tensorflow Recommenders library, but it didn't really improve the model and hence, I decided to not include it for now.\n\nThirdly, I use a LightGBM Ranker to sort these lists by customer. Moreover, the data is split into train and test sets. Each set consists of 4 months, where the most recent month provides the ground truth and the previous three months are used for the retrieval generation. However, this is where the biggest issues arise. There is extremely severe class imbalance because relevance is evaluated solely based on customers who made at least one purchase in the three months, where the retrieval is based on, and who made at least one purchase in the most recent month. This leads to the model overemphasising on very very few articles that appear to be relevant. Due to the class imbalance most products appear not to be relevant given that simply not enough customers purchase items frequently. Additionally, the performance metrics such as MAP@k are also highly skewed because they are based on such few people. I couldn't really think of much on how to deal with that issue and would like to hear how you would approach this.\n\nLastly, I apply several filters to remedy some minor issues. For example, the model focuses more on quantity rather than revenue generated from an item. Therefore, socks and underwear are suggested often by the model because they are simply purchased a bunch. Currently, I am just removing items of category socks/underwear in excess of a given threshold. For the future, I am thinking about fixing this by including weights that are inversely related to the quantity purchased and directly to the price. \n\nSo, what do you think about my general approach?
