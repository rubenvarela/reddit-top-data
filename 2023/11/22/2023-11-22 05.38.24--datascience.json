WORK: If you have a hard job already, DON\u2019T combine it with a data science masters. You could literally breakdown completely due to stress.

My classmates who worked full time during their masters had very poor grades (some even dropped out). \n\n\n\n2. Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh\u2026.
