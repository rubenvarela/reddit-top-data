Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh\u2026.

The OpenMLDB community has just released a new version of OpenMLDB v0.8.4, The main highlights are as follows:\n\n* A major update on the diagnostic tool that provides more comprehensive reports for troubleshooting OpenMLDB cluster deployment issues, significantly boosting operational efficiency. The related features will be detailed and demonstrated in upcoming blog posts. Stay tuned for more information!\n* Support for compression in online data tables, which can reduce memory usage by approximately half. However, this may introduce some performance overhead (within a factor of up to 2). Users can flexibly choose whether to enable data compression based on performance and cost requirements. \n* Optimized insertion performance for online data tables, reducing latency by about 30%.\n* Addition of SQL syntax SHOW CREATE TABLE, allowing users to conveniently view the creation statement of existing tables.\n* Addition of SQL command TRUNCATE TABLE, making it more convenient to clear the data from an entire table.\n* Improvement in the monitoring module, enhancing the accuracy of latency metrics.\n* Support for ZooKeeper authentication functionality.\n* Upgrade of brpc to version 1.6.0.\n\nFor detailed release notes, please refer to: [https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB/releases/tag/v0.8.4](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB/releases/tag/v0.8.4)  \nFeel free to try it out, and discuss it in the official Slack channel ([https://join.slack.com/t/openmldb/shared\\_invite/zt-ozu3llie-K\\~hn9Ss1GZcFW2\\~K\\_L5sMg](https://join.slack.com/t/openmldb/shared_invite/zt-ozu3llie-K~hn9Ss1GZcFW2~K_L5sMg)) if you have any thoughts on improvements or questions!

They mentioned they were interested in hiring me again, but the conversation was really them trying to glean information about Startup B. I was pretty vague since I signed an NDA in exchange for good severance, but shared what I felt was allowed (I also accepted an offer elsewhere by that point so didn't really feal incentivized to be to straightforward).  I didn't follow-up with them (had accepted an offer, was getting married, etc.) but remained cordial with the HM.\n\nThat was about a year ago, the HM has left the company for an academic position and the only contact I have left is the CEO.
