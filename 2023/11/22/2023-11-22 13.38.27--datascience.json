I have previously interviewed with the startup in the past, but pulled out when I received a better offer (salary/position) from another startup (Startup B). I ended up being laid off from Startup B (the company had a lot of growing pains); however, a few months later I was contacted by Startup A&amp;#39;s CEO and the hiring manager I previously spoke with. They mentioned they were interested in hiring me again, but the conversation was really them trying to glean information about Startup B. I was pretty vague since I signed an NDA in exchange for good severance, but shared what I felt was allowed (I also accepted an offer elsewhere by that point so didn&amp;#39;t really feal incentivized to be to straightforward).  I didn&amp;#39;t follow-up with them (had accepted an offer, was getting married, etc.) but remained cordial with the HM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was about a year ago, the HM has left the company for an academic position and the only contact I have left is the CEO.
