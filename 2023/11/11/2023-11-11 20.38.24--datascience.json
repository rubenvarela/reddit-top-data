One of the GPTs provided with this update by OpenAI is a Data Analysis assistant, showing the company already identified this area as a strong application for its tech.\n\nJust by providing a dataset you can start generating some simple or more advanced visualisations, including those needing some data processing or aggregations. This means anyone can interact with a dataset just using plain English.\n\nIf you're curious (and have a ChatGPT+ subscription) you can play with this [GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5CQsMRvyT-international-football-explorer) I created to explore a dataset on International Football Games (aka soccer ;) ).\n\nWhat makes it strong:\n\n* Interact in simple English, no coding required\n* Long context: you can iterate on a plot or analysis as chatGPT keeps memory of the past context\n* Capacity to generate plots or run some data processing thanks to its capacity to write and execute Python code.\n* You can use ChatGPT's \"knowledge\" to comment on what you observe and give you some hints on trends you observe\n\nI'm personally quite impressed, the results are most of the time correct (you can check the code it generated). Provided the tech was only released a year ago, this is very promising and I can easily imagine such natural language interface being implemented in traditional BI platforms like Tableau or Looker.\n\nIt is of course not perfect and we should be cautious when using it. Here are some caveats:\n\n* It struggles with more advanced requests like creating a model. It usually needs mulitple iteration and some technical guidance (e.g. indicating which model to choose) to get to a reasonable result.\n* It can make some mistakes that you won't catch unless you have a good understanding of the dataset or check the code (e.g. at some point it ran an analysis on a subset that it generated for a previous analysis while I wanted to run it on the whole dataset). You need to be extra careful with the instructions you give it and double checking the results\n* You need to manually upload the datasets for now, which makes non-technical persons still dependent on someone to pull the data for them.

One of the GPTs provided with this update by OpenAI is a Data Analysis assistant, showing the company already identified this area as a strong application for its tech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just by providing a dataset you can start generating some simple or more advanced visualisations, including those needing some data processing or aggregations. This means anyone can interact with a dataset just using plain English.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re curious (and have a ChatGPT+ subscription) you can play with this &lt;a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5CQsMRvyT-international-football-explorer\"&gt;GPT&lt;/a&gt; I created to explore a dataset on International Football Games (aka soccer ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes it strong:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interact in simple English, no coding required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Long context: you can iterate on a plot or analysis as chatGPT keeps memory of the past context&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Capacity to generate plots or run some data processing thanks to its capacity to write and execute Python code.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can use ChatGPT&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; to comment on what you observe and give you some hints on trends you observe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m personally quite impressed, the results are most of the time correct (you can check the code it generated). Provided the tech was only released a year ago, this is very promising and I can easily imagine such natural language interface being implemented in traditional BI platforms like Tableau or Looker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is of course not perfect and we should be cautious when using it. Here are some caveats:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It struggles with more advanced requests like creating a model. It usually needs mulitple iteration and some technical guidance (e.g. indicating which model to choose) to get to a reasonable result.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It can make some mistakes that you won&amp;#39;t catch unless you have a good understanding of the dataset or check the code (e.g. at some point it ran an analysis on a subset that it generated for a previous analysis while I wanted to run it on the whole dataset).
