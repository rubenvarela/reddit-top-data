Was chatting up a smart fella who amassed a stack of 30.72 TB SSDs, after getting them on a fire sale from a datacenter that was upgrading to 61.44 TBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "20c598d2-b3f5-11ea-8f7a-0e7cd54fad9b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "17z2960", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Torley_", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17z2960/does_anyone_else_use_enterprise_u2_ssd_drives_on/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17z2960/does_anyone_else_use_enterprise_u2_ssd_drives_on/", "subreddit_subscribers": 713033, "created_utc": 1700415220.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "My apologies ahead of time if this post isn't flared correctly.

To potentially help someone who wants to do something similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some background info:**\n\nMy main source of data comes from Video/Photography, I keep a copy of all my work in multiple different places at different stages in the editing process.  However, my current solution which is a mix of cloud storage and USB HDDs/SSDs is reaching its limit, and rather than pay astronomical amounts of money for cloud storage or run out of USB ports I decided to design a storage system that would outlast my foreseeable storage needs and be expandable if I ever needed more. In addition to the Photo/Video data, I am also creating backups of old family movies, DVDs, CDs, Etc. (So I guess I got bit by the Data Hoarder bug LOL)\n\n**The Plan:**\n\nAfter switching between a NAS and a DAS in my head, I decided to go for the latter so I am less limited by bandwidth. (As my NIC is 2.5G and a regular USB 3.0 port is good for 5G) My current laptop is an Intel-based machine with one Thunderbolt 4 port. This would give me the most bandwidth to work with as speed is a relatively important factor as I can sometimes be ingesting 10-50+GB of data at any given time. I know that there are Thunderbolt/USB-C-based solutions that allow for multiple drives and expansion, but since they are pretty niche they also come with a hefty price tag.  This left me with little options. By the title, you can probably tell what I did, but I had never seen a NetApp Disk Shelf hooked up to Thunderbolt much less hooked up to a dynamic device like a laptop. I wasn't entirely sure it would work either, in theory, there was nothing I could think of that would prevent me from hooking such a device to my laptop. Also with the future prospect of of Thunderbolt 5 offering even more bandwidth to the end user, there is also a potential to \"upgrade\" down the line. So I quite literally said \"screw it\", and purchased the following items:\n\n\\- NetApp DS2246\n\n\\- Asus X IN WIN eGPU enclosure\n\n\\- LSI 2308 Mustang RAID Card\n\nOnce all of the items arrived I assembled them and hooked each one up one at a time. The eGPU enclosure popped right up in Windows, good. Next put in the LSI Card, being that it was a half-height card in a full-height slot, I had to bend a remove a piece of the PCI-e bracket in order for it to fit somewhat flush in the enclosure. I plugged it in and heard Windows chime, due to a device insertion, but I could not for the life of me find where this LSI Card was, and if Windows was even seeing it. After about two hours' worth of troubleshooting with a friend, I was able to see where the card was located in Device Manager. It was located under \"Storage Controllers\". It was also at this point I realized that on the one physical card, there were two controllers. The next thing I did was hook the disk shelf up to the LSI Card. Sometime after the original purchases, I bought two 3.84TB Samsung PM1633 SAS SSDs. I didn't even know those existed. I didn't want to go all flash but I accepted the risks and studied the ways of SSD failure. Now because of storage density alone, I feel confident in my choice.\n\nI installed MegaRaid Storage Manager and through that, I was able to see that it detected the NetApp but saw no drives within it. Someone else on Reddit said that the LSI Card should already be in IT Mode, However, that was not the case. the next challenge was getting the right firmware for my card and finding a way to flash it. This turned out to be difficult because finding the correct firmware was hard enough, finding a way to flash it was exponentially harder, given all of the variations of RAID cards out there. I will have to update this post to detail the exact steps I took, but it involved creating a custom EFI Shell from scratch on a USB Drive, creating specific directories with specific names, and copying corresponding files to them. From there I had to boot into my BIOS, disable Secure Boot (or at least set it to Audit mode), create a custom boot option pointing to the USB drive, and then boot from the newly created option. Then I was presented with a command line interface and was now in a separate BIOS specifically for the RAID Card. I had just used my own BIOS as a jumping-off point to get into another one. While I never imagined such a thing would be possible, I realized this was no different than booting a Windows installer from a USB, it's just a REALLY long-winded and complicated way to go about it. Once I was in this secondary BIOS I ran a series of commands (Which I will have to update later) and successfully flashed one of my controllers into IT mode. I hope to be able to make a video tutorial on how I did it so that maybe someone else won't have to struggle as much as I did. \ud83d\ude02 Once I re-enabled Secure Boot and got back into Windows, the two SAS drives showed up in Disk Management. I then put the two drives in a simple Storage Space and ran some tests. I was able to Read and Write at about 400 **Megabytes** per second, very solid numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Issues I have found thus far:**\n\nRunning Mega Raid Storage Manager will make the LSI Card crap itself and just stop functioning for some reason. I have uninstalled it since then\n\nThe Read and Write speeds are not where they should be. Each PM1633 should be good until about 1000 Megabytes per second. I purchased a second cable to see if it was a link speed issue and I saw no improvement. I tried different pooling software and had the same result. Interestingly, each drive on its own, will pull about the same numbers. This leads me to believe it is further up the chain of devices, however, because there are so many I am not exactly sure where to troubleshoot.\n\nThe DS2246 is LOUD. I am measuring about 67Db on startup from one meter away and 72Db. However, I am in the process of performing a fan mod. I am replacing the current 30W fans with 18W ones. I can go into more detail about this if anyone is curious.\n\nWindows will sometimes not eject the LSI Card saying that it is in use. Windows Storage Spaces seems to do OK with random disconnects. (I need to take my laptop somewhere) However, since it has been a short amount of time I can't be certain that I won't experience any data loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In Closing:**\n\nThis has been a very challenging but enlightening project. I hope that I went into enough detail that if someone is interested in doing this for themselves this post is able to help them. If you have any questions for me I would be happy to answer them. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve this, or fix any of the issues I listed above please let me know. If there is an issue (or a potential one) that you see that I am not seeing don't hesitate to comment either! I get the sense this community is full of genuine people who want to help one another and I hope I can repay that even a little bit.
