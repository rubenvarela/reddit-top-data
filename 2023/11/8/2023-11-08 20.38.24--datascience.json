Of course, these companies offer tech products at huge scale, and at least for SDEs, CS knowledge is a focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However,   many data science learning materials focus on the math and techniques for analyzing data and building models, with programming as essentially a  means to those ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As  someone  interested in exploring tech, I am wondering if formal study of  data  structures, algorithms, computational complexity, etc., should be  a  bigger part of my diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your answers. It&amp;#39;s helpful to know your connection to this topic too (e.g., recruiter, fellow candidate).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I take it for granted that folks need to know how to write maintainable code and use programing tools like git, unit tests, etc. By CS fundamentals I am thinking of concepts or design patterns that enable software to scale efficiently.
