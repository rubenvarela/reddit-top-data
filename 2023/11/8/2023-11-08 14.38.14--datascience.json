With the dataset, I created three datasets:\n- a sample dataset for testing\n- a training dataset of honest news removing the articles that were grabbed for testing\n- a training dataset of fake news removing the articles that were grabbed for testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there I went to train two models using LDA Model from Gensim, one for honest news and one for fake news. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ran the testing dataset against both models to get an output of values that are topics of the individual article and the similarity they are to each model. If the article is more similar to the fake news model, then it flagged for fake news/disinformation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is that is the fact that I created two different models turn this into a supervised classification solution, rather than a topic modeling solution?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "481ee318-d77d-11e7-a4a3-0e8624d7129a", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#7193ff", "id": "17pwmj0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AndThenAlongCameZeus", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17pwmj0/did_i_turn_my_clusteringtopic_modeling_project/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17pwmj0/did_i_turn_my_clusteringtopic_modeling_project/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1117892, "created_utc": 1699370461.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I gave this talk at PyData NYC last week.
