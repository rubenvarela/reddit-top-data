I have a dataset containing both honest and fake news articles separated into two separate tables, so I can technically label each article as either honest news and fake news. With the dataset, I created three datasets:\n- a sample dataset for testing\n- a training dataset of honest news removing the articles that were grabbed for testing\n- a training dataset of fake news removing the articles that were grabbed for testing.\n\nFrom there I went to train two models using LDA Model from Gensim, one for honest news and one for fake news. \n\nThen I ran the testing dataset against both models to get an output of values that are topics of the individual article and the similarity they are to each model. If the article is more similar to the fake news model, then it flagged for fake news/disinformation. \n\nMy question is that is the fact that I created two different models turn this into a supervised classification solution, rather than a topic modeling solution?", "author_fullname": "t2_8rwxp4x5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Did I turn my clustering/topic modeling project into a classification project?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "meta", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17pwmj0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Projects", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1699370461.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m in my first semester in my grad program for data science and I\u2019m writing/working on a research paper involving clustering/topic modeling on fake news and disinformation.
