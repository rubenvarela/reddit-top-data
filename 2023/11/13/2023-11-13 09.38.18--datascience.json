They have projects ongoing and want to hire freelancers for a short time. \nYou can meet them in these communities. Look for them on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Reddit...\nEngage with them, share what you do and soon you will start to get some interest. This type of interaction quickly turns into job opportunities.\n\n4) Write. \nJust create a blog and post regularly. Post about what you do, the tools you have used and so on. Better to post a tutorial, a new tech you tried out, a small model you developed. \nAll the successful people I know have this habit. They write and share what they do regularly.\n\n5) Put yourself out there and interact online. \nMaybe one day you share something and it gets retweeted, maybe you pick up a good SEO keyword in your blog, you never know. That's why it's important to increase your exposure. You will increase your chances of getting noticed and potentially land a new client.\n\n6) Be generous \nOnce you do the above soon you will be noticed and people will start to contact you. \nThey will not offer you a contract. That's not how it works. after all, they don't know you and they don't trust you. But something you wrote hit them. Probably they will ask for your help and advice on a specific issue. \nGive advice on the tech to use, how to solve a problem, how to improve their processes, give as much as you can, be honest and open. Say all you know and you will build trust. \nIt's the start of a professional relationship.\n\n7) Be patient\nNot all conversations will turn into a job opportunity. Sometimes they lead nowhere, sometimes there is no budget, sometimes it takes months to sign a contract. In my experience maybe 2-3 out of 10 conversations turn into a job offer. \nAccept it.

My role combines financial accounting with data analysis, primarily using Power BI. I bring a unique combination of skills and experience from the previous more traditional finance postitions in the industry to this role and in my time here have signifcantly uplifted the management reporting. I pride myself on strong problem-solving abilities, intellectual rigor, and a flexible yet methodical work approach.\n\nThe company is in a great position with significant growth potential, and I have great faith in our leadership team. I am eager to take a senior postition in the company and to drive a stronger data-driven approach in business analysis and reporting.\n\n**Immediate Challenges and Areas for Discussion**\n\nOne of my main challenges is developing strong connections within the company and I often feel 'out of the loop' on key issues.\n\nAdditionally, my role lacks clear definition, especially in terms of over lapping responsibilities with the incumbent finance manager who has been with the company for 15 years. This meeting is a crucial opportunity to address this, and I\u2019ve effectively been asked to 'write my own job description'.\n\nAnother issue is my tendency to get overly absorbed in project details, sometimes losing sight of the bigger picture. I plan to seek project management support to improve in this area.\n\nWhile I have strong technical skills and a good understanding of the business, I recognize that I need to enhance my interpersonal skills. I'm committed to the company and keen to succeed but need guidance on these next steps.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any insights, particularly from those who've navigated similar paths or have experience in defining roles and setting long-term objectives in data-centric positions.
