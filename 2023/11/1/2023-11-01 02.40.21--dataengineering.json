We insert the requirements into a table and then our ingest service reads from that table.\n\nI've just been inserting the requirements into the table myself with an adhoc script that reads from a YAML config made by our Operations team describing the requirements. They send me the location of the YAML and I just run the script to get it into the table.\n\nBut then I get this wave of shame that this whole process should not be manual with me running the script like this. But the other part of me says this is like a once in a year thing, just run the script. Who cares.\n\nI'm not sure what my question is but do you guys have any thoughts on this? I'm still pretty new and on a small team but have a lot of freedom at my job, so I get this feeling every once in a while about when I should do something more formalized and when I shouldn't since its completely up to me.

During my time at this role, I have quickly learned that I have far less of an interest doing the analytics of company data to make business decisions and am far more passionate about solving efficiency and data problems with code. I really have grown to love Python and SQL and really enjoy making tools to make processes easier for our teams. Because of this, I have begun to think that a career in DE is more related to my interests. \n\nSome of the work I've done here have included: \n\n - transitioning SAS projections into Python notebooks and automating Excel read-ins to speed up the projection process saving hours weekly. \n\n- Optimizing SQL queries and improving database structure, reducing redundancies and transactions to the servers\n\n- Using Git hooks and Python to automate versioning incrementation of Excel reporting tool versions and prevent out of date versions of reports from being used\n\n- Managing data deployments to PROD servers during the insurance bid season and creating a Python tool that connects to a Git repo to execute queries and loads such data into new/existing tables, as well as copying tables from one server to another. \n\n\nI know that none of these projects have been too advanced DE type projects, but I feel like they are getting me on the right path.  I, unfortunately, have no real experience with cloud systems, formal ETL tools, data lake/warehousing, some deeper coding stuff like linux systems etc. \n\nI am looking to move soon to get closer to family, and am looking to find something that is completely remote (current role is hybrid). I have applying heavily to largely Data Engineer jobs, but have been applying to lots of other adjacent roles as well including data analyst, ETL Developer, Analytics Engineer, Business Intelligence Engineer, Database Developer, ETL Analyst, and on and on. I can't seem to get any offers. I'm not applying only to FAANG, I'm applying to hundreds of roles. I've submitted my resume to r/resumes (check my post history) and have received other online help and I believe that it shouldn't be bad *enough* to be getting no offers and hardly any interviews. I know that now is apparently a bad time for the job market, but I can not fathom how if I were to lose my job for whatever reason, that it would take months to get a single offer as even a data analyst (which is how long I've been applying for positions). \n\nWhat I'm asking is for suggestions. Should I just focus on trying to find a Data Analyst role that focuses on ETL and data pipelines before looking for strictly DE roles? I've received feedback that I could land a DE role, but I have yet to get a single interview for  DE position. Is the job market really that bad right now? \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how someone with some DE-like experience could transition into a DE role? Do you have any suggestions on job titles I could look into that could be essentially a stepping stone to a DE position? Any suggestions on how/where to find job listings that I would be a decent fit in? \n\nfor context: I have a degree in Mathematics and am in the US. I work for a large insurance company doing lots of DE-like tasks using Python, SQL, Git, Excel, VBA, Power BI \n\nedit: I forgot to add, I am looking to move very soon if possible, so I really don't have time to complete a certification like one for AWS or time to learn Databricks or Snowflake unfortunately.
