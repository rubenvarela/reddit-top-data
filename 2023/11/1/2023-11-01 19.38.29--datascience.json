I watched the 30 min video at 1.5 speed which was mostly stuff like which buttons to press.\n\nThe day before I logged onto the assessment portal I reviewed the questions. I noticed that the questions were very generic but thought there might be some 'calibration' briefing before the interviews; it was too late to speak to HR.\n\nBefore the assessment day there was a HR call 30 mins before. It turned out to be just to check if anyone had technical issues. There was no 'calibration' brief. The call ended after 10 mins as the HR rep had to leave to chase no shows.\n\nI was dropped straight into a 'technical' interview 1 on 1 with the candidate. Although it was apparently technical most of the questions were very generic. E.g. Walk me through a project where you had to solve a problem.\n\nThere were criteria associated with the questions but there was no way you would answer them as the interviewee unless prompted. E.g in the above question a criterion might be 'The candidate readily accepts new ideas'. Given the short time (5 mins per question) it was not really possible to prompt for every criterion but I did try to enable the candidate to score highly but it meant the questioning was very disjointed.\n\nAfter a few of these there was the 'technical' section. These questions seemed to be totally left-field. E.g. you have two identical-size metal cubes how could you differentiate the material they are made of? Obviously this question is useless for the role and the CS-background interviewee needed lots of coaching to answer this.\n\nNext I had a soft skills interview with a different candidate. The questions again were vague and sensible answers would not meet the criteria.\n\nFinally there was a group activity and we were supposed to observe the 'teamwork' but the team just split the tasks and got on with them individually so there was hardly anything to observe.\n\nAfter this the HR bod asked us to complete all the assessments and submit them. Then we'd have a 'wash up'. The wash up was basically the place where scoring could be calibrated by discussing with the other assessors. Of course, the scores had already been submitted by then so this was entirely pointless.\n\nI also asked about the inappropriate technical questions and they said they didn't get the DS questions in time so had just used other technical questions (we were hiring other engineers/scientists at the same time).\n\nSo, as you can see, HR ruin everything they touch and hiring is a HR process so it's terrible.
