But as we marvel at these impressive models, do we truly understand the technology that powers and stores them? Enter vector databases \u2013 the hidden powerhouse behind the scenes. In this article, we'll embark on a journey to demystify vector databases, unravelling the fundamental concepts, applications, and their indispensable role in supporting and harnessing the potential of cutting-edge AI models.\n\nIn the world of AI, large language models heavily rely on vector embeddings, which are representations of data that carry semantic information. These embeddings have numerous attributes or features, making them complex to manage. In simple terms, the process of converting raw data into vectors is crucial to preserve information and relationships. To achieve this, we employ an embedding model that takes the raw data as input and generates vector embeddings. By passing the raw data through the embedding model, we ensure that the resulting vector embeddings retain significant information and capture the underlying relationships present in the data. This conversion enables efficient processing, analysis, and comparisons of the data in a more compact and meaningful vector representation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vector Embedding Process](https://preview.redd.it/5hufgl68z38b1.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c4c920aa7df454571a369d61481305f346295e1)\n\nTraditional databases struggle to handle the scale and complexity of this data, hindering real-time analysis and insights. That's where vector databases come in.\n\nVector databases are designed specifically to handle vector embeddings, offering performance, scalability, and flexibility. They enable advanced features like semantic information retrieval and long-term memory for AI models. Here's how they work:\n\n1. Generating Embeddings: An embedding model creates vector embeddings for the content we want to index, capturing essential patterns and relationships.\n2. Inserting into the Database: The vector embeddings are inserted into the vector database, along with references to the original content they were created from.\n3. Querying the Database: When an application issues a query, the same embedding model generates embeddings for the query. These query embeddings are used to search the vector database for similar vector embeddings.\n4. Retrieving Associated Content: The vector database returns similar embeddings along with the associated original content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vector Database Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/8eex0vfcz38b1.png?width=1399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2f82f2e9fde4705b747bf8e63f0ac3cc6a362f1e)\n\n**How does a vector database work?**\n\nUnlike traditional databases that match exact values, vector databases use similarity metrics to find the most similar vectors to a query. They employ algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, optimizing search through techniques like hashing, quantization, or graph-based search.\n\nA typical vector database pipeline includes:\n\n1. Indexing: Vectors are indexed using algorithms like PQ, LSH, or HNSW, mapping them to a data structure for faster searching.\n2. Querying: The vector database compares the indexed query vector with the indexed vectors in the dataset to find the nearest neighbours based on similarity.\n3. Post Processing: In some cases, the vector database retrieves the nearest neighbours from the dataset and applies additional processing, such as re-ranking using a different similarity measure, to provide the final results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vector Database Pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/9lbwserez38b1.png?width=1307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a32cf9e6fafdfb6ecb4b8544ca989b13d171224)\n\nBy employing these techniques, vector databases offer fast and accurate retrieval, striking a balance between speed and accuracy.\n\nIn summary, vector databases are tailored for managing vector embeddings, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of complex AI data. Their unique capabilities play a vital role in powering advanced AI applications and unlocking the true potential of AI models.", "author_fullname": "t2_hcskz", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title":

Their unique capabilities play a vital role in powering advanced AI applications and unlocking the true potential of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 125, "id": "award_611ff347-196b-4a14-ad4b-0076f2d8f9d2", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Faith_in_Humanity_Restored_512.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Faith_in_Humanity_Restored_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Faith_in_Humanity_Restored_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Faith_in_Humanity_Restored_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Faith_in_Humanity_Restored_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Faith_in_Humanity_Restored_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "This goes a long way to restore my faith in the people of Earth", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Faith In Humanity Restored", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/jlwc6uspakd61_FaithInHumanityRestored.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=08c73f1595b2f969da73ad8bf9fef83e9e3f79db", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/jlwc6uspakd61_FaithInHumanityRestored.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=58da3d6a8c678afc324db8ada6103e2e8b953bdc", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/jlwc6uspakd61_FaithInHumanityRestored.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=49a6559ef36478537654d37e2c929a6b9d512d01", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/jlwc6uspakd61_FaithInHumanityRestored.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dcb92afecb2d9b8c637f1b38344bec6a91873838", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/jlwc6uspakd61_FaithInHumanityRestored.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=23d55b0d7a762eef629b7ab829fb3250d0dc4746", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": "APNG", "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": 0, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/jlwc6uspakd61_FaithInHumanityRestored.png"}], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "aaf5d8cc-d780-11e7-a4a5-0e68d01eab56", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14ieyfs", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vishank97", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14ieyfs/vector_databases_101/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14ieyfs/vector_databases_101/", "subreddit_subscribers": 931312, "created_utc": 1687674778.0, "num_crossposts": 4, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "TLDR: What is everyone pivoting to?

Not sure where to post this but I think this may be the place. Anyways, I\u2019m close to finishing my master\u2019s in Computer Science, and the research works that I have done during the years were in data mining and machine learning. I did do an eight month internship at some insurance company before as a data analyst. I also have some personal projects. And that\u2019s about it. I guess I would say I didn\u2019t get a chance to do so much (full time work or part time work or internship work or a lot of personal projects) just cause I was focusing on my master\u2019s thesis and research. It\u2019s kind of hard for me to do all those things altogether at once (I unfortunately experience a condition that being tired way too much can cause me to experience some seizures). Anyways, I really want to be able to work as a data analyst or a data scientist for FT after graduating. And with the job market these days, do I really stand a chance? I so badly need a job as soon as I graduate (start paying student loans, bills, etc.). My research supervisor thinks I\u2019m a good student so idk what gives. I\u2019ve applied to so many companies and so many positions, got only two interviews and none have reached out to give me an offer. I have applied to almost 200+ already, it\u2019s been almost 4 months of applying (I did take a break for a while to focus on my research) but still I hear either rejections or ghosts. What are some things I could do to boost my chances? Should I tell them specifically my condition? Though I always tick the box of \u201cI have disabilities\u201d but they don\u2019t seem to care about those since they\u2019re for statistics purposes only.

Anyways, I\u2019m close to finishing my master\u2019s in Computer Science, and the research works that I have done during the years were in data mining and machine learning. I did do an eight month internship at some insurance company before as a data analyst. I also have some personal projects. And that\u2019s about it. I guess I would say I didn\u2019t get a chance to do so much (full time work or part time work or internship work or a lot of personal projects) just cause I was focusing on my master\u2019s thesis and research. It\u2019s kind of hard for me to do all those things altogether at once (I unfortunately experience a condition that being tired way too much can cause me to experience some seizures). Anyways, I really want to be able to work as a data analyst or a data scientist for FT after graduating. And with the job market these days, do I really stand a chance? I so badly need a job as soon as I graduate (start paying student loans, bills, etc.). My research supervisor thinks I\u2019m a good student so idk what gives. I\u2019ve applied to so many companies and so many positions, got only two interviews and none have reached out to give me an offer. I have applied to almost 200+ already, it\u2019s been almost 4 months of applying (I did take a break for a while to focus on my research) but still I hear either rejections or ghosts. What are some things I could do to boost my chances? Should I tell them specifically my condition? Though I always tick the box of \u201cI have disabilities\u201d but they don\u2019t seem to care about those since they\u2019re for statistics purposes only.
