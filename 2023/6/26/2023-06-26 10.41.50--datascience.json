I ended up doing a whole lot of nothing in an org that wasn't really sure where it was going. I left, which was a big mistake. \ud83d\ude2c No one wants to hire a college graduate that left their first job in under a year. \n\nThankfully, after my boneheaded move where I left a job before lining up another job, I got another job in the data sector. I wanted something where I would be in demand. When I saw data science it seemed like a good intersection between my two undergraduate degrees and promised plenty of leverage and opportunity. The company would only pay for 2 classes a year so I took it slow, another big mistake. \ud83d\ude2c The pandemic, and some other life things meant that I left my job and took a long time to graduate.
