Our team mission was to bring value to the company using data.\n\nJob was pretty chill, tbh I haven't been doing much over the 4 years. Mostly failed POC on jupyter and a lot of non-DS-related stuff (like dashboarding type of stuff).\n\nHowever, there was one initiative I took that resulted in something that was deemed valuable enough to be pushed into production. It was a mix of NLP/timeseries project which actually gave some very interesting results, although if I'm being honest, it is definitely not worth the 4 years of salary they paid me.\n\nAs I was asked to industrialize the solution, I had some help from my other 2 senior colleagues who introduced me to linux, git, docker/kubernetes, flask, airflow, and some good coding practices such as linting, testing, hinting, logging, classes and decorators on Python.\n\nThe thing is, they never reviewed my work nor made sure I was following all the recommended guidelines, and as I was overwhelmed by all those new concepts, I ended up just not following them, or not correctly at least.\n\nLike sure, I'll use git to track my code. Guess what, I never work with branching and just commited everything on the same master branch.\n\nClasses and decorators ? No that's too complex and abstract, let's just do it plain and simple.\n\nTesting and hinting ? Maybe later.\n\nCouple of times I have tried to motivate myself to learn all of this properly on my own, but although I have learned some stuff this and there, I have never reached that stage where I feel comfortable using all this, and always felt unmotivated afterwards by how vast those subjects are and how little I knew.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 months ago, my manager who used to be a technical guy but has been doing managing for quite some time now, and who for some reason always thought I was someone brilliant and creative out of the bunch (he led 3 other teams with a total of \\~20 people) was hired by a mid-size company to become their head of data. He offered me a position here as a senior data scientist which I took. He then hired a couple of other data scientists (they introduced themselves as MLE rather than DS) with about 2 YoE.\n\nThose guys are so good they are making me feel like a fraud. They are using git as if they invented the tool. The way they structured their code, using mostly classes and decorators everywhere just baffles me. They seem to have no trouble with devops concept (like CI/CD), API management, networks etc ... while I'm here struggling with the proxy of my VM just to reach the internet.\n\nI've recently discovered the joy of reviewing PR on github and boy it is exhausting to follow what they do. I basically have to google everything as they are using stuff I didn't even knew existed. It probably took me 10 hours to review a bunch of code they wrote in probably one hour.\n\nI am sure by now they see me as a fraud, and they seem to be both the kind of judging type (3 weeks in and they already had some heated arguments on software engineering). I think so far I was protected by my \"senior\" title and the fact that I have known our manager for quite some time now, but I'm expecting that this masquerade will not hold for long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm lost, IDK what to do. Is there a way for me to catch up everything in a short amount of time ?

No that&amp;#39;s too complex and abstract, let&amp;#39;s just do it plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Testing and hinting ? Maybe later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Couple of times I have tried to motivate myself to learn all of this properly on my own, but although I have learned some stuff this and there, I have never reached that stage where I feel comfortable using all this, and always felt unmotivated afterwards by how vast those subjects are and how little I knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 months ago, my manager who used to be a technical guy but has been doing managing for quite some time now, and who for some reason always thought I was someone brilliant and creative out of the bunch (he led 3 other teams with a total of ~20 people) was hired by a mid-size company to become their head of data. He offered me a position here as a senior data scientist which I took. He then hired a couple of other data scientists (they introduced themselves as MLE rather than DS) with about 2 YoE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those guys are so good they are making me feel like a fraud. They are using git as if they invented the tool. The way they structured their code, using mostly classes and decorators everywhere just baffles me. They seem to have no trouble with devops concept (like CI/CD), API management, networks etc ... while I&amp;#39;m here struggling with the proxy of my VM just to reach the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently discovered the joy of reviewing PR on github and boy it is exhausting to follow what they do. I basically have to google everything as they are using stuff I didn&amp;#39;t even knew existed. It probably took me 10 hours to review a bunch of code they wrote in probably one hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sure by now they see me as a fraud, and they seem to be both the kind of judging type (3 weeks in and they already had some heated arguments on software engineering). I think so far I was protected by my &amp;quot;senior&amp;quot; title and the fact that I have known our manager for quite some time now, but I&amp;#39;m expecting that this masquerade will not hold for long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lost, IDK what to do. Is there a way for me to catch up everything in a short amount of time ? I understand that a regular data scientist with &amp;quot;expertise&amp;quot; in ML is no longer bankable and people now are turning towards &amp;quot;full-stack&amp;quot; MLE with a software engineering background, who are able to manage the entire pipeline and  produce professional code that is robust, readable and maintanable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

So, the first thing using the transactions is separating by **days of the week.**\n\nThe thing is, this fast food company has a seasonality by-week, being friday and saturday the peak of the week and mondays the valleys. Knowing this, i separate the daily transaction data by weekday and the forecast i made calculate the following days by week day (i just use mondays to calculate the future mondays, thursday to future thursday, and so on...)\n\nKnowing this, to have a **representative estimate of every series of weekday data, i calculate a log-weighted average, having more reacently dta with more weight than past data.** The reason of this weighted average is that the stores hardly going to have the same level of sales than months or years ago **(important to considerate that there is no montly seasonality)**. So, its most probably that the store could have a level of transactions very similar to what they do currently than what they do in the past. So, for this weighted avergare, i use a Logarithmic distribution (p=0.95) to give the weights of every day.\n\nFinaly, i have 7 weighted average for each weekday for my stores. Now, the next step is...\n\n**2) Variation**\n\nThe WA i calculate by itself its the current status of the stores, but, for the future, the store its not going to make that exact value, because every store has a trend and cicles of sales.\n\nHaving again this separation by weekdays, what i make is a first diference calculation for every weekday. So, the data i have now its the diference of \"i\" monday vs \"i-1\" monday (in percent), and the same for every weekday.\n\nWhat i take to know the trend of the store its taking th **median fo diference** of every weekday. I don't use the mean, because the series of diferences its asymetrical (because there are a large amount of days that, for promotional or other reasons, some first diferences are like 100% up or more. For Fast Food, this is total understandable. so, for that reason, i use the median, yo have a more representative statistic of the first variation series. This variations, aplicated to the WA calculated before, its going to be my prediction for the next days.\n\nAnd not just that. For now on, i also taking some confidence interval, where the first variations could oscilate up or down. In this case, for every day i taking the 10 and 90 percentile to have a down and up boundaries of confidence for my forecast. So the prediction before could move up or down what i have in percentile 10 and 90 of the first diference series.\n\n**Finally, tidyng up all the calculation, i have a forecast for the next week.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is that my testing gives me a MAPE of 12%m which means for me that im near with my forecast, but i want to make it better. **BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, im having a problem in justifing my work.**\n\nSo, my question is (for everyone who take the time to read all my text, many many many thank you, really), what do you think about the method i made for forecasting sales? what other thing you would consider to aggregate to have a better forecast?

It&amp;#39;s a valid forecast method or maybe i could give a check to other methods that implies statisticals models like ARIMA?.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again you all&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "937a6f50-d780-11e7-826d-0ed1beddcc82", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14eo2xi", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bbmr__95", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14eo2xi/i_made_a_forecast_for_my_job_any_tip_for_a_better/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14eo2xi/i_made_a_forecast_for_my_job_any_tip_for_a_better/", "subreddit_subscribers": 928715, "created_utc": 1687297034.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I have a lot of product names and descriptions, and want to build a model that predicts a target label (Y).

No more new interesting projects, just very streamlined, and most importantly, really no chance for progression in terms of position and money. \n\nThat being said, I heard LinkedIn premium is the best place to send in applications and some even say that they get offers to them before even applying! How does that even happen? Do I need to have a really specified job role description in my LinkedIn resume? I also only have like 150 followers and no profile picture. I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing around my face everywhere but do I have to put one in? \n\nAnd finally, is 1.5 years enough for me to have a much better shot compared to when I first graduated?

I hit 1.5 years recently at my first job (the one I\u2019m in currently) as a Data Scientist but am looking to switch jobs since I feel I hit a wall with the current one. No more new interesting projects, just very streamlined, and most importantly, really no chance for progression in terms of position and money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I heard LinkedIn premium is the best place to send in applications and some even say that they get offers to them before even applying! How does that even happen? Do I need to have a really specified job role description in my LinkedIn resume? I also only have like 150 followers and no profile picture. I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing around my face everywhere but do I have to put one in? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, is 1.5 years enough for me to have a much better shot compared to when I first graduated?
