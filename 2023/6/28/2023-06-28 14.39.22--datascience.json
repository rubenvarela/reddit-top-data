I know that many people lurking here are trying to draw up pros and cons lists for going into the industry. This is a contribution to the cons column.\n\nMy current gripe with DS is that I have lost faith that the industry will ever be able to absorb data-driven decision making as a culture. For a long time, I thought that it's more about improving my communication skills, creating explainers on how the models work, or just waiting for the world to 'catch-up' to data science. These techniques were new and complex, after all - it would take some time for the industry to adjust, as a Gartner article might tell you. But those businesses which did adjust would do better over time, and the market would force others to compete.\n\nThis line of thinking completely falls apart once you go into the history of 'quantitative methods' in business decision making. DS is really just the latest in a long line of attempts at doing this stuff including:\n\n* Quantitative Methods\n* Operations Research\n* Management Science (Rebranded Operations Research)\n* Business Intelligence\n* Data Mining\n* Business Analytics\n\nAll these fields are still around, of course. But they tend to occupy a particular niche, and their claims to radically transform the business world are gone. They aren't the 'sexiest job of the 21 century\". People have been trying to do this whole \"Business, but with Models!\" thing for *years*. But it never really caught on. Why?\n\nDS is just hype, and the hype cycle for DS will implode and not recover. Or it will recover to the same level that these other techniques did.\n\nData Science isn't better than any of those other disciplines. Here is my response to some objections:\n\n* **Maybe they weren't adding real business value?** Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you'll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you'll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.\n* **But they weren't putting their models in production right?** Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called \"Knowledge Discovery in Databases\" and later \"Data Mining\". The ISLR of data mining, Witten's *Data Mining*, was first published in 2003. That's 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn't get you much).\n* **But they weren't doing predictive modelling.** TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it's so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - 'data mining' used to include it as a part of the study, together with other 'modern' techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.\n* **But what about \\[insert specific application here\\]**. Most of the things that people pitch as being 'things we can now do with data science' are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using 'data science' to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they'll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.\n* **Maybe it just takes time?** Wayne Winston's *Operations Research* was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.\n* **But what about big data?** The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn't really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.\n* **Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD**. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn't that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?\n\nThe marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn't justify the sudden exuberance about DS and 'data'.\n\nAs best I can tell, here is what is truly new in 'data science':\n\n* ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.\n* People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn't exist in the 90s.\n\nI think that this kind of 'operational data science' makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That's new.\n\nBut the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he'll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that's been around for ages. It's never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, \"data scientist\" will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don't know about outside of a particular industry.\n\nThe only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).\n\nMy take now is basically this:\n\n* If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That's great. That's the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.\n* If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a \"Management Scientist\" or, for that matter, a \"BI Analyst\" in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There's really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.\n* If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).\n\ntl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally 'revolutionary' and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they've had almost 40 years to do it by now and they're still suspicious of regression beyond the 'line of best fit'.

When I mean thoroughly, I mean I've contact hiring managers, current workers, read website articles, everything! In order to just get more glimpses of what I can be contributing with my knowledge and receiving in professional experience.\n\nNow, I don't mean the type of help like contacting professors for help (done it), contacting people on LinkedIn from that large bank for advice (done it, not as helpful as professors), looking up YouTube videos/Reddit/LinkedIn stories of past interns discussing their paths/experiences/whatever (done it), etc.\n\nAll the things from these contacts have ended up with the same things:\n\n\"I got lucky\",\"I go to this Ivy or this top 14 school\", \"I'm a math genius who won these competitions\", \"I did research with a professor\",\"Went to career fair\". (The literal only explanations for being in that internship role; I'm sure there are other reasons, but people ain't saying that).\n\nI need real advice. Let me tell you about myself.\n\nThat internship I want to work in is at a Federal Reserve Bank in either Chicago, New York, or Dallas (it's ONE internship but has multiple locations for some reason) or Citi bank in New York. I go to a lesser-known school but, weirdly, is well-known within the technology field for its computer science department, nothing else. I have a 3.5 GPA, and I have a recommender just in case - idk why I would use it but who knows! I am applying for the Data Analyst undergrad internship and here are the projects on my resume: (I don't know how to put a resume in here, I'm physically young, but mentally old for that - weird for a tech major, anyway.)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Before reading, the requirements for these types of internships could be (not literally) \"have good communication skills; know Microsoft 365; be openminded; know R! uwu :)\" Like that's not enough as requirements.\n\nWork Experience (minimal description, description is not as important): Lifeguard supervisor (30+ hrs/week, I have summer school - didn't fail a class, just trying to get ahead - so not full time); CPR and AED Certified; manages lifeguard schedules and current lifeguards on duty; checks and maintains emergency equipment; diffuses confrontations between pool clients. (This is my only true work experience and it shows I can commit and can hold a leadership role; I've tried contacting any school/bank/hospital within my area for unpaid research opportunities with or without data science, no luck!)\n\n\\---------------------------------Data Science Resume:-------------------------------------\n\nApplications: Microsoft 365, Github, RStudio, VSCode, Google Colab\n\nLanguages: R, Python (I know some Java, JavaScript but I don't think it's relevant for these internships).\n\nDatabase: MongoDB, Hadoop,\n\nProjects:\n\n1. Local Region Car Dataset Project : Utilized R to present specific findings on dataset attributes. Findings consist of searching which car models were most popular in certain years, which years produced the most cars that had an average highway mileage above the median of the highway mileage dataset, etc. (This is not what I exactly put, but it is a \\~good\\~ description of the project.) Grew my knowledge of RStudio and R. I mirrored the aspect of finding very specific data with past Data Scientists that I've spoken to, most notably, a Data Scientist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who worked to find a correlation between Climate Change and someone's credit score (not kidding).\n2. Insurance Cost Prediction Model: Utilized Google Colab, Python, Regression and kNN algorithms to present findings on insurance data from 3000+ individuals from different regions of the United States. Utilized one-hot encoding, train/test split, and confusion matrices for precision and recall. I made 2 different sides of these projects to differentiate when regression starts/ends and when kNN ends/starts. Grew my knowledge of Google Colab, Python , cleaning and managing data. You may be asking, how could I use kNN when the target data is continuous? Great answer, the data wasn't skewed so much so I used the mean of the insurance cost attribute and one-hot encoded that. Basically, the mean was \\~3600$ so anything below was 0 and anything at 3600 or above is 1. The goal was to see if the machine could predict if a person was this age, from this region, was a smoker, etc., was going to have a higher insurance cost. My important finding was that someone who was a smoker compared to someone who wasn't - hailing from the same region, sex, age - would have a higher insurance cost. That may seem obvious but now I have data to prove it.\n3. This project is just to show off my software engineering skills. Created a full stack website utilizing React, Express.js, and MongoDB (database). Implemented scalable features for frontend while creating routes for throwing errors, processing CRUD operations from database to frontend, used cookies for authentication purposes, and building my knowledge of JavaScript.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*The resume descriptions of each job/project are not verbatim, they are simply the bones of the descriptions in my resume.\n\nI have some more, but I am thinking these are enough.\n\nHere's where I need advice: Is this enough? Enough for the banks? Are the data science projects so elementary it's laughable? Will I have to work with deep convolutional neural networking or some other crazy stuff to be a fly on the wall for this internship? Tell me your thoughts; my skin is THICK and will not go against criticism.\n\nPlease tell me your thoughts; they will be so helpful.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Bully me - thanks", "author_fullname": "t2_a1tbvl0b", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "This post is a safe-space for critics: Advice for applying for large-bank internships", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_14kyd04", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.17, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1687922783.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I posted this in the wrong spot - sorry luv.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello to everyone reading,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to be blunt, I need help applying for two major internships that I have so thoroughly researched and have become very interested in working in. When I mean thoroughly, I mean I&amp;#39;ve contact hiring managers, current workers, read website articles, everything! In order to just get more glimpses of what I can be contributing with my knowledge and receiving in professional experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#39;t mean the type of help like contacting professors for help (done it), contacting people on LinkedIn from that large bank for advice (done it, not as helpful as professors), looking up YouTube videos/Reddit/LinkedIn stories of past interns discussing their paths/experiences/whatever (done it), etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the things from these contacts have ended up with the same things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I got lucky&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;I go to this Ivy or this top 14 school&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a math genius who won these competitions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I did research with a professor&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Went to career fair&amp;quot;. (The literal only explanations for being in that internship role; I&amp;#39;m sure there are other reasons, but people ain&amp;#39;t saying that).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need real advice. Let me tell you about myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That internship I want to work in is at a Federal Reserve Bank in either Chicago, New York, or Dallas (it&amp;#39;s ONE internship but has multiple locations for some reason) or Citi bank in New York. I go to a lesser-known school but, weirdly, is well-known within the technology field for its computer science department, nothing else. I have a 3.5 GPA, and I have a recommender just in case - idk why I would use it but who knows!
