I was laid off during the massive layoffs at the end of April. Since then, I have found it difficult to secure a remote Data Scientist position in the US as a contractor (currently residing in Latin America).\n\n1) Most US non-residents open positions I have found are only US-remote (for US residents), or for Data Engineers, heavy MLE roles, or Sofware Developers with React/Node.js. Is that right or am I looking in the wrong place?\n\n2) I am wondering if it's my CV/profile or if it's the US market for contractors/non-US residents. Are there any hiring managers who can provide their opinions? \n\n3) Given my profile, what do you recommend me to work with looking into the future? If it's MLOps, could you give a small path/guideline?\n\nHere is a summary of my profile: \n\n**Strengths**:\n\n* Over 4 years of experience in designing and developing end-to-end ML models, with a total of 5 years in Data Analytics-related roles.\n* My undergraduate degree combines backgrounds in Engineering and Business Administration. To fill in some gaps in statistics, I completed the MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science from MIT (highly recommended if you lack a stats background, but you need good maths background).\n* My specialization lies in defining and transforming business problems into machine-learning solutions.\n* I excel at explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. I have received positive feedback on how easy it is to follow my presentations, showcasing my thinking and decision process while developing an ML model and receiving and including input from non-technical folks.\n* I have experience coaching junior Data Scientists/Analysts from both technical and business applications perspectives, teaching them how to identify and solve business opportunities/problems using ML.\n* Most of my projects have involved tree-based models, as they are easier to explain to non-technical stakeholders and convince them to use/adopt the final ML model. I also have experience with time-series analysis, Reinforcement Learning/Hidden Markov Models, and a bit with recommendation systems.\n* I have worked in the insurance, banking, advertising, retail, and aeronautics industries.\n* I am proficient in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.\n* I get things done. This is the stuff I most like about Data Science: Sometimes I will face a business problem where I don't have the answer so I go into research for a good solution proposal.\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n\n* I do not possess a Master's or PhD degree (The MicroMasters from MIT I don't think counts as a full-master degree)\n* non-US resident? does it affect me even as a contractor? (Because I don't require a VISA to work as a contractor)\n* I have below-average experience using cloud platforms, with only one year of experience using GCP. Consequently, I am pursuing the Data Scientist Associate Certificate from Azure (DP-100).\n* Never used Spark/Hadoop or any kind of distributed computing/storage.\n* Although I have no direct experience with NLP, deep neural networks, or Computer Vision, I have achieved top-three rankings in internal NLP competitions (but it was three years ago). Additionally, I have developed an application using Chat GPT (utilizing the OpenAI API) to optimize business processes.\n* I have limited knowledge of MLE. In instances where I have deployed a model, I have typically relied on the support of an MLE. I have been attempting to gain a better understanding of this field, but the multitude of tools available often overwhelms me, and it is very challenging to gain practical experience. I feel that studying without practice is a waste of time, especially considering the multitude of tools available for various MLE problems. It becomes even more challenging when different companies utilize and demand distinct sets of tools for the same MLE problem.

I was laid off during the massive layoffs at the end of April. Since then, I have found it difficult to secure a remote Data Scientist position in the US as a contractor (currently residing in Latin America).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Most US non-residents open positions I have found are only US-remote (for US residents), or for Data Engineers, heavy MLE roles, or Sofware Developers with React/Node.js. Is that right or am I looking in the wrong place?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I am wondering if it&amp;#39;s my CV/profile or if it&amp;#39;s the US market for contractors/non-US residents. Are there any hiring managers who can provide their opinions? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Given my profile, what do you recommend me to work with looking into the future? If it&amp;#39;s MLOps, could you give a small path/guideline?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of my profile: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Over 4 years of experience in designing and developing end-to-end ML models, with a total of 5 years in Data Analytics-related roles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My undergraduate degree combines backgrounds in Engineering and Business Administration. To fill in some gaps in statistics, I completed the MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science from MIT (highly recommended if you lack a stats background, but you need good maths background).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My specialization lies in defining and transforming business problems into machine-learning solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I excel at explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. I have received positive feedback on how easy it is to follow my presentations, showcasing my thinking and decision process while developing an ML model and receiving and including input from non-technical folks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have experience coaching junior Data Scientists/Analysts from both technical and business applications perspectives, teaching them how to identify and solve business opportunities/problems using ML.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Most of my projects have involved tree-based models, as they are easier to explain to non-technical stakeholders and convince them to use/adopt the final ML model. I also have experience with time-series analysis, Reinforcement Learning/Hidden Markov Models, and a bit with recommendation systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have worked in the insurance, banking, advertising, retail, and aeronautics industries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I am proficient in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I get things done. This is the stuff I most like about Data Science: Sometimes I will face a business problem where I don&amp;#39;t have the answer so I go into research for a good solution proposal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I do not possess a Master&amp;#39;s or PhD degree (The MicroMasters from MIT I don&amp;#39;t think counts as a full-master degree)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;non-US resident? does it affect me even as a contractor? (Because I don&amp;#39;t require a VISA to work as a contractor)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have below-average experience using cloud platforms, with only one year of experience using GCP. Consequently, I am pursuing the Data Scientist Associate Certificate from Azure (DP-100).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Never used Spark/Hadoop or any kind of distributed computing/storage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Although I have no direct experience with NLP, deep neural networks, or Computer Vision, I have achieved top-three rankings in internal NLP competitions (but it was three years ago). Additionally, I have developed an application using Chat GPT (utilizing the OpenAI API) to optimize business processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have limited knowledge of MLE. In instances where I have deployed a model, I have typically relied on the support of an MLE. I have been attempting to gain a better understanding of this field, but the multitude of tools available often overwhelms me, and it is very challenging to gain practical experience. I feel that studying without practice is a waste of time, especially considering the multitude of tools available for various MLE problems.
