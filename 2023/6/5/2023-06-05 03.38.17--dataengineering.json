Recently, I've been offered a data engineer position at a large tech company that is publicly traded on the NYSE. On the other hand, I've also been proposed a role change within my current company, from data analyst to junior data scientist.\n\nAs a data scientist, I would be working with ML and AI to improve our product, conducting research, and more.\n\nThe pay is similar for both options, so my first question is whether it's better to move to a bigger and more famous company. Secondly, I'm wondering whether it's better to stick with data engineering or dive deeper into data science.

The part that makes me Staff is that I act as a technical leader for business teams where there are analytics engineers and I am responsible for building out robust datasets on Snowflake. My scope rarely creeps outside of data transformations over to infrastructure, but I have built the ocassional Airflow DAG for sources without a Fivetran connector.\n\nI was approached by a small consulting agency to apply for a Data Engineer position. The job sounded cool and there are projects available overseas, which I really want! However I was very clear with them that although my title says Data Engineer, I am more of an Analytics Engineer, I do not touch infrastructure, than my Python knowledge is mostly limited to the data science frameworks. My interviewer, the CEO, said it's fine and that the coding challenge won't take much time.\n\nThen I got the coding challenge, which is to build a service that accepts POST requests, does transformations on the data and loads both raw and transformed data in a database. The service should fully run on GCP and shouldn't cost more than $10. It's honestly a lot, even my software engineer friends tell me it'd take them a few days to finish the project.\n\nNow I have never built an endpoint before, but I managed to cobble something together using FastAPI. My problem now is I've spent over 12 hours on this project already and because of other committments (read: I have a life) I don't think I have time to figure out how to deploy this. I tried setting up a Cloud SQL instance with a free account and idk what I did, but I went over $10 already before I realized that you get charged even if your instance is idle.\n\nI guess my question is: should I continue pursuing this position? I feel like it's not fair to be evaluated on skills I don't have. Sure I get the whole \"willingness to learn\" thing but some people don't have all week to do coding challenges, especially if the use case and frameworks are new to them?

The part that makes me Staff is that I act as a technical leader for business teams where there are analytics engineers and I am responsible for building out robust datasets on Snowflake. My scope rarely creeps outside of data transformations over to infrastructure, but I have built the ocassional Airflow DAG for sources without a Fivetran connector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was approached by a small consulting agency to apply for a Data Engineer position. The job sounded cool and there are projects available overseas, which I really want! However I was very clear with them that although my title says Data Engineer, I am more of an Analytics Engineer, I do not touch infrastructure, than my Python knowledge is mostly limited to the data science frameworks. My interviewer, the CEO, said it&amp;#39;s fine and that the coding challenge won&amp;#39;t take much time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got the coding challenge, which is to build a service that accepts POST requests, does transformations on the data and loads both raw and transformed data in a database. The service should fully run on GCP and shouldn&amp;#39;t cost more than $10. It&amp;#39;s honestly a lot, even my software engineer friends tell me it&amp;#39;d take them a few days to finish the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I have never built an endpoint before, but I managed to cobble something together using FastAPI. My problem now is I&amp;#39;ve spent over 12 hours on this project already and because of other committments (read: I have a life) I don&amp;#39;t think I have time to figure out how to deploy this. I tried setting up a Cloud SQL instance with a free account and idk what I did, but I went over $10 already before I realized that you get charged even if your instance is idle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is: should I continue pursuing this position? I feel like it&amp;#39;s not fair to be evaluated on skills I don&amp;#39;t have. Sure I get the whole &amp;quot;willingness to learn&amp;quot; thing but some people don&amp;#39;t have all week to do coding challenges, especially if the use case and frameworks are new to them?
