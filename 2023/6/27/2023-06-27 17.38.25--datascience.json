I know that many people lurking here are trying to draw up pros and cons lists for going into the industry. This is a contribution to the cons column.\n\nMy current gripe with DS is that I have lost faith that the industry will ever be able to absorb data-driven decision making as a culture. For a long time, I thought that it's more about improving my communication skills, creating explainers on how the models work, or just waiting for the world to 'catch-up' to data science. These techniques were new and complex, after all - it would take some time for the industry to adjust, as a Gartner article might tell you. But those businesses which did adjust would do better over time, and the market would force others to compete.\n\nThis line of thinking completely falls apart once you go into the history of 'quantitative methods' in business decision making. DS is really just the latest in a long line of attempts at doing this stuff including:\n\n* Quantitative Methods\n* Operations Research\n* Management Science (Rebranded Operations Research)\n* Business Intelligence\n* Data Mining\n* Business Analytics\n\nAll these fields are still around, of course. But they tend to occupy a particular niche, and their claims to radically transform the business world are gone. They aren't the 'sexiest job of the 21 century\". People have been trying to do this whole \"Business, but with Models!\" thing for *years*. But it never really caught on. Why?\n\nDS is just hype, and the hype cycle for DS will implode and not recover. Or it will recover to the same level that these other techniques did.\n\nData Science isn't better than any of those other disciplines. Here is my response to some objections:\n\n* **Maybe they weren't adding real business value?** Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you'll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you'll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.\n* **But they weren't putting their models in production right?** Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called \"Knowledge Discovery in Databases\" and later \"Data Mining\". The ISLR of data mining, Witten's *Data Mining*, was first published in 2003. That's 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn't get you much).\n* **But they weren't doing predictive modelling.** TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it's so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - 'data mining' used to include it as a part of the study, together with other 'modern' techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.\n* **But what about \\[insert specific application here\\]**. Most of the things that people pitch as being 'things we can now do with data science' are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using 'data science' to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they'll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.\n* **Maybe it just takes time?** Wayne Winston's *Operations Research* was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.\n* **But what about big data?** The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn't really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.\n* **Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD**. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn't that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?\n\nThe marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn't justify the sudden exuberance about DS and 'data'.\n\nAs best I can tell, here is what is truly new in 'data science':\n\n* ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.\n* People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn't exist in the 90s.\n\nI think that this kind of 'operational data science' makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That's new.\n\nBut the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he'll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that's been around for ages. It's never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, \"data scientist\" will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don't know about outside of a particular industry.\n\nThe only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).\n\nMy take now is basically this:\n\n* If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That's great. That's the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.\n* If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a \"Management Scientist\" or, for that matter, a \"BI Analyst\" in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There's really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.\n* If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).\n\ntl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally 'revolutionary' and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they've had almost 40 years to do it by now and they're still suspicious of regression beyond the 'line of best fit'.

Here is my response to some objections:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe they weren&amp;#39;t adding real business value?&lt;/strong&gt; Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you&amp;#39;ll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you&amp;#39;ll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they weren&amp;#39;t putting their models in production right?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called &amp;quot;Knowledge Discovery in Databases&amp;quot; and later &amp;quot;Data Mining&amp;quot;. The ISLR of data mining, Witten&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Data Mining&lt;/em&gt;, was first published in 2003. That&amp;#39;s 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn&amp;#39;t get you much).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they weren&amp;#39;t doing predictive modelling.&lt;/strong&gt; TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it&amp;#39;s so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - &amp;#39;data mining&amp;#39; used to include it as a part of the study, together with other &amp;#39;modern&amp;#39; techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what about [insert specific application here]&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of the things that people pitch as being &amp;#39;things we can now do with data science&amp;#39; are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using &amp;#39;data science&amp;#39; to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they&amp;#39;ll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe it just takes time?&lt;/strong&gt; Wayne Winston&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Operations Research&lt;/em&gt; was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what about big data?&lt;/strong&gt; The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn&amp;#39;t really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD&lt;/strong&gt;. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn&amp;#39;t that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn&amp;#39;t justify the sudden exuberance about DS and &amp;#39;data&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As best I can tell, here is what is truly new in &amp;#39;data science&amp;#39;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn&amp;#39;t exist in the 90s.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that this kind of &amp;#39;operational data science&amp;#39; makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That&amp;#39;s new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he&amp;#39;ll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that&amp;#39;s been around for ages. It&amp;#39;s never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, &amp;quot;data scientist&amp;quot; will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don&amp;#39;t know about outside of a particular industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My take now is basically this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That&amp;#39;s great. That&amp;#39;s the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a &amp;quot;Management Scientist&amp;quot; or, for that matter, a &amp;quot;BI Analyst&amp;quot; in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There&amp;#39;s really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally &amp;#39;revolutionary&amp;#39; and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they&amp;#39;ve had almost 40 years to do it by now and they&amp;#39;re still suspicious of regression beyond the &amp;#39;line of best fit&amp;#39;. It&amp;#39;s not happening fam.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14khdp2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Top_Lime1820", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 33, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14khdp2/data_science_is_a_fad_cynical_post_2334/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14khdp2/data_science_is_a_fad_cynical_post_2334/", "subreddit_subscribers": 932346, "created_utc": 1687881144.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am a graduate of a statistics masters program from last year who has been primarily looking for a job in data science/ML, analytics, or engineering for over half a year.

What if I run the predictions up to the logits and then instead of running a sigmoid function, I run SoftMax for the 2 classes instead?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially what I want to do is spot any mistakes in the training dataset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does what I&amp;#39;m saying make sense?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14keb45", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CanWeStartAgain1", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14keb45/examining_uncertain_predictions_on_the_training/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14keb45/examining_uncertain_predictions_on_the_training/", "subreddit_subscribers": 932346, "created_utc": 1687873780.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi, i recently switched to an airline firm and want to network with data scientist working in this industry.", "author_fullname": "t2_agqjjp6t", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Anyone working in airlines industry", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "network", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_14kd2vv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Networking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1687870674.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, i recently switched to an airline firm and want to network with data scientist working in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8addf236-d780-11e7-932d-0e90af9dfe6e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14kd2vv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CounterWonderful3298", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14kd2vv/anyone_working_in_airlines_industry/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14kd2vv/anyone_working_in_airlines_industry/", "subreddit_subscribers": 932346, "created_utc": 1687870674.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
