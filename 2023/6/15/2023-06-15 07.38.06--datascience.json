There are two important facts I try to keep in mind:\n\n1. A feature with high impact does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the target variable.\n2. The feature relationship learned by the model may not generalize well in the future.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider the example of a timestamp feature in an XGBoost model. The timestamp may exhibit high importance in the model, but it can lead to poor performance during inference. This is because the model hasn't seen new timestamps before and doesn't know how to extrapolate from them. The model predicts as if the new timestamps are equal to the latest timestamp in the training data. This example demonstrates the issue of prediction data having a different distribution from the training data, with unseen distribution points.\n\nThis problem of poor generalization can also occur when the joint distribution of the prediction data differs from that of the training data.\n\nI encountered this problem during the GE Flight Quest competition, where I had to predict future delays of US domestic flights. The training data covered a three-month period, while the final test data consisted of data from the month following the competition's conclusion. Weather conditions varied during those three months, and while the training data covered all airports, some airports did not experience poor weather. This posed a risk that the distribution of weather conditions per airport observed in the training data was not representative of the distribution at prediction time. I was concerned that XGBoost might use the airport name as a proxy for good weather and fail to predict delays when poor weather conditions occurred in those airports that had not experienced poor weather in the training data.\n\nTo address this challenge, I employed a two-stage modeling approach that I learned from the insurance industry. Here's what I did for the GE Flight Quest:\n\n1. Initially, I trained my model using features related to adverse weather and traffic conditions, which I intuitively believed had a strong causal relationship with flight delays.\n2. Then, I trained a second model to capture the residual effects specific to each airport.\n\nThis two-stage approach can be compared to boosting. The prediction of the first model serves as an offset for the second model. The key difference is that the choice of features is not random; you start with features you trust.\n\nI see this approach as a good candidate to reduce potential model bias. The strategy would be as follows:\n\n1. Train a first model using features that you have high confidence in and trust, and that you intuitively see a causal relationship with the target variable.\n2. Train a second model using the predictions of the first model as an offset, while incorporating features in which you have less confidence.\n\nHave you employed similar two-stage modeling approaches to reduce bias? Can you recommend alternative modeling techniques to handle features with poor representation in the training data?\n\nGxav", "author_fullname": "t2_cvej3qatd", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Features that may have poor representation in the training data", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FeatureEng", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_147x9gj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1686602923.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.FeatureEng", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feature selection is a challenging task in machine learning, and while feature importance reports can be helpful, blindly trusting all features is not always recommended.
