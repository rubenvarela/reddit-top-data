The DE consultants are pushing different environments for development, testing and production while our analysts are drowning in reporting work and are not allowed to create their own tables and/or files.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "149xd8e", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "foldingtoiletpaper", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/149xd8e/am_i_wrong_here_tasked_with_data_modeling_using/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/149xd8e/am_i_wrong_here_tasked_with_data_modeling_using/", "subreddit_subscribers": 110554, "created_utc": 1686819604.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Due to all kinds of reasons like failure of collection sensors, communication error, and unexpected malfunction, missing values are common to see in time series from the real-world environment.

My team and I, an executive of the company, faced many issues that took too much time to solve. That got me thinking: how many other executives and team leads out there will have to struggle through the same issues, and how can I help them prepare? This is why I gathered some useful information that I believe could be useful for many people.\n\n  \nMergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) bring about significant shifts in operations and culture for employees and the impact of data-related challenges on these aspects is frequently overlooked. Ensure you or your company are not making the same mistake.\n\n  \nMergers and acquisitions often trigger substantial organizational uncertainty about what lies ahead: typically, the operational model and culture undergo significant transformations for one or both of the merging entities. These alterations extend beyond just a new name and executive leadership; first and foremost, M&amp;A change the way IT teams work. Anticipating and addressing these IT challenges can pave the way for smooth and efficient integration. Conversely, failure to foresee and manage these issues can result in poor business performance, attrition of key talent, and potential data breaches. In this article, experts from AINSYS delve into the IT complications that can emerge during and post M&amp;A, and provide tools for addressing them effectively.\n\n  \nDuring and after M&amp;A, two companies\u2019 tech stacks essentially collide, and IT management has to deal with a number of challenges:\n\n# 1. Integrating disparate systems and platforms\n\nIntegrating disparate systems and platforms is one of the most significant challenges during mergers and acquisitions. When two companies come together, they often bring with them different IT systems and platforms that have been tailored to their specific business processes and needs. These systems can range from customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, to data management platforms, financial systems, and more.  \nHere are some of the key issues that arise during this integration process:\n\n* Compatibility: the systems used by the merging companies may not be compatible. They may be built on different architectures, use different data formats, or be based on different technologies. This can make integration a complex and time-consuming process;\n* Data Consistency: each system may have its own way of storing and structuring data. Ensuring consistency in data definitions, formats, and structures across all systems is crucial to avoid confusion and errors in data analysis and decision-making;\n* Redundancy: there may be significant overlap in the functionality of the systems used by the two companies, leading to redundancy. Identifying and eliminating these redundancies is important to avoid unnecessary costs and complexity;\n* Security and Compliance: each system will have its own security measures and compliance requirements. Ensuring that the integrated system meets all necessary security standards and regulatory requirements is crucial;\n* User Training: Employees from each company will be familiar with their own systems, but may need training to use the new integrated system effectively;\n* System Performance: Integrating two systems can put a strain on the performance of the IT infrastructure. Ensuring the integrated system performs effectively without causing downtime or delays is important.\n\n2. Reconciling different data formats and standards\n\nWhen two companies merge, they bring with them different data systems that have been tailored to their specific needs and processes. These systems may use different data formats and adhere to different data standards, which can create several issues during integration, including data inconsistency, data loss (if one system uses a data format that the other system does not support, some data may be lost during the conversion process, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data in the integrated system), data quality (one system might allow for missing values in certain fields, while the other does not), and compliance issues.\n\n3. Significant differences in the technological maturity between the two companies\n\nIf one of the companies has a significant technological advantage over the other, several issues may arise:\n\n* Integration Complexity: if one company uses modern, cloud-based systems while the other still relies on legacy systems, integrating the two can be complex and time-consuming. It may require significant resources to upgrade or replace outdated systems;\n* Operational Disruptions: if one company\u2019s systems are automated and the other\u2019s are manual, it could disrupt business processes and workflows until the less advanced systems are upgraded;\n* Security Risks: Older, less advanced systems may have more vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of data breaches or cyberattacks. It\u2019s crucial to assess and address these risks as part of the integration process.\n\n4. Considering the human element\n\nThis is perhaps the most complex and difficult issue to solve, seeing as no specialist is alike and supporting employees through change in M&amp;A is the most important matter you will need to solve. Why is that? Well, the reason is that the success of any merger or acquisition is not just about integrating systems and processes, but also about bringing together people from different organizational cultures. Employees are the backbone of any organization, and their acceptance and adaptation to change can significantly impact the outcome of the M&amp;A.\n\n  \nThe problem is, employees are conservative and don\u2019t want to switch from systems they have been using for years, having to learn new skills to actually use them. Additionally, companies often have to hire additional employees or IT consultants in order to support them through the process.  \nAnd it is not like executives can allow their employees to take their sweet time to figure out a whole new way of doing things \u2013 they need to start profiting from the merger or acquisition as soon as possible.\n\n  \nMerging or acquiring companies must shift the day-to-day behavior and mind-sets of their employees to protect a deal\u2019s sources of value, both financial and organizational, and to make changes sustainable. Yet when McKinsey asked 3,199 leaders if they regarded the change programs at their own companies as successful, only one-third did.\n\n  \nIn fact, comprehensive change management strategies are vital in easing transitions during mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), as they help increase acceptance among employees and minimize potential disruption. Here\u2019s how these strategies can be applied:  \n\n\n* Implement Surveys for In-depth Understanding: confidential surveys can encourage employees to express concerns they might not voice in person. These surveys should be designed to address specific issues identified during the interviews, such as opportunities for promotion. The responses can provide a more detailed understanding of the company\u2019s situation;\n* Compile and Present a Detailed Report to Stakeholders: the findings from the interviews and surveys should be compiled into a comprehensive report. This report should highlight both the positive aspects and potential issues within the company, such as knowledge gaps or cultural problems. The report should be presented to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner;\n* Include Personalized Action Plans in the Report: the report should also contain personalized action plans for key tasks. This assigns responsibility and accountability, ensuring that important tasks are not overlooked. A well-implemented action plan can drive value-generating changes in the company;\n* Perform a Potential Resistance Analysis: a potential resistance analysis can identify potential obstacles within both organizations involved in the acquisition. This step should avoid creating a divisive \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality. Instead, it should focus on understanding employee concerns, perceived negatives of the deal, and their vision of their future roles in the company. This analysis can help drive the acquisition forward in a positive and inclusive manner.  \nOther issues can be solved via the right tool that addresses every issue mentioned.\n\n# How to effectively address data-related M&amp;A challenges?\n\nTo effectively address the challenges posed by M&amp;A, a comprehensive approach is required that addresses not only the technical aspects but also the human element. A no-code data sync and integration solution that serves as a central source of truth can be the key to this approach. This solution would transform data into a uniform format and securely store it in a single data warehouse, simplifying the integration process and ensuring data consistency and security.\n\n  \nA central source of truth (CSOT) is a concept in data management that refers to a single, authoritative source of data that everyone in the organization agrees is the real, trusted number. In the context of M&amp;A, a CSOT can help eliminate data inconsistencies and redundancies, streamline data management, and ensure all employees have access to the same, accurate data.\n\n  \nBy transforming all data into the same format, a CSOT can help to overcome the challenges of integrating disparate systems and reconciling different data formats and standards. No code aspect of the tool can significantly reduce the complexity and time required for data integration by involving business in the process. This ensures that all data is consistent and reliable.\n\n  \nMoreover, by storing all data securely in one data warehouse, a CSOT can help to maintain data privacy and security during and after the M&amp;A process. This can help to prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with all relevant regulations.\n\n# No-Code Data Solutions\n\nNo-code data solutions can play a crucial role in integrating two systems. These solutions allow users to manage and manipulate data without needing to write any code, making them accessible to both IT specialists and employees with no coding experience. This can help to speed up the integration process and enable companies to start profiting from M&amp;A right away.  \nFurthermore, by enabling non-technical employees to work with data, no-code solutions can help to address the human element of M&amp;A. They can get more employees on board with adopting new systems and for them to adapt to new workflows. This can help to reduce resistance to change and increase employee engagement and productivity.\n\nIn addition, no-code solutions can reduce the need to hire IT consultants or spend time figuring out the best IT architecture option. This can result in significant cost savings and allow companies to focus their resources on other aspects of the M&amp;A process.  \nThe rest of research can be found here:  https://ainsys.com/blog/2023/06/12/data-management-challenges-in-ma/?utm\\_source=linkedin&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_campaign=data\\_engineering&amp;utm\\_content=migrations\\_acquistions&amp;utm\\_term=ITarchitecture", "author_fullname": "t2_ct09rz3s", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Data management challenges in M&amp;A", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_149yxju", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Blog", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1686825092.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My company has recently gone through a merger. My team and I, an executive of the company, faced many issues that took too much time to solve. That got me thinking: how many other executives and team leads out there will have to struggle through the same issues, and how can I help them prepare? This is why I gathered some useful information that I believe could be useful for many people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A) bring about significant shifts in operations and culture for employees and the impact of data-related challenges on these aspects is frequently overlooked. Ensure you or your company are not making the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions often trigger substantial organizational uncertainty about what lies ahead: typically, the operational model and culture undergo significant transformations for one or both of the merging entities. These alterations extend beyond just a new name and executive leadership; first and foremost, M&amp;amp;A change the way IT teams work. Anticipating and addressing these IT challenges can pave the way for smooth and efficient integration. Conversely, failure to foresee and manage these issues can result in poor business performance, attrition of key talent, and potential data breaches. In this article, experts from AINSYS delve into the IT complications that can emerge during and post M&amp;amp;A, and provide tools for addressing them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During and after M&amp;amp;A, two companies\u2019 tech stacks essentially collide, and IT management has to deal with a number of challenges:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1. Integrating disparate systems and platforms&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Integrating disparate systems and platforms is one of the most significant challenges during mergers and acquisitions. When two companies come together, they often bring with them different IT systems and platforms that have been tailored to their specific business processes and needs. These systems can range from customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, to data management platforms, financial systems, and more.&lt;br/&gt;\nHere are some of the key issues that arise during this integration process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Compatibility: the systems used by the merging companies may not be compatible. They may be built on different architectures, use different data formats, or be based on different technologies. This can make integration a complex and time-consuming process;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data Consistency: each system may have its own way of storing and structuring data. Ensuring consistency in data definitions, formats, and structures across all systems is crucial to avoid confusion and errors in data analysis and decision-making;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redundancy: there may be significant overlap in the functionality of the systems used by the two companies, leading to redundancy. Identifying and eliminating these redundancies is important to avoid unnecessary costs and complexity;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Security and Compliance: each system will have its own security measures and compliance requirements. Ensuring that the integrated system meets all necessary security standards and regulatory requirements is crucial;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;User Training: Employees from each company will be familiar with their own systems, but may need training to use the new integrated system effectively;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;System Performance: Integrating two systems can put a strain on the performance of the IT infrastructure. Ensuring the integrated system performs effectively without causing downtime or delays is important.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reconciling different data formats and standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When two companies merge, they bring with them different data systems that have been tailored to their specific needs and processes. These systems may use different data formats and adhere to different data standards, which can create several issues during integration, including data inconsistency, data loss (if one system uses a data format that the other system does not support, some data may be lost during the conversion process, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data in the integrated system), data quality (one system might allow for missing values in certain fields, while the other does not), and compliance issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Significant differences in the technological maturity between the two companies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If one of the companies has a significant technological advantage over the other, several issues may arise:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integration Complexity: if one company uses modern, cloud-based systems while the other still relies on legacy systems, integrating the two can be complex and time-consuming. It may require significant resources to upgrade or replace outdated systems;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operational Disruptions: if one company\u2019s systems are automated and the other\u2019s are manual, it could disrupt business processes and workflows until the less advanced systems are upgraded;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Security Risks: Older, less advanced systems may have more vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of data breaches or cyberattacks. It\u2019s crucial to assess and address these risks as part of the integration process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Considering the human element&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most complex and difficult issue to solve, seeing as no specialist is alike and supporting employees through change in M&amp;amp;A is the most important matter you will need to solve. Why is that? Well, the reason is that the success of any merger or acquisition is not just about integrating systems and processes, but also about bringing together people from different organizational cultures. Employees are the backbone of any organization, and their acceptance and adaptation to change can significantly impact the outcome of the M&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, employees are conservative and don\u2019t want to switch from systems they have been using for years, having to learn new skills to actually use them. Additionally, companies often have to hire additional employees or IT consultants in order to support them through the process.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd it is not like executives can allow their employees to take their sweet time to figure out a whole new way of doing things \u2013 they need to start profiting from the merger or acquisition as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Merging or acquiring companies must shift the day-to-day behavior and mind-sets of their employees to protect a deal\u2019s sources of value, both financial and organizational, and to make changes sustainable. Yet when McKinsey asked 3,199 leaders if they regarded the change programs at their own companies as successful, only one-third did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, comprehensive change management strategies are vital in easing transitions during mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;amp;As), as they help increase acceptance among employees and minimize potential disruption. Here\u2019s how these strategies can be applied:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement Surveys for In-depth Understanding: confidential surveys can encourage employees to express concerns they might not voice in person. These surveys should be designed to address specific issues identified during the interviews, such as opportunities for promotion. The responses can provide a more detailed understanding of the company\u2019s situation;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Compile and Present a Detailed Report to Stakeholders: the findings from the interviews and surveys should be compiled into a comprehensive report. This report should highlight both the positive aspects and potential issues within the company, such as knowledge gaps or cultural problems. The report should be presented to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Include Personalized Action Plans in the Report: the report should also contain personalized action plans for key tasks. This assigns responsibility and accountability, ensuring that important tasks are not overlooked. A well-implemented action plan can drive value-generating changes in the company;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Perform a Potential Resistance Analysis: a potential resistance analysis can identify potential obstacles within both organizations involved in the acquisition. This step should avoid creating a divisive \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality. Instead, it should focus on understanding employee concerns, perceived negatives of the deal, and their vision of their future roles in the company. This analysis can help drive the acquisition forward in a positive and inclusive manner.&lt;br/&gt;\nOther issues can be solved via the right tool that addresses every issue mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How to effectively address data-related M&amp;amp;A challenges?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To effectively address the challenges posed by M&amp;amp;A, a comprehensive approach is required that addresses not only the technical aspects but also the human element.

DEs,\n\nRecently, the French senate voted [a law to allow Facial Recognition in public](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/french-senate-votes-in-favor-of-public-facial-recognition-pilot), at scale, in real time. Leaving the ethic topic aside, I can't help but to think, there's no way the French government can pull that off.  Technically, first, this would require a huge team of great engineers (how can they attract talents with the salary they offer), but also from a budget perspective. Running this in the Cloud, will cost a lot?\n\nI work for a GAFAM, and some of our data pipelines process around 0.5 to 0.7 TB/s. We have a few of these and they're not easy. As a small team - not all of our stuff is efficient  - and the only reason we're able to pull this off is because we pay millions of dollars in AWS bill per month.\n\nHow can the French government (known for its shit tech) can go about architecting a real-time facial recognition system at Country scale? Is this bill just marketing and the reality is they'll fail to deliver?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts as Data Engineer? Here are some over-simplified calculations:\n\n* So, there are 1.6M CCTV cameras in France, assuming all of them will stream into the system. Let's assume: resolution (2MP), average 15 FPS, H.264, 2MBs bitrate, that's at least **3 MB/s throughput per camera**, or a **total of 4.8 TB/s** for all cameras.\n* Assuming all 1.6 millions cameras stream 24 hours/day, it is **38.4M hours of stream p/day** (or, **663 PB/day).** To give an idea of the scale, that is **19x more hours of stream than Twitch** yesterday (according to twitchtracker).\n* Now suppose they use AWS Rekognition (which they won't) for inference and face matching. Price is $0.10 per minute of video (it's actually way more because you need multiple API calls and tons of application code around it, but it doesn't matter), that is: 38.4M hours\\*60 minutes\\*$0.10\\*24h, **$5 billion dollar per day** (ie, the full 2023 French Intelligence Budget, **in a singe day**). Even with massive discounts, there's just no way. Even with crazy optimisations, dividing this by 10, 20, 30, this would still be way too much given their annual budget.\n* Also, there's no way on earth they can fit that load in any Kinesis region.\n* Let's not even speak about them purchasing their own GPU mega-clusters, instead of using the Cloud.\n\nNow surely, there are better ways of designing and architecting this. But even then, it doesn't add up. I don't understand. They don't have enough employees, their engineers are not as good, they're under-paid, they don't have the infrastructure.\n\nTwo options: either, French people are told to be scared of Big Brother, when the reality is the French government is far far from being able to pull this off.\n\nOr, I am completely wrong, and there are better ways to design this for a fraction of the cost.

I come from a completely non-technical background, and while I have experience with the SDLC from working as part of a product team in my previous role, I am a total novice when it comes to data and analytics, let alone data engineering. I am also quite shy and have a chronic anxiety problem, which, suffice to say, doesn't help with being a functioning corporate employee (it took me four years to feel at ease in my previous role, speak up in meetings, etc.).\n\n\nGoing back to the job itself -- things were pretty different than what I expected. First of all, the team I joined was not aware that I was actually going to join (I had interviewed with various managers, and the point of the interview was to decide under whom to place these people from the bootcamp), which accounted for a pretty crappy first day. As a consequence, nobody approached me, and I, only having one other experience prior to that one, was not aware I was supposed to schedule intro meetings with the various people in the team to understand their role and what they were working on. I guess I was expecting a more proactive approach from their side. My manager was also out of office, at the time, which didn't help. It took me a while to start interacting with my coworkers; I had a mentor appointed, but this person, while being great at their job and very patient, did not have a plan on how to onboard a junior out of a bootcamp, and most of our interactions consisted of me asking what I could learn/do. \n\n\nA few months in, I am finally able to get a (limited) understanding of the project we're working on, I was able to contribute a little bit (some bug fixing), but I often find myself sitting there with nothing to do and asking the other engineers how I can support, reading documentation in the meantime. I don't get involved much in their discussions, they don't invite me to calls, mostly because they're limited in capacity, and when bugs come up, it's quicker for them to solve them without having to go through things step by step with me.
