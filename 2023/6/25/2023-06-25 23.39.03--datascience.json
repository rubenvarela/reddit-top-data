In this article, we'll embark on a journey to demystify vector databases, unravelling the fundamental concepts, applications, and their indispensable role in supporting and harnessing the potential of cutting-edge AI models.\n\nIn the world of AI, large language models heavily rely on vector embeddings, which are representations of data that carry semantic information. These embeddings have numerous attributes or features, making them complex to manage. In simple terms, the process of converting raw data into vectors is crucial to preserve information and relationships. To achieve this, we employ an embedding model that takes the raw data as input and generates vector embeddings. By passing the raw data through the embedding model, we ensure that the resulting vector embeddings retain significant information and capture the underlying relationships present in the data. This conversion enables efficient processing, analysis, and comparisons of the data in a more compact and meaningful vector representation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vector Embedding Process](https://preview.redd.it/5hufgl68z38b1.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c4c920aa7df454571a369d61481305f346295e1)\n\nTraditional databases struggle to handle the scale and complexity of this data, hindering real-time analysis and insights. That's where vector databases come in.\n\nVector databases are designed specifically to handle vector embeddings, offering performance, scalability, and flexibility. They enable advanced features like semantic information retrieval and long-term memory for AI models. Here's how they work:\n\n1. Generating Embeddings: An embedding model creates vector embeddings for the content we want to index, capturing essential patterns and relationships.\n2. Inserting into the Database: The vector embeddings are inserted into the vector database, along with references to the original content they were created from.\n3. Querying the Database: When an application issues a query, the same embedding model generates embeddings for the query. These query embeddings are used to search the vector database for similar vector embeddings.\n4. Retrieving Associated Content: The vector database returns similar embeddings along with the associated original content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vector Database Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/8eex0vfcz38b1.png?width=1399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2f82f2e9fde4705b747bf8e63f0ac3cc6a362f1e)\n\n**How does a vector database work?**\n\nUnlike traditional databases that match exact values, vector databases use similarity metrics to find the most similar vectors to a query. They employ algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, optimizing search through techniques like hashing, quantization, or graph-based search.\n\nA typical vector database pipeline includes:\n\n1. Indexing: Vectors are indexed using algorithms like PQ, LSH, or HNSW, mapping them to a data structure for faster searching.\n2. Querying: The vector database compares the indexed query vector with the indexed vectors in the dataset to find the nearest neighbours based on similarity.\n3. Post Processing: In some cases, the vector database retrieves the nearest neighbours from the dataset and applies additional processing, such as re-ranking using a different similarity measure, to provide the final results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vector Database Pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/9lbwserez38b1.png?width=1307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a32cf9e6fafdfb6ecb4b8544ca989b13d171224)\n\nBy employing these techniques, vector databases offer fast and accurate retrieval, striking a balance between speed and accuracy.\n\nIn summary, vector databases are tailored for managing vector embeddings, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of complex AI data.

In this org, we are split into 3 parts: 1) Data Engineering, 2) Data Science, and 3) Business Analytics&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data Engineering builds the data pipelines, ETLs, and manages the data warehouse. Data Science works on very specific projects like recommender, search, and customer churn models.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Business Analytics is like the business jobs that are also technical. Their job can be dashboarding, executive reporting, strategy insights, market analytics, etc. but they have to know a lot of SQL and some programming in order to extract the data and transform it into insights. They also need to know business context. It\u2019s like 50% coding and 50% making financial models and/or PowerPoint decks for execs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we interview people, especially interns and younger candidates, nobody wants to do BA. Everyone wants to do DS. The ironic thing is the DS jobs are the fewest in quantity and they only hire the most qualified people (usually people with PhDs). All the DE people have backgrounds in CS and the BA people have backgrounds like people on this sub where they usually have a MS in DS or Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just seems like the BA jobs are off putting to many candidates. As soon as I mention PowerPoint or excel, I can feel their souls die lol. The truth is it\u2019s part of the job, but there\u2019s more to it than that. I code a lot, I grab data from APIs, I go through developer docs, but yes, I also build decks and am good at it. I think there\u2019s more jobs in this sector and more upside for promotions and job opportunities. So why do people frown on BA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14ivufl", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dontlookmeupplease", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 53, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14ivufl/why_is_there_no_interest_in_business_analytics/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14ivufl/why_is_there_no_interest_in_business_analytics/", "subreddit_subscribers": 931223, "created_utc": 1687723662.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "TLDR: What is everyone pivoting to?

The company would only pay for 2 classes a year so I took it slow, another big mistake. \ud83d\ude2c The pandemic, and some other life things meant that I left my job and took a long time to graduate.

I've tried with Seaborn using:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    sns.catplot(\n        data=df_plot, \n        x=\"fold\", \n        y=\"value\",\n        hue=\"est__estimator\",\n        col=\"score\",\n        # hue=\"score\",\n        # hue=df_plot[['est__estimator', 'score']].apply(tuple, axis=1), \n        orient=\"v\", \n        # inner=\"box\",\n        # split=True,\n        kind=\"box\",\n        # sharey=True\n        )\n\nBut I don't really like how it makes two plots in a grid.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eyww86a8s58b1.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e9f62f77fc67b92817d1267644e159ef93cabbd7\n\nWhat I want to do is to have only one plot. Each different Estimator with a distinct color and test and train scores side by side. Maybe using some Hatches to show difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice?
