I&amp;#39;d like it all in one place but I&amp;#39;m not made of money so around $300-400 is my limit unless someone can offer a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just hate having that stack of 20 500Gb HDD&amp;#39;s just sitting there.(all backed up 1-1, so it&amp;#39;s more like 10) I feel like they&amp;#39;re waiting to be knocked over or for a static touch to end them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking two 14Tb drives in raid 1 for the majority. Not sure how to do so since I lack any more sata ports currently&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you my dudes! If you have any better ideas, please let me know! I&amp;#39;d appreciate it greatly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "1478lng", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "robert812003", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/1478lng/need_help_finding_best_solution_or_cost_per_tb/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1478lng/need_help_finding_best_solution_or_cost_per_tb/", "subreddit_subscribers": 687728, "created_utc": 1686525437.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
