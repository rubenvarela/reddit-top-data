I don't mean to say that these tasks aren't invaluable, they're super important for businesses on a tactical and strategic level + they help grow data maturity *but* I think there's so much more that can be done.\n\nA quick example, I was inbetween research positions last year for a few months and I had a brief stint in manufacturing. Their (mechanical) engineering processes were cutting-edge but everything data was a bit underwhelming. My job was to help them with that, I essentially did all of the lower hanging fruit: a robust data pipeline with basic dashboards.\n\nAfter you have that done there's just so much more to be done that has a higher ROI than doing more of the same. In their case:\n\n* Modelling failures per 1000 as a function of the chosen production steps and material (a lot of products they made were experimental).\n* Using computer vision to reject parts *before* they go to QA so you reduce their workload in checking clearly faulty parts\n* Predictive maintenance on certain machines would've been easy\n* Scheduling and operations research\n* ...\n\nWhat most of these things have in common is that they're using data to automate operational tasks. They also require a ton more maturity/engineering time because you need models that \"live\", get retrained, get monitored and more.\n\nA lot of this stuff didn't go through partially because their data team could not maintain it and imo building things and leaving them hanging is irresponsible. What is true is that imo is that many of these have a higher return (based on back of napkin calculations) than defining yet more KPI's and yet more bar charts.

I don&amp;#39;t mean to say that these tasks aren&amp;#39;t invaluable, they&amp;#39;re super important for businesses on a tactical and strategic level + they help grow data maturity &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; I think there&amp;#39;s so much more that can be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quick example, I was inbetween research positions last year for a few months and I had a brief stint in manufacturing. Their (mechanical) engineering processes were cutting-edge but everything data was a bit underwhelming. My job was to help them with that, I essentially did all of the lower hanging fruit: a robust data pipeline with basic dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you have that done there&amp;#39;s just so much more to be done that has a higher ROI than doing more of the same. In their case:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Modelling failures per 1000 as a function of the chosen production steps and material (a lot of products they made were experimental).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using computer vision to reject parts &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they go to QA so you reduce their workload in checking clearly faulty parts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Predictive maintenance on certain machines would&amp;#39;ve been easy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scheduling and operations research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What most of these things have in common is that they&amp;#39;re using data to automate operational tasks.

Although I've been preparing meticulously, using methods like the STAR technique to structure my answers, I've been consistently receiving feedback that my responses lack clarity and a customer-focused orientation.\n\nI find this feedback quite confusing. In a behavioral interview question, there are often multiple valid approaches to resolving a given situation. However, I'm beginning to feel as though the interviewer is expecting a particular answer, one that aligns with their own preconceived notion of the \"right\" response. Perhaps I have been getting rejected not because my answers are wrong, but because they do not align with what the interviewer has in mind.\n\nThis has left me feeling a bit lost. My primary aim in these interviews is to demonstrate my problem-solving capabilities, flexibility, and commitment to the role.
