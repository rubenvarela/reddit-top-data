The professor had worked in Data Science and often told us about his experience. He always brought real world examples into his teaching. Not long after, I quickly double majored in Data Analytics. My school had a great program in the field and was one of the first to offer it as a major. In fact, just a year ago, they created a state-of-the-art analytics lab to complement our Bloomberg lab (with real Bloomberg terminals). I learned a ton, and I was entrenched in the field fully. \n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t have a CS background, I had a ton of knowledge in stats, so I immediately enjoyed the classes that got into ML models. Furthermore, I learned a ton about data architecture and it\u2019s been very useful in my professional career thus far. \n\nI graduated in 2020 and was ready to get into the industry. Not long after, COVID started and job prospects went out the window. It took several months, but in September of 2020 I landed my first job after graduating as a Technical Operations Analyst. It wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted, but work was hard to come by. I had to take a few Operations Research courses in my undergrad, so I had a decent foundation. The role didn\u2019t involve much, but I did implement an ERP system for the company. In January of 2021 (ironically on my birthday), the company went out of business and unfortunately I was searching for work once again. \n\nI sent out hundreds of applications, and ended up landing my current job as a \u201cData Migration Analyst\u201d. I essentially manage databases, write custom queries and work with Azure. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no analytics involved, but it pays well and I enjoy it. However, I never lost my desire to get into the Data Science field.\n\nI have a lot of downtime with my job, so I decided to start my Master of Science in Data Science. It\u2019s been great thus far, and I\u2019ll be graduating this fall. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s not complete yet, I\u2019ve been applying to jobs in the field. Whether it\u2019s data engineer/scientist/analyst, BI analyst/developer etc, I\u2019m getting almost no traction. I\u2019ve applied to 100+ jobs. \n\nI have a portfolio with 3 projects:\n\n1. Used Python to clean/manipulate NFL data and create an interactive dashboard that assigns a rookie prospect grade based on college performance &amp; combine athletic metrics. \n\n2. Performed a clustering analysis using R on credit card data. I then analyzed a specific cluster that displayed poor credit behaviours using excel. \n\n3. Created a visually-appealing Power BI dashboard for US Super Market sales. The first dashboard displays all of the relevant metrics, the second forecasts sales for X amount of days in advance. I also used DAX/power query. \n\n\nThe only traction I\u2019ve gotten since December:\n\n- had interviews in the winter for a Jr. Cloud Engineering role but unfortunately fell short after 4 rounds of interviews.  \n- had a headhunter reach out for a contract Data Analyst role, but I said I needed 2 weeks notice and they needed an immediate start\n- had an offer for a Middle Database Developer role, but the money was horrendous, so I just couldn\u2019t justify the pay cut \n\nI know the market is bad, but is there something I\u2019m doing wrong or could change here? I think my resume is perfected, everything down to metrics of improvement are on there.

The professor had worked in Data Science and often told us about his experience. He always brought real world examples into his teaching. Not long after, I quickly double majored in Data Analytics. My school had a great program in the field and was one of the first to offer it as a major. In fact, just a year ago, they created a state-of-the-art analytics lab to complement our Bloomberg lab (with real Bloomberg terminals). I learned a ton, and I was entrenched in the field fully. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I didn\u2019t have a CS background, I had a ton of knowledge in stats, so I immediately enjoyed the classes that got into ML models. Furthermore, I learned a ton about data architecture and it\u2019s been very useful in my professional career thus far. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I graduated in 2020 and was ready to get into the industry. Not long after, COVID started and job prospects went out the window. It took several months, but in September of 2020 I landed my first job after graduating as a Technical Operations Analyst. It wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted, but work was hard to come by. I had to take a few Operations Research courses in my undergrad, so I had a decent foundation. The role didn\u2019t involve much, but I did implement an ERP system for the company. In January of 2021 (ironically on my birthday), the company went out of business and unfortunately I was searching for work once again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sent out hundreds of applications, and ended up landing my current job as a \u201cData Migration Analyst\u201d. I essentially manage databases, write custom queries and work with Azure. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no analytics involved, but it pays well and I enjoy it. However, I never lost my desire to get into the Data Science field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of downtime with my job, so I decided to start my Master of Science in Data Science. It\u2019s been great thus far, and I\u2019ll be graduating this fall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it\u2019s not complete yet, I\u2019ve been applying to jobs in the field. Whether it\u2019s data engineer/scientist/analyst, BI analyst/developer etc, I\u2019m getting almost no traction. I\u2019ve applied to 100+ jobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a portfolio with 3 projects:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used Python to clean/manipulate NFL data and create an interactive dashboard that assigns a rookie prospect grade based on college performance &amp;amp; combine athletic metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performed a clustering analysis using R on credit card data. I then analyzed a specific cluster that displayed poor credit behaviours using excel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created a visually-appealing Power BI dashboard for US Super Market sales. The first dashboard displays all of the relevant metrics, the second forecasts sales for X amount of days in advance. I also used DAX/power query. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only traction I\u2019ve gotten since December:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;had interviews in the winter for a Jr. Cloud Engineering role but unfortunately fell short after 4 rounds of interviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;had a headhunter reach out for a contract Data Analyst role, but I said I needed 2 weeks notice and they needed an immediate start&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;had an offer for a Middle Database Developer role, but the money was horrendous, so I just couldn\u2019t justify the pay cut &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the market is bad, but is there something I\u2019m doing wrong or could change here? I think my resume is perfected, everything down to metrics of improvement are on there. For example, I contributed to a 300% increase in firms onboarded per-month at my current role. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would you do differently? It\u2019s hard being 26 years old and feeling like the chances of getting into the industry are fading with every day I don\u2019t apply everything I\u2019ve learned in a work
