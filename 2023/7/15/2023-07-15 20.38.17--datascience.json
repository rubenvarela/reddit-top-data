If so, how?\") and while reading the FAQ's and weekly threads, I noticed there is not a lot of posts related to non-STEM background transitioning to Data Analysis, hence this is my attempt to help anyone out there.\n\n**Background / Context**\n\nI studied my undergrad degree in Mexico City (my hometown) in Finance and Banking. It was mostly focused in trading (debt and equity) and corporate finance (budgetting, ledgers, basics of forecasting, entrepreneurship). Since year 1, I also worked as an intern for a private bank, so I always had my days pretty packed with homehork, classes and things to do at work. \n\nAfter graduation, I was still in the same company but now with a full-time job as a financial \"analyst\" , where my analysis weren't further than creating Excel Sheets with some graphs, until I eventually got involved into learning VBA and programming macros, and this is where I found out I loved stuff related to coding. \n\nUp to this point I was still working in the company but now helping all the teams to automate all of their processes through VBA and even some Python (I used to search on my own all of this, mostly on YouTube or StackOverflow). I still didn't have any idea on what actual data analysis was, I was just enjoying the process of learning new skills. \n\n**The transition to Data Analysis**\n\nAfter approximately 1.5 years of doing VBA and automation, I felt stuck and not learning anyomre. The company I worked for is very small, around 100 employes, so there was no clear organizational structure to grow, I had no mentors or anything like it. \n\nHere is where I found this [Data Analytics BootCamp](https://bootcamp.tec.mx/data/) in one of the best private universities in the country. I managed some stuff at work and convinced my boss to pay for the whole thing, as the BootCamp itself was a bit expensive (around 6k USD) and I couldn't afford it myself out of the blue. \n\nI am no related to the school at all other than being their former student on this Bootcamp, so everything I am going to say is pure personal experience, but you can also check [what other people say about it](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tecnologico-de-monterrey-boot-camps).\n\nThe program was very intense, it lasted for 9 months and I had at least 6 hours of studying per week (after working hours). The program is fast-paced, and is made for you to actually study most of the time rather than just keeping what you saw in class. The teacher shows you the basics, answers questions and shows a couple of examples, but gives a lot of resources where you can expand your knowledge based on the topics you saw. \n\nAfter finishing, I couldn't believe that I was able to set up a basic HTML webpage online, containing Python code in the backend that would execute some analysis after clicking a button on the frontend. This was our final project (unfortunately Heroku changed its pricing plan so the page is no longer up, otherwise I would share it), and I was so proud of how much I learned using Python, SQL, HTML and JavaScript (and a few libraries from it). \n\nAfter finishing, you also get career coaching to improve your CV and LinkedIn profile to adapt to today's recruitment world, which oh boy, only if I knew. I learned about the automated systems that review CV's, what kind of elements you should include and exclude from a CV, what experience is actually relevant, what should you add as skills or activities in your previous jobs, and much more. \n\nAnd finally after 3 months of finishing the bootcamp, I was landing my first job as a Data Analyst in [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/). As a small reminder from the title, **this happened after 7 full years of working experience.**\n\n**What happened after becoming a Data Analyst**\n\nI was super happy with my new job, everything was new for me, I was learning tons and already delivering good results after 3-4 months of being at my new job. Little that I knew, I was sourced on LinkedIn from a recruiter in the other side of the world and being offered full relocation package to work for Bolt, the so-called \"Uber EU competitor\". One of my life goals was to live abroad, so after a long 5 months of process, I was ready to relocate to Estonia. \n\nNow, after 1.5 years, I have been promoted to Senior Data Analyst and I'm still learning and enjoy as much as when I first did data analysis. Of course, we all want to keep growing and improving, so I just keep doing so and from time to time trying to get more involved into Data Science, so hopefully one day I can make another post of \"non-STEM background transitioned to Data Science\". \n\n**What skills do I actually use as a Data Analyst?** \n\nI think most of us are stuck in a never-ending world filled with as many resources as possible and we are often told \"you need to learn X, Y and Z skills\" while others say \"you actually need A, B and C\". While there is no aboslute truth, I will tell you what skills I use everyday since I started this journey:\n\n\\- Logical thinking. This is perhaps one of the most underrated skills, as I don't see many people talking about it. The fact that you need to understand how coding works in a logical level it's so crucial but everyone gives it for granted. You should be able to know what are logical operators, what is a function and its parameters and how do they work, what is the logic behind a LOOP, an IF and how to gather everything together. This goes beyond any programming language, you can always ask ChatGPT nowadays how to write an IF statement in JS, Python, R, SQL, etc. But **when** and **how** to apply  it is the most important part. \n\n\\- SQL. This is by far top 1 language I needed to learn. Even before Python (which comes next), SQL is a very basic tool everyone aspiring to be a Data Analyst should have. Even if you don't know Python, you can even read tables using SQL through Python, and not the other way around. You should know how to select columns, transform them, create new ones, group them, do Window functions, Ranking functions, and more. \n\n\\- Python. I don't know how many companies out there don't use Python, but I would say it's a pretty standard language to learn nowadays, specially because its structure is not so complicated to learn. I've seen already a good description on the basic libraries you should know about Python [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/wiki/frequently-asked-questions/#wiki_how_do_i_learn%2E%2E%2E), so I won't repeat much about it. \n\n\\- Statistics. If you want to analyze data, you need to know at least basic statistics to help you through the day. You should be able to know basic concepts such as trends, medians, means, basic regression, interquartiles, discrete variables, and so on. I am maybe not the best guide in this field as I have not that much knowledge on it and what I know is more from my previous experience rather than formal education, so maybe I'm saying some stuff that it's not basic.   \nThe whole point is that you should be able somehow to identify the trends and spot problems, opportunities within the data you analyze. Most of the times the managers and other higher management won't care if you did a super exotic model or a very basic comparison, they care for the value you can bring. \n\n\\- BI Tool. I personally use Looker, but it really doesn't matter if you use Power BI, Tableau or I don't know which others exist out there. The full point is to understand how BI tools work, what are dimensions and measures and which ones are grouped by to get proper results. You should know also what is the purpose of each graph and adapt it accordingly to your needs.\n\n\\- Communication skills. This is also taken for granted in many cases but I have first-hand seen a lot of people that can't communicate their ideas clearly. They are great at finding insights or coding, but they can't just translate their technical thoughts to good business opportunities, thus upper management folks just disregard ideas or don't understand clearly and don't push their ideas to a proper place. \n\nI think these are the top 5 skills I can tell you are constantly used in my every day life. Some others that I also use constantly but were not the basis for getting a job here are: \n\n\\-Github or any other version control software (I would say this is a VERY important tool to have and every tech-related person should know it, but it was not relevant in any of my interview process so not highlighting it)   \n\\- dbt  \n\\- Databricks (SparkSQL)  \n\\- Relational vs no Relational Databases  \n\\- Jupyter Notebooks (Mostly related to Python learning, so kinda assumed you know how to use them after learning Python)  \n\n\n**Summary / Conclusions**\n\nIf you feel more confused than you were after reading all of this (thank you for reading btw), I will try to summarise the most important points: \n\n1. If you don't have any good background in math or statistcs nor programming, I would encourage you to at least study some kind of bootcamp or specialization in Data Analysis, where Python, SQL, Statistics and a Power BI tool are taught. If you are a self-learner that is also a good way, however, unfortunately some companies prefer solid studies backgrounds (which I don't agree with), so we also need to think how the real world is moving. \n2. This is a long path. You don't have to work 7 years like I did to start thinking about studying something, as everyone's path is different. But those years definitely helped me to develop some skills such as knowing your stakeholders, communicating clrearly and logical thinking. So I can tell you that it's highly likely you won't transition in one or 2 years, specially if you have no prior experience. Remember it's not a race, it's your professional path and what you will be doing for the rest of your life (if that's what you want of course), so better to take the needed steps to do it right and in the long term you will find better benefits. \n3. One thing I didn't mention in the Bootcamp part is that you should aim to have a Github portfolio showcasing some of your projects. There are many resources like [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) that can help you work in projects and upload them to Github. These projects will help you not only to practice your skills and take them to then next level, but will also be a complimentary tool in your job-search. \n\nFinally, if you have any questions or feel like I could improve the information in my post, let me know and I'll try my best to answer or update this. \n\nAnd for everyone out there trying to get to this field, best of success!", "author_fullname": "t2_bkj30odx", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How I transitioned from Accounting / Finance to Data Analytics after 7 years of work.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1509qjo", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1689420916.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I don&amp;#39;t know how long this post will be but for sure I know it will be a long one.&lt;br/&gt;\nI just want to say that, as many of you around this sub, I am also looking for personal growth and wondering stuff (currently it is &amp;quot;should I transition to Data Science?

I managed some stuff at work and convinced my boss to pay for the whole thing, as the BootCamp itself was a bit expensive (around 6k USD) and I couldn&amp;#39;t afford it myself out of the blue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am no related to the school at all other than being their former student on this Bootcamp, so everything I am going to say is pure personal experience, but you can also check &lt;a href=\"https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tecnologico-de-monterrey-boot-camps\"&gt;what other people say about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The program was very intense, it lasted for 9 months and I had at least 6 hours of studying per week (after working hours). The program is fast-paced, and is made for you to actually study most of the time rather than just keeping what you saw in class. The teacher shows you the basics, answers questions and shows a couple of examples, but gives a lot of resources where you can expand your knowledge based on the topics you saw. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After finishing, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe that I was able to set up a basic HTML webpage online, containing Python code in the backend that would execute some analysis after clicking a button on the frontend. This was our final project (unfortunately Heroku changed its pricing plan so the page is no longer up, otherwise I would share it), and I was so proud of how much I learned using Python, SQL, HTML and JavaScript (and a few libraries from it). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After finishing, you also get career coaching to improve your CV and LinkedIn profile to adapt to today&amp;#39;s recruitment world, which oh boy, only if I knew. I learned about the automated systems that review CV&amp;#39;s, what kind of elements you should include and exclude from a CV, what experience is actually relevant, what should you add as skills or activities in your previous jobs, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally after 3 months of finishing the bootcamp, I was landing my first job as a Data Analyst in &lt;a href=\"https://nubank.com.br/en/\"&gt;Nubank&lt;/a&gt;. As a small reminder from the title, &lt;strong&gt;this happened after 7 full years of working experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened after becoming a Data Analyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was super happy with my new job, everything was new for me, I was learning tons and already delivering good results after 3-4 months of being at my new job. Little that I knew, I was sourced on LinkedIn from a recruiter in the other side of the world and being offered full relocation package to work for Bolt, the so-called &amp;quot;Uber EU competitor&amp;quot;. One of my life goals was to live abroad, so after a long 5 months of process, I was ready to relocate to Estonia. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, after 1.5 years, I have been promoted to Senior Data Analyst and I&amp;#39;m still learning and enjoy as much as when I first did data analysis. Of course, we all want to keep growing and improving, so I just keep doing so and from time to time trying to get more involved into Data Science, so hopefully one day I can make another post of &amp;quot;non-STEM background transitioned to Data Science&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skills do I actually use as a Data Analyst?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think most of us are stuck in a never-ending world filled with as many resources as possible and we are often told &amp;quot;you need to learn X, Y and Z skills&amp;quot; while others say &amp;quot;you actually need A, B and C&amp;quot;. While there is no aboslute truth, I will tell you what skills I use everyday since I started this journey:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Logical thinking. This is perhaps one of the most underrated skills, as I don&amp;#39;t see many people talking about it. The fact that you need to understand how coding works in a logical level it&amp;#39;s so crucial but everyone gives it for granted. You should be able to know what are logical operators, what is a function and its parameters and how do they work, what is the logic behind a LOOP, an IF and how to gather everything together. This goes beyond any programming language, you can always ask ChatGPT nowadays how to write an IF statement in JS, Python, R, SQL, etc. But &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to apply  it is the most important part. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- SQL. This is by far top 1 language I needed to learn. Even before Python (which comes next), SQL is a very basic tool everyone aspiring to be a Data Analyst should have. Even if you don&amp;#39;t know Python, you can even read tables using SQL through Python, and not the other way around. You should know how to select columns, transform them, create new ones, group them, do Window functions, Ranking functions, and more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Python. I don&amp;#39;t know how many companies out there don&amp;#39;t use Python, but I would say it&amp;#39;s a pretty standard language to learn nowadays, specially because its structure is not so complicated to learn. I&amp;#39;ve seen already a good description on the basic libraries you should know about Python &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/wiki/frequently-asked-questions/#wiki_how_do_i_learn%2E%2E%2E\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so I won&amp;#39;t repeat much about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Statistics. If you want to analyze data, you need to know at least basic statistics to help you through the day. You should be able to know basic concepts such as trends, medians, means, basic regression, interquartiles, discrete variables, and so on. I am maybe not the best guide in this field as I have not that much knowledge on it and what I know is more from my previous experience rather than formal education, so maybe I&amp;#39;m saying some stuff that it&amp;#39;s not basic.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe whole point is that you should be able somehow to identify the trends and spot problems, opportunities within the data you analyze. Most of the times the managers and other higher management won&amp;#39;t care if you did a super exotic model or a very basic comparison, they care for the value you can bring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- BI Tool. I personally use Looker, but it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you use Power BI, Tableau or I don&amp;#39;t know which others exist out there. The full point is to understand how BI tools work, what are dimensions and measures and which ones are grouped by to get proper results. You should know also what is the purpose of each graph and adapt it accordingly to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Communication skills. This is also taken for granted in many cases but I have first-hand seen a lot of people that can&amp;#39;t communicate their ideas clearly. They are great at finding insights or coding, but they can&amp;#39;t just translate their technical thoughts to good business opportunities, thus upper management folks just disregard ideas or don&amp;#39;t understand clearly and don&amp;#39;t push their ideas to a proper place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think these are the top 5 skills I can tell you are constantly used in my every day life. Some others that I also use constantly but were not the basis for getting a job here are: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Github or any other version control software (I would say this is a VERY important tool to have and every tech-related person should know it, but it was not relevant in any of my interview process so not highlighting it)&lt;br/&gt;\n- dbt&lt;br/&gt;\n- Databricks (SparkSQL)&lt;br/&gt;\n- Relational vs no Relational Databases&lt;br/&gt;\n- Jupyter Notebooks (Mostly related to Python learning, so kinda assumed you know how to use them after learning Python)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary / Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel more confused than you were after reading all of this (thank you for reading btw), I will try to summarise the most important points: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have any good background in math or statistcs nor programming, I would encourage you to at least study some kind of bootcamp or specialization in Data Analysis, where Python, SQL, Statistics and a Power BI tool are taught. If you are a self-learner that is also a good way, however, unfortunately some companies prefer solid studies backgrounds (which I don&amp;#39;t agree with), so we also need to think how the real world is moving. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is a long path. You don&amp;#39;t have to work 7 years like I did to start thinking about studying something, as everyone&amp;#39;s path is different. But those years definitely helped me to develop some skills such as knowing your stakeholders, communicating clrearly and logical thinking. So I can tell you that it&amp;#39;s highly likely you won&amp;#39;t transition in one or 2 years, specially if you have no prior experience. Remember it&amp;#39;s not a race, it&amp;#39;s your professional path and what you will be doing for the rest of your life (if that&amp;#39;s what you want of course), so better to take the needed steps to do it right and in the long term you will find better benefits. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One thing I didn&amp;#39;t mention in the Bootcamp part is that you should aim to have a Github portfolio showcasing some of your projects. There are many resources like &lt;a href=\"https://freecodecamp.org\"&gt;freecodecamp.org&lt;/a&gt; that can help you work in projects and upload them to Github. These projects will help you not only to practice your skills and take them to then next level, but will also be a complimentary tool in your job-search. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you have any questions or feel like I could improve the information in my post, let me know and I&amp;#39;ll try my best to answer or update this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for everyone out there trying to get to this field, best of success!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1509qjo", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Casio04", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1509qjo/how_i_transitioned_from_accounting_finance_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1509qjo/how_i_transitioned_from_accounting_finance_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 949253, "created_utc": 1689420916.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI am planning to use XGBoost to fit spatio temporal dataset that I made into a column row format (rows have space-time samples with features in columns).\nMy goal isn\u2019t prediction, I just want a model fit that\u2019s generalizable enough after which I can use it to learn insights from my data.
