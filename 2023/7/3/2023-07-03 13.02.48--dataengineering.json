So I've this idea knocking around in my mind for a while, \"why not just write some dynamic SQL to look at the schema and then use that schema table to generate queries on each column to get some metrics?\"\n\nThis weekend, I decided to tackle this problem (no, I don't have any friends). So I wrote some scripts using plpgsql for postgres-based databases (postgres, redshift, oracle?) and snowflake that would solve this problem for me. \n\nFeel free to view the scripts here: [https://github.com/Touvjes/SQL-utilities](https://github.com/Touvjes/SQL-utilities)\n\nEssentially what these scripts do is 1) create a metadata table which includes one row per column in specified data table and 2) use variant-specific control flow structures to loop through the metadata table to execute queries using the schema+table name in each metadata table row to identify for each column: an example value, the total non-null count, the total distinct count, and the percent populated. \n\nNaturally, one could write such queries by hand, but its tedious if you're often being given dozens or hundreds of table and stakeholders ask \"can we do x,y,z analysis?\" and one has to go and figure it out why invariably, the data doesn't allow for such analysis.\n\n What these scripts allow you to do is take the input of either a single table (and in the future, a whole schema, or a whole database) and answer the questions: \n\n* what does the data look like in each column of each table? \n* how variable are each of those  columns (i.e. # distinct values) \n* how reliably is that data populated?\n\nOne might ask, can't we just connect to a database with python/java/c# and use an ACTUAL programming languages to generate the sql to generate the statistics and thereby preclude the necessity of using obscure, under-documented, borderline-masochistic sql-variant-specific scripting languages?  (Where's the challenge in that?)\n\nThe answer to that is Yes, unless the answer happens to be No. \n\nBy that I mean that in theory, you certainly can-- and to be fair, I'm sure there are a plethora of data analysis/data mining software solutions that solve this exact problem. However, in practice, especially when working with client data, such solutions are not always feasible. Therein lies the impetus for my endeavor to develop native solutions. \n\nNote that with the framework in place, it is fairly easy to follow the structure given in the scripts to add and include your own metrics if wanted. A word of fair warning though-- these scripts execute a query that generates a new query for each column, which in turn generates a query for each metric, most of which will result in a full table scan. Needless to say, this is FAR from optimized. \n\nComments, constructive criticism, and contributions are welcome. I will probably eventually  write equivalent scripts for Mysql and T-sql next time I do projects using those variants. Else, If someone thinks this is possible in purely vanilla ansi sql, feel free to knock my socks off with a demonstration of that.

So I&amp;#39;ve this idea knocking around in my mind for a while, &amp;quot;why not just write some dynamic SQL to look at the schema and then use that schema table to generate queries on each column to get some metrics?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I decided to tackle this problem (no, I don&amp;#39;t have any friends). So I wrote some scripts using plpgsql for postgres-based databases (postgres, redshift, oracle?) and snowflake that would solve this problem for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to view the scripts here: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/Touvjes/SQL-utilities\"&gt;https://github.com/Touvjes/SQL-utilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially what these scripts do is 1) create a metadata table which includes one row per column in specified data table and 2) use variant-specific control flow structures to loop through the metadata table to execute queries using the schema+table name in each metadata table row to identify for each column: an example value, the total non-null count, the total distinct count, and the percent populated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, one could write such queries by hand, but its tedious if you&amp;#39;re often being given dozens or hundreds of table and stakeholders ask &amp;quot;can we do x,y,z analysis?&amp;quot; and one has to go and figure it out why invariably, the data doesn&amp;#39;t allow for such analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What these scripts allow you to do is take the input of either a single table (and in the future, a whole schema, or a whole database) and answer the questions: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;what does the data look like in each column of each table? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how variable are each of those  columns (i.e. # distinct values) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how reliably is that data populated?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One might ask, can&amp;#39;t we just connect to a database with python/java/c# and use an ACTUAL programming languages to generate the sql to generate the statistics and thereby preclude the necessity of using obscure, under-documented, borderline-masochistic sql-variant-specific scripting languages?  (Where&amp;#39;s the challenge in that?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer to that is Yes, unless the answer happens to be No. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By that I mean that in theory, you certainly can-- and to be fair, I&amp;#39;m sure there are a plethora of data analysis/data mining software solutions that solve this exact problem. However, in practice, especially when working with client data, such solutions are not always feasible. Therein lies the impetus for my endeavor to develop native solutions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that with the framework in place, it is fairly easy to follow the structure given in the scripts to add and include your own metrics if wanted. A word of fair warning though-- these scripts execute a query that generates a new query for each column, which in turn generates a query for each metric, most of which will result in a full table scan. Needless to say, this is FAR from optimized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comments, constructive criticism, and contributions are welcome. I will probably eventually  write equivalent scripts for Mysql and T-sql next time I do projects using those variants.
