I want to move to something less client facing and more technical due to stress of consulting and it not matching my personality, I enjoy the technical side of my job most. Could data engineering be a fit?\n\nHi DE folks. I'm a few years into my career working with Microsoft Dynamics/Power Platform as a consultant and I'm starting to realize I don't want this to be my career long term. My bachelors is in Information Systems but I took 5 or 6 computer science courses in college as well (SQL, Java, data structures/algorithms). I'm trying to think of a possible career switch, something technical and not consulting/super client facing. I don't expect to land a job in my new career anytime soon as I would need to learn whatever it is I choose, so what I'm trying to decide is: what should I spend the next year or two learning so I can jump in when the time is right.\n\nMy initial thought was a developer position of some sort (maybe .net) as I already have some development experience at my job/from college and i enjoy writing code. However, after looking at the CSCareerQuestions subreddit it seems like the layoffs have made it near impossible for an entry level/mid level developer to get a job anytime soon.\n\nThings that are important in my decision are\n\n1. work from home, at least to some degree\n2. pay. this one is probably most important to me and i want a career where I can continue to level up and not take a big pay hit. I make low six-figures now.\n3. Not consulting or a ton of client facing. some is fine, but i don't want that to be a huge part of my job. stresses me out.\n4. Want to enter a career path that is growing fast and has some job security with the layoffs going on.\n5. I feel like I kind of pigeon-holed myself going into microsoft dynamics specifically. I don't want to do that again and i want to change career paths relatively soon so i don't continue to put myself in a corner.\n\nI have experience building/configuring/extending Power apps/Dynamics crm (mostly model-driven apps built on azure but some canvas apps as well, this is mostly low-code stuff), writing client-side form customizations in javascript, a little bit of backend plugin development in c#. I also have experience managing dev, test, prod environments and moving patches/solutions between them, and controlling access through AD security groups. I've done a small amount of data migration from sql dbs into dynamics, and integrating dynamics with other 3rd party systems via apis. Used Azure DevOps to manage our projects, and control licensing through Azure as well. Also pretty experienced with Power Automate and a little with PowerBI.\n\nWith this skillset and the above criteria, could Data Engineering be a good option for me? I like writing code and solving problems, learning new technologies and leveling up in my career.  How steep would the learning curve be for me having some experience with ETL migrations,integrations,SQL? What DE jobs are most in demand and what does the day-to-day look like? Is it mostly technical stuff or would I be getting back into consulting?\n\nIf this doesn't sound like the best fit, please recommend some other career paths!

I&amp;#39;m trying to think of a possible career switch, something technical and not consulting/super client facing. I don&amp;#39;t expect to land a job in my new career anytime soon as I would need to learn whatever it is I choose, so what I&amp;#39;m trying to decide is: what should I spend the next year or two learning so I can jump in when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My initial thought was a developer position of some sort (maybe .net) as I already have some development experience at my job/from college and i enjoy writing code. However, after looking at the CSCareerQuestions subreddit it seems like the layoffs have made it near impossible for an entry level/mid level developer to get a job anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things that are important in my decision are&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;work from home, at least to some degree&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;pay. this one is probably most important to me and i want a career where I can continue to level up and not take a big pay hit. I make low six-figures now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not consulting or a ton of client facing. some is fine, but i don&amp;#39;t want that to be a huge part of my job. stresses me out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Want to enter a career path that is growing fast and has some job security with the layoffs going on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I feel like I kind of pigeon-holed myself going into microsoft dynamics specifically. I don&amp;#39;t want to do that again and i want to change career paths relatively soon so i don&amp;#39;t continue to put myself in a corner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have experience building/configuring/extending Power apps/Dynamics crm (mostly model-driven apps built on azure but some canvas apps as well, this is mostly low-code stuff), writing client-side form customizations in javascript, a little bit of backend plugin development in c#. I also have experience managing dev, test, prod environments and moving patches/solutions between them, and controlling access through AD security groups. I&amp;#39;ve done a small amount of data migration from sql dbs into dynamics, and integrating dynamics with other 3rd party systems via apis. Used Azure DevOps to manage our projects, and control licensing through Azure as well. Also pretty experienced with Power Automate and a little with PowerBI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this skillset and the above criteria, could Data Engineering be a good option for me? I like writing code and solving problems, learning new technologies and leveling up in my career.  How steep would the learning curve be for me having some experience with ETL migrations,integrations,SQL? What DE jobs are most in demand and what does the day-to-day look like? Is it mostly technical stuff or would I be getting back into consulting?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this doesn&amp;#39;t sound like the best fit, please recommend some other career paths! Literally any feedback is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "069dd614-a7dc-11eb-8e48-0e90f49436a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "id": "14oelqv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jakeoy", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 20, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/14oelqv/thinking_about_a_possible_career_change/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/14oelqv/thinking_about_a_possible_career_change/", "subreddit_subscribers": 113647, "created_utc": 1688270988.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Hello, I'm a 24 years old with 2 years of data engineering experience in industry (banking, ads companies).
