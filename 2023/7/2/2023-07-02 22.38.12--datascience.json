But let's not forget the unsung heroes who wield SQL like a masterful sword, create dazzling visualizations, and extract meaningful insights from raw data.\n\nData analysts are the wizards behind the scenes, wielding their expertise to generate reports, craft informative dashboards, and provide actionable recommendations. In many organizations, they are the driving force behind data-informed decision-making, helping stakeholders understand complex datasets and uncover hidden patterns.\n\nThe truth is, while data science may offer a more sophisticated approach to analytics, the demand for such expertise often outstrips the appetite of many tech companies and start-ups. These organizations are laser-focused on rapid growth, and that's where the data analyst truly shines. Their ability to swiftly analyze and present data-driven insights is often the catalyst for making informed business decisions that accelerate growth.\n\nSo, if you find yourself struggling to break into the world of data science, I urge you to consider the realm of analytics. Not only can you still earn a handsome salary (think six figures, especially in product analytics), but it also opens up a natural pathway for future growth in data science.\n\nThe beauty of starting your journey as a data analyst lies in the breadth of opportunities it presents. You'll gain invaluable experience working closely with diverse datasets, honing your skills in data manipulation, visualization, and storytelling. Armed with this knowledge, you'll be well-equipped to transition seamlessly into data science when the time is right, bringing a unique perspective to the table.\n\nBy embracing analytics, you'll discover a world where you can make an immediate impact, influence key decisions, and drive meaningful change. Your expertise in translating raw data into actionable insights will be in high demand, and you'll be the go-to person for extracting value from vast amounts of information.\n\nSo, my fellow data aficionados, don't rule out the power of data analysis.

I&amp;#39;m also trying to find ways to get better at my current job so that I can be deemed worthy of a raise or promotion of some sort.

I knew since 2nd year of law school that this wasn't for me. Sadly, I only realized after a few internships and work experiences that being a lawyer was not something I wanted to do.\n\nSince then, I have decided to put off Masters studies (no point sinking more money into an LLM if I do not wish to be a lawyer or go into academia), and worked in AML/KYC in financial institutions to see how far I can get, since relevant work experience &gt; degree imo.\n\nI got the opportunity to work with SQL, Excel, and Tableau during my work, and started to become interested in analytics. I started to take online courses related to Data Science and found that I actually really enjoyed computational thinking, programming, and above all data analysis.\n\nThat being said, at my current position, the highest position I can reach is CCO. I also absolutely hate the monotony of regulatory compliance and the bureaucratic nature of dealing with CDD, on-going monitoring, validating signatures etc. I also crave the creativity and challenge that the job is just not bringing me. In fact, sometimes when I introduce a more creative and much more productive way to perform my task I get shot down by my manager and my department is full of tech-fearing boomers. It is a stable career, but due to management and other HR hurdles (the biggest caveat is my LLB in law - nothing remotely statistics or data science related there) it is difficult to get into a data science Masters or a more quantitative job where I can be challenged even more.\n\nRight now I am in a valuable position as I have been taking part time courses to fulfill entry requirements for STEM degrees, and can financially afford to study a 2nd bachelor's degree in BSc Data Science at a reputable engineering school in the EU (unlike data science courses which are basically business analytics packaged as data science in NA, this is essentially a stats course with CS, industrial connections are great at the uni too so career prospects are stellar) and opportunities to pursue masters studies in CS or Data Sci and AI or Cognitive Science so there is a lot of flexibility for the future.\n\nMy 2 options are:\n\n1. Continue on the path of KYC/AML, get ACAMS perhaps to get pay raise, progress to CCO, or look for opportunities to \"break\" into junior analyst positions and collect courses on the side. After around 6 years experience I could potentially apply to my local university's Masters in Info Tech (IT industry experience of x number of years and side courses can possibly make up for bachelors deficiency however i don't think KYC/AML is IT enough) and pivot into a junior role or a higher one if lucky.\n2. Take out 4-5 years studying a BSc + Masters (in the EU bachelors are 3 years long and masters typically 2 years but only 1 year in the UK), enjoy having more flexibility of options when it comes to paths I can choose (law is quite restricted in that sense), landing in a more relevant junior field with much better career prospects and upwards mobility (masters students in this domain are considered skilled workers in my country and compensated at a much higher rate so the growth should be exponential). I will be 29/30 when I finish my masters.\n\nCould you offer me some insight and advice regarding my situation?\n\nThanks!\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nAlso please note that I am located in the EU and so Masters are much more difficult to get into without the requisite bachelor's level courses. Pre-masters courses do exist however beyond a certain number of credits missing, you have to start off at bachelor's anyway. Sadly with a law bachelor's degree I do not fulfill any pre-requisites.\n\nI have considered Georgia Tech's online master's however I am not sure if it is seen as reputable in the EU.

I would also really appreciate anyone in the field providing a little insight into what you do and your work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14p0ha4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ElectricalTennis3776", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14p0ha4/finance_to_data_science/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14p0ha4/finance_to_data_science/", "subreddit_subscribers": 936611, "created_utc": 1688335014.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi friends, we have created a free learning data analysis tool using artificial intelligence.
