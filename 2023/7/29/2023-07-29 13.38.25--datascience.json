Is Conformal Prediction a more modern approach of Probabilistic Forecasting or is it a synonym?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of those above mentioned libs offer Conformal Prediction features? I&amp;#39;ve read that sktime for example &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; has probabilistic forecasting, so I&amp;#39;m unsure which library offers the real deal (in case that there is a difference between the two).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your favorite tools/libs for Conformal Prediction that include all relevant models and are easy to use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What alternative approaches do you use to calculate Conformal Predictions for example when facing a regression problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am very excited for your answers and sorry if I messed up any lingo or anything else!
