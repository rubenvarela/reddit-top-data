The interview was SQL + business case study. The interviewer gave me a dummy table and asked me to produce some queries. The SQL questions were pretty easy. However, I might have messed up as I made 10 CTEs while it could have been done with one simple case statement.\n\nI struggled but arrived at the answer, while constantly discussing my approach with the interviewer and finally, he told me that yes the query would give the desired output (or maybe he wanted to move as I ate 34 mins of the interview)\n\nThe case study was okay-ish. I asked questions (the interviewer liked my questions :p), discussed my approach, made cases, and discussed metrics. I won't say it was a breeze but definitely better than the SQL mess up.\n\nMy question is, especially to HMs, does the level of query matter?

I have a PhD in Politics and during my doctoral journey, I found myself increasingly fascinated by data science methods. As a part of a mixed-method research on political narratives online, I even implemented an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This experience piqued my interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its potential applications in political research.\n\nFast forward to now: I am contemplating diving deeper into data science to fill in my knowledge gaps and boost my capabilities, especially in NLP. My ultimate aim is to further our understanding of AI, its potential biases,  and the effect of online narratives on political events in a research role, preferably outside of academia.\n\nHowever, there's a twist. I'm over 30 and conscious about dedicating what could be crucial career-building years to more academia, especially when I already hold a PhD. I'm exploring the possibility of juggling my research work alongside a Master's, but I'm wary of how this might be perceived - a downgrade or a strategic move?\n\nBut here's the kicker: the cost of a Master's where I live is quite affordable and could help me to strengthen my network, which adds another dimension to my consideration.\n\nSo, fellow Redditors, I turn to you. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any insights, experiences, or pieces of advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**TL;DR:** Post-30s, PhD in Politics, used an unsupervised ML algorithm for doctoral research, now considering a Master's in Data Science to deepen knowledge, especially in NLP. Fees for MA are affordable where I live.

I have a PhD in Politics and during my doctoral journey, I found myself increasingly fascinated by data science methods. As a part of a mixed-method research on political narratives online, I even implemented an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This experience piqued my interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its potential applications in political research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now: I am contemplating diving deeper into data science to fill in my knowledge gaps and boost my capabilities, especially in NLP. My ultimate aim is to further our understanding of AI, its potential biases,  and the effect of online narratives on political events in a research role, preferably outside of academia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s a twist. I&amp;#39;m over 30 and conscious about dedicating what could be crucial career-building years to more academia, especially when I already hold a PhD. I&amp;#39;m exploring the possibility of juggling my research work alongside a Master&amp;#39;s, but I&amp;#39;m wary of how this might be perceived - a downgrade or a strategic move?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the kicker: the cost of a Master&amp;#39;s where I live is quite affordable and could help me to strengthen my network, which adds another dimension to my consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, fellow Redditors, I turn to you. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any insights, experiences, or pieces of advice would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-30s, PhD in Politics, used an unsupervised ML algorithm for doctoral research, now considering a Master&amp;#39;s in Data Science to deepen knowledge, especially in NLP. Fees for MA are affordable where I live.
