But OutSystems is not really data analytics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At Company X, my tasks were:\n-Support in daily operations, e.g., in the evaluation of machine data\n- Assistance in technical projects, potentially taking on smaller projects\n- Operating data analysis of gas turbines, generators, and steam turbines\n- Maintenance of engineering databases&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company Y alluded to the fact that there might be a possibility to transition the co-op position to a full-time position for me after working there for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company X, on the other hand, told me indirectly that it is difficult to get any entry level position at this company at this time and so far i have not heard of anyone doing so, except one guy who told me he converted his master thesis work to a full-time position there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company Y i only know and work with my department, which are 2 people. Thats my current network.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company X i was working with other departments aswell, so I kind of could ask around and leverage that network to get any entry level job at Company X, preferably as a data analyst. But its a big risk and big IF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The industry of Company X (gas and turbines) is closely related to my masters degree (aerospace engineering). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The industry of Company Y (transportation systems, mainly trains) is not really an area of my interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company X and Company Y are sister companies of the same parent company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, i miss my work, life and the people from Company X, thats why a part of wants to return just because of that. But i need to make a rational decision here, especially considering my future career growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Should I risk it and return? Or stay put where I am and atleast get the foot in the door with Company Y, and then leverage it to get a position at Company X in data analytics?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for guiding me out of this confusion :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "15dd5wy", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BridgeOk4023", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/15dd5wy/i_want_an_entry_level_job_as_a_data_analyst_at/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15dd5wy/i_want_an_entry_level_job_as_a_data_analyst_at/", "subreddit_subscribers": 967810, "created_utc": 1690694552.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hey Redditors, your wisdom is needed!\n\nSo, here's my story.
