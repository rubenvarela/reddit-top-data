I have a PhD in Politics and during my doctoral journey, I found myself increasingly fascinated by data science methods. As a part of a mixed-method research on political narratives online, I even implemented an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This experience piqued my interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its potential applications in political research.\n\nFast forward to now: I am contemplating diving deeper into data science to fill in my knowledge gaps and boost my capabilities, especially in NLP.
