They told him he could apply to transfer his major to Data Engineering after this semester, but he may not get into the program then either. In the meantime, his Industrial Engineering classes are not relevant to the Data Engineering coursework, so he would essentially be setting himself back a semester.\n\nIn addition to this, we have a 2yo and are expecting our second in September (they\u2019re due the first week of classes at TAMU). We\u2019ve been looking for housing but have been told that for our budget (2BR under $1100/month), we should not expect to find anything that doesn\u2019t have cockroaches. Most places we\u2019ve looked at also have rats, mold, and other health hazards we don\u2019t want to expose our kiddos to.\n\nFinally, my husband is a first-gen college student and going back later in life. He started college straight out of high school, but without the support he needed and going to a school out of state, he ended up dropping out. He\u2019s now returning at 32 because the career path he wants to pursue (AI development) requires a degree. Financially, TAMU is going to put us in a lot of debt.\n\nAll this to say, everyone keeps telling him \u201cYou got into a great school for engineering, you should accept what they give you and move on,\u201d but he\u2019s worried that the industrial engineering degree won\u2019t address the concepts he wants to learn for the career he wants to pursue, and he doesn\u2019t want to go through an extra semester and incurring more debt without the guarantee that he\u2019d be able to transfer majors.\n\nHe\u2019s considering withdrawing from this semester\u2019s classes at TAMU and transferring to the University of Texas in San Antonio in the Spring to major in CompSci with a focus on data science and a minor in statistics.\n\nThis option is much more affordable in terms of living expenses (it seems like housing isn\u2019t as insane in San Antonio as College Station?) and also he would qualify for a lot more scholarships and grants at UTSA than he currently does at TAMU. We could also stay with my dad during the fall semester to save money instead of spending a few thousand on housing. Also, we have family in the San Antonio area, while in College Station we have no connections or sense of community.\n\nHis concern is he has heard TAMU has a great alumni network that guarantees a job coming out of school, and he\u2019s not sure if UTSA has a similar network or as many career opportunities for their grads (this is not a slight to UTSA, more so that\u2019s just a huge bragging point of TAMU and he doesn\u2019t know how UTSA compares.)\n\nWe both would greatly appreciate your perspectives on whether the transfer seems worth it or if you think he would be better off long-term staying at TAMU for career opportunities coming out of college.

We have some situations where some of the questions regarding sentiment and spending behavior ( a categorical variable ) are left unanswered and we've been playing around with ways to fill in segments.\n\nI have other variables such as the demographic breakdown of the survey participant and the date (year/month/day) the survey was answered. When we look at the survey responses where the participant did answer the question (i.e did not leave it blank) we found that there is a pretty significant relationship between the variable we are trying to fill and the demographic variables, date-time variable, and other sentiment question responses.\n\nSo the current plan is to train a model (XGBoost/LightGBM/Logistic Regression/etc.) on the completed survey responses and then using the trained model to get the probability a particular survey participant falls within a certain class. Every week I get a new dump of survey responses into the database which needs to be classified.\n\nHad two main questions here:\n\n1.) How to take into consideration the variable of time into this exercise? What is the best way to encode this variable, and since the datetime someone responded to a survey has a fairly significant relationship to the target variable here, but we're not necessarily concerned with predicting into the future, are there still problems here with respect to data leakage that needs to be taken into account?\n\n2.) When using tree-based models, what is the best way to interpret the probability score?

We have some situations where some of the questions regarding sentiment and spending behavior ( a categorical variable ) are left unanswered and we&amp;#39;ve been playing around with ways to fill in segments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have other variables such as the demographic breakdown of the survey participant and the date (year/month/day) the survey was answered. When we look at the survey responses where the participant did answer the question (i.e did not leave it blank) we found that there is a pretty significant relationship between the variable we are trying to fill and the demographic variables, date-time variable, and other sentiment question responses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the current plan is to train a model (XGBoost/LightGBM/Logistic Regression/etc.) on the completed survey responses and then using the trained model to get the probability a particular survey participant falls within a certain class. Every week I get a new dump of survey responses into the database which needs to be classified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had two main questions here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.)
