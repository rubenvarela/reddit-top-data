A/B testing and experiments in general is something I rarely see DS talking about while statisticians do. Usually the mindset is to just use the data that is present while generating new, fit-for-purpose data might be the way to go.

Don't just build dashboards or models ad infinitum if you have no way of knowing they improve the status-quo.\n5. **Your organization has finite resources, should they spend it on data?** The answer, as usual, is it depends. I've seen too many cases of data being the end and not the means. Unless it's pure R&amp;D it should honestly be treated like acquiring a new CRM/ERP or whatever. There should be some sort of a cost-benefit analysis.\n6. **A big part of AI is hypercharged automation and this is where it brings the most value.** From this perspective it's just code you do not need to write. Secondly, the problem could be so complex that no human *could* hard code it (e.g., try hard coding chatGPT). Let that sink in. Are you fine with having part of your codebase being blackbox? From this perspective it's can also be seen technical debt. What's harder for you to maintain, your model being up-to-date or your business rules? Depends on your context and you should factor this in, maybe you can elicit rules from a whitebox algorithm turn them in code. Especially matters for regulatory purposes.\n7. **The elephant in the room: Machine learning is an expensive rolls royce.** There's a bunch of artifacts you need to have a succesful ML project which require a unicorn that wears many hats (infra, ops, software, stats) or a small team. In many cases if executed well it would be profitable, but it doesn't have to be *just* profitable, it needs to bring in more than any other investment the business can do. A lessons learnt from software is: the complexity of your system needs to be proportionate to the difficulty of the problem you're solving.\n8. **If you want to drive that rolls royce join a team that lets you.** I think there's no shame in wanting to be a DS that mostly or even exclusively does AI/ML. The reality is that it's not going to be valuable at every organization.\n9. **Don't avoid or overuse generative AI.** LLM's are truly groundbreaking. On top of that, having them behind an API in the cloud makes everything easier. Call the API, get the embeddings, solve your problem. It's so tempting that some people are using LLM's to solve very simple problems. Don't cut a tomato with a chainsaw after all.

Would it be possible/advisable to include some of these original features in the meta model creation, e.g. feature_1 where I know that some models perform better for certain categories within this feature than others?\n\n Is there any problems in doing this and subsequently using the probabilities output? Extrapolating further, would it be inadvisable to include all original features in the meta model alongside each base models' predictions?

We\u2019ve been looking for housing but have been told that for our budget (2BR under $1100/month), we should not expect to find anything that doesn\u2019t have cockroaches. Most places we\u2019ve looked at also have rats, mold, and other health hazards we don\u2019t want to expose our kiddos to.\n\nFinally, my husband is a first-gen college student and going back later in life. He started college straight out of high school, but without the support he needed and going to a school out of state, he ended up dropping out. He\u2019s now returning at 32 because the career path he wants to pursue (AI development) requires a degree. Financially, TAMU is going to put us in a lot of debt.\n\nAll this to say, everyone keeps telling him \u201cYou got into a great school for engineering, you should accept what they give you and move on,\u201d but he\u2019s worried that the industrial engineering degree won\u2019t address the concepts he wants to learn for the career he wants to pursue, and he doesn\u2019t want to go through an extra semester and incurring more debt without the guarantee that he\u2019d be able to transfer majors.\n\nHe\u2019s considering withdrawing from this semester\u2019s classes at TAMU and transferring to the University of Texas in San Antonio in the Spring to major in CompSci with a focus on data science and a minor in statistics.\n\nThis option is much more affordable in terms of living expenses (it seems like housing isn\u2019t as insane in San Antonio as College Station?) and also he would qualify for a lot more scholarships and grants at UTSA than he currently does at TAMU. We could also stay with my dad during the fall semester to save money instead of spending a few thousand on housing. Also, we have family in the San Antonio area, while in College Station we have no connections or sense of community.\n\nHis concern is he has heard TAMU has a great alumni network that guarantees a job coming out of school, and he\u2019s not sure if UTSA has a similar network or as many career opportunities for their grads (this is not a slight to UTSA, more so that\u2019s just a huge bragging point of TAMU and he doesn\u2019t know how UTSA compares.)\n\nWe both would greatly appreciate your perspectives on whether the transfer seems worth it or if you think he would be better off long-term staying at TAMU for career opportunities coming out of college.
