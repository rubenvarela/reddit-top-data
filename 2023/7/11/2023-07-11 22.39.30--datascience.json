It's still all about solving problems and creating value from data. The science part comes in because data is a tough beast to tame, the vast majority of (non-DS) professionals still don't understand the difference between correlation and causation.\n2. **Solving problems means doing it better, cheaper or both.** This is where the low-hanging fruit of our domain, dataviz, comes into play. These are approachable tools to find a way to improve processeses.\n3. **Don't forget about experimentation.** You cannot draw conclusions from data you simply don't have. A/B testing and experiments in general is something I rarely see DS talking about while statisticians do. Usually the mindset is to just use the data that is present while generating new, fit-for-purpose data might be the way to go. This especially matters if you want to make causal claims which people actually demand for some applications.\n4. **Don't deploy what you can't monitor and adapt.** Very related to all 3 previous points. Each \"intervention\" you do based on data should only be done if you have measurable outcomes. Don't just build dashboards or models ad infinitum if you have no way of knowing they improve the status-quo.\n5. **Your organization has finite resources, should they spend it on data?** The answer, as usual, is it depends. I've seen too many cases of data being the end and not the means. Unless it's pure R&amp;D it should honestly be treated like acquiring a new CRM/ERP or whatever. There should be some sort of a cost-benefit analysis.\n6. **A big part of AI is hypercharged automation and this is where it brings the most value.** From this perspective it's just code you do not need to write. Secondly, the problem could be so complex that no human *could* hard code it (e.g., try hard coding chatGPT). Let that sink in. Are you fine with having part of your codebase being blackbox? From this perspective it's can also be seen technical debt. What's harder for you to maintain, your model being up-to-date or your business rules? Depends on your context and you should factor this in, maybe you can elicit rules from a whitebox algorithm turn them in code. Especially matters for regulatory purposes.\n7. **The elephant in the room: Machine learning is an expensive rolls royce.** There's a bunch of artifacts you need to have a succesful ML project which require a unicorn that wears many hats (infra, ops, software, stats) or a small team. In many cases if executed well it would be profitable, but it doesn't have to be *just* profitable, it needs to bring in more than any other investment the business can do. A lessons learnt from software is: the complexity of your system needs to be proportionate to the difficulty of the problem you're solving.\n8. **If you want to drive that rolls royce join a team that lets you.** I think there's no shame in wanting to be a DS that mostly or even exclusively does AI/ML. The reality is that it's not going to be valuable at every organization.\n9. **Don't avoid or overuse generative AI.** LLM's are truly groundbreaking. On top of that, having them behind an API in the cloud makes everything easier. Call the API, get the embeddings, solve your problem. It's so tempting that some people are using LLM's to solve very simple problems. Don't cut a tomato with a chainsaw after all. From a business pov this might be fine though, recently I had a CV project that I used stable diffusion for. The results were worse and stable diffusion was an overkill, but the ML part took less than a day while before this would've taken a lot longer (collecting, training, evaluating, ...) from a cost-benefit pov this made perfect sense.\n10. **Beware of the grifters and fake gurus.** Sometimes I joke that the current AI hype reminds me of blockchain 5 years ago. It's an unfair comparison because I truly believe this stuff has a lot more value than blockchain but both of them are somewhat oversold. The biggest parallel we can draw between both is that there's tons of grifters in the space making all sorts of claims that are demonstrably false / overpromising ML's capabilities.

E.g. if one feature (feature_1) has 3 discrete options (A, B, C), while the RF may perform best overall, a different model type might perform better on classifications specific to category B than the RF model. \n\n\nThe few articles I've read on creating ensemble models, use a meta model with each base models probability predictions as the input features of the train dataset, but none of the base models' train dataset features. Would it be possible/advisable to include some of these original features in the meta model creation, e.g. feature_1 where I know that some models perform better for certain categories within this feature than others?\n\n Is there any problems in doing this and subsequently using the probabilities output? Extrapolating further, would it be inadvisable to include all original features in the meta model alongside each base models' predictions? In general if I'm interested in the probabilities of the meta model classifier, should I calibrate the end meta model instead using an Isotonic regression? \n\n\nFor context, while this is a classification problem I'm interested in the computed probability as the primary output; I calibrate my RF model at the end using an Isotonic regression to hopefully improve the output probabilities. I have around 60k rows of data with around 50 base features, with another 50 ish created by me.

We\u2019ve been looking for housing but have been told that for our budget (2BR under $1100/month), we should not expect to find anything that doesn\u2019t have cockroaches. Most places we\u2019ve looked at also have rats, mold, and other health hazards we don\u2019t want to expose our kiddos to.\n\nFinally, my husband is a first-gen college student and going back later in life. He started college straight out of high school, but without the support he needed and going to a school out of state, he ended up dropping out. He\u2019s now returning at 32 because the career path he wants to pursue (AI development) requires a degree. Financially, TAMU is going to put us in a lot of debt.\n\nAll this to say, everyone keeps telling him \u201cYou got into a great school for engineering, you should accept what they give you and move on,\u201d but he\u2019s worried that the industrial engineering degree won\u2019t address the concepts he wants to learn for the career he wants to pursue, and he doesn\u2019t want to go through an extra semester and incurring more debt without the guarantee that he\u2019d be able to transfer majors.\n\nHe\u2019s considering withdrawing from this semester\u2019s classes at TAMU and transferring to the University of Texas in San Antonio in the Spring to major in CompSci with a focus on data science and a minor in statistics.\n\nThis option is much more affordable in terms of living expenses (it seems like housing isn\u2019t as insane in San Antonio as College Station?) and also he would qualify for a lot more scholarships and grants at UTSA than he currently does at TAMU. We could also stay with my dad during the fall semester to save money instead of spending a few thousand on housing. Also, we have family in the San Antonio area, while in College Station we have no connections or sense of community.\n\nHis concern is he has heard TAMU has a great alumni network that guarantees a job coming out of school, and he\u2019s not sure if UTSA has a similar network or as many career opportunities for their grads (this is not a slight to UTSA, more so that\u2019s just a huge bragging point of TAMU and he doesn\u2019t know how UTSA compares.)\n\nWe both would greatly appreciate your perspectives on whether the transfer seems worth it or if you think he would be better off long-term staying at TAMU for career opportunities coming out of college.

It&amp;#39;s chill, it&amp;#39;s not like they are put out or annoyed by it... but on paper it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to keep me on payroll if they don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also talk of having me stay on, but remote and part time and help with the small peanuts data/report pulling and gathering to send back consolidated stuff while I&amp;#39;m at school&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am just feeling sorta weird since I&amp;#39;m 9-5 but only worked like maybe 50% of that today since I had to wait on my manager to give me a task...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14x4skv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SwiftfulEnding", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14x4skv/starting_to_feel_useless_at_my_job/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14x4skv/starting_to_feel_useless_at_my_job/", "subreddit_subscribers": 945588, "created_utc": 1689112413.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I am a python developer, started python for data science but git deep into it and left data science .
