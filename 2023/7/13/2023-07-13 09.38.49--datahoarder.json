There are other 2 drives in the DAS (one is the same model, the other is a shucked WD elements). All drives are EXT4 formatted. I'm using Mergerfs to combine those drives in a single folder. the machines (both the DAS and Mini PC) are connected to the battery powered plugs of a Cyber Power Cyverenergy \u200eOM900ATLCD. The pwrstatd daemon is supposedly configured appropiately in Debian. We have had some power outages during the last weeks and the UPS quicks in, then after some minutes the devices are powered off. Systemd logs the message sent by the pwrstatd daemon and powers off everything correctly. \n\nOn April 10, as part as some routine checks I regularly perform, I have noticed that there were files that were reported as not found by the system. Doing ls inside a directory with files giving those errors was raising \"no such file or directory\" or something similar. Then, I unmounted all drives and checked one by one with e2fsck (sudo e2fsck -v -p -y /dev/sc1). I have read that there were blocks that contained garbage or something similar.

I\u2019m looking at hard drives and not sure between WD and Seagate. I\u2019ve always purchased WD in the past. I\u2019m looking at the WD prices $320 for 20 TB and $409 (or 2 for $700) on the WD site. Any suggestions? This will be mainly for Plex and photo storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1b45c7c8-4b25-11ed-a1f3-5a29a1a8c4d9", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4co", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#cc3600", "id": "14xx2yc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stryker412", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/synology/comments/14xx2yc/looking_to_buy_20_or_22tb_for_a_new_1522/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/14xx2yc/looking_to_buy_20_or_22tb_for_a_new_1522/", "subreddit_subscribers": 125276, "created_utc": 1689187703.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1689187735.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.synology", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/synology/comments/14xx2yc/looking_to_buy_20_or_22tb_for_a_new_1522/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "14xx3eq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stryker412", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_14xx2yc", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/14xx3eq/looking_to_buy_20_or_22tb_for_a_new_1522/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/synology/comments/14xx2yc/looking_to_buy_20_or_22tb_for_a_new_1522/", "subreddit_subscribers": 692426, "created_utc": 1689187735.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Currently I have a Dell PERC H310 (LSISAS2008) which is a PCIE 2.0 x8 card in an Unraid server that has a SAS backplane and connects up to 24 SATA drives in my case.
