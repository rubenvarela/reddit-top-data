The ML engineer**\nDescription: \n- Literally everything from data eng to MLOps to cloud infra, except actual data science\n- \u201cEnd-to-end ML pipeline\u201d\n- If you use a for loop with pandas data frame, they will bring you to the back alley and shoot you in the head\n\nRequirements: \n- Solve hard leetcode question blindfolded with one arm behind your back\n- Need to know 17 ways to accomplish the exact same thing using AWS/GCP\n- Need to know 5 different databases we don\u2019t even use\n\n**3. The mislabelled data analyst**\nDescription: \n- Nothing but making dashboards\n- Use statistics but not too much that it gives our execs imposter syndrome\n- ML, but it\u2019s logistic regression on Excel\n\nRequirements: \n- Tableau etc\n- Telepathic ability to magically make business people understand basic statistics concepts \n- Willing to be called incompetent by exec when your analysis shows the source of all business problems stemmed from poor management by said exec\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed out some others, and I\u2019ve also seen roles that expects you to do all three.

I just completed Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng and was looking for some advise on what I should do next. Would love to hear input from you guys.\n\nI'm self studying Machine Learning full-time, while I'm also getting a bachelors degree in Computer Science from an online virtual university. It's been 3+ months since I've stepped into Machine Learning and so far I've been developing deep intuition and foundational concepts of Machine Learning . Since I'm really passionate about mathematics, I'm very much focused on understanding the mathematics behind everything.\n\nBy completing this specialization I've developed good foundational concepts of the following:\n\n\u2022 Supervised Machine Learning  \n\u2022 Linear regression  \n\u2022 Logistic regression  \n\u2022 Gradient Descent / Adam Optimizer  \n\u2022 Neural networks  \n\u2022 Bias, variance trade-offs  \n\u2022 Decision trees   \n\u2022 Unsupervised Learning  \n\u2022 Clustering  \n\u2022 Anomaly detection   \n\u2022 Recommenders  \n\u2022 Collaborative filtering  \n\u2022 Content-based filtering  \n\u2022 Reinforcement learning\n\nIn this course I got some exposure to libraries like Tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, pandas as well.\n\nI've realized that there is so much to learn only about ML models that I can spend so much time only learning these models, but as much as I want to do that, my goal is to get a job or internship or projects that I can start earning from as soon as possible. And with that I can continue on learning and getting deeper into ML and AI. With all that I've learnt so far, Supervised / Unsupevised Learning and Neural Networks seemed to me a good path that I can take to land myself a job because of the high demand. I really wanted to dive deeper into reinforcement learning but it seems that it will make it difficult for me to land a job.\n\nThis course was very much focused on intuition building and the mathematics, but I think that now I need to develop skills and focus much on the development side of things. To get myself familiar and comfortable with the libraries and whatever that is important for development so that I can comfortably apply these models in real life.\n\nShould I get more high-level overview of AI to understand what are other topics apart from ML that I can dive in or should I pick some topic in ML and dive deep into it.

I've learned a lot about managing large databases. I want to share my insights and discoveries to perhaps help someone who might be facing similar challenges. In this article I reveal the critical aspects of database management and some practical tips to navigate common obstacles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How to manage large databases\n\nManaging databases can pose a fair share of challenges, primarily due to the size and intricacy of the data involved. Companies frequently grapple with how to effectively handle and manage the impact of data growth, especially when the database management systems struggle to keep pace.\n\nProblems sometimes stem from disregarded issues during the initial stages of the process. This could be because the prevailing technology was presumed to inherently manage these complexities. Hence, the secret lies in having a robust plan for handling large, intricate databases, particularly when significant data growth is expected, whether predictably or otherwise.\n\n# Data Size is Significant\n\nThe size of a database is pivotal as it impacts both performance and management approaches. The way data is processed and stored influences how the database is managed, and this holds true for data both in transit and at rest. For many large firms, data is priceless, and an increase in data could drastically alter their procedures. Therefore, planning ahead for data growth in a database is vital.\n\nIn my work with databases, I've witnessed customers struggle with performance issues and managing considerable data growth. Questions often arise, such as whether to normalize or denormalize the tables.\n\n# The Art of Normalizing Tables\n\nTable normalization is beneficial as it safeguards data integrity, curtails redundancy, and organizes data more efficiently for management, analysis, and extraction. However, normalized tables can come with performance penalties and potentially slow down queries due to the need for multiple joins when retrieving data.\n\nConversely, denormalized tables optimize retrieval primarily through indexing or using the primary key, allowing data to be stored in a buffer for faster access than performing multiple disk seeks. But they compromise data integrity and can lead to rapid database growth.\n\n# Understanding Database Complexity\n\nPerformance penalties can often arise with large and complex databases. In these scenarios, it is often more effective to manage and process these complex calculations using backend programming languages, rather than utilizing the database directly.\n\n# Selecting the Right Database Engine\n\nThe performance of a database server hinges on the data structure used and how it interacts with the queries made and the data retrieved from the table. The specific engine\u2019s data structure and the queries you apply to retrieve targeted data directly impact your database server\u2019s performance.\n\nWhen dealing with a multitude of databases, using the right engine in combination with your queries and the data you need to store and retrieve can yield excellent performance. However, this necessitates a comprehensive analysis of your needs to establish the right database environment.\n\n# Right Tools for Large Databases\n\nManaging a large database can be challenging without a robust platform to support the process. Even with skilled database engineers, there\u2019s always a risk of human error with the database server in use. Any misstep in altering configuration parameters or variables could lead to significant changes, potentially reducing the server\u2019s performance.\n\n# Some tips for working with databases:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Pick the right data types for your columns. It saves space and makes queries run faster.\n* Use normalization rules to keep data tidy and avoid repeats.\n* Regularly maintain your database. Think about tasks like rebuilding indexes and updating stats.\n* Add indexes to columns you query a lot to speed things up, but don't go overboard.\n* Write neat database queries with the right joins and filters. Keep an eye on how they perform.\n* Keep a regular backup of your database for safety. Don't forget to check the backups are okay.\n* Use good security to keep your database safe from unauthorized access.\n* Use tools to keep tabs on how your database is performing. Spot and fix bottlenecks early.\n* Build your database to grow. It'll make adding more data easier down the line.\n* Keep track of your database layout, settings, and data flow. It helps when you need to solve problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo conclude, managing large databases in 2023 necessitates not only understanding the fundamental concepts but also the use of the right tools and strategies. Through careful planning and strategic execution, you can surmount the complexities of large database management, ensuring optimal performance and robust data integrity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI share more articles like this in my blog.

I am open to starting at a lower level of seniority in a company if they are willing to support me in learning the English language. Thanks in advance for your answers or comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "155ntvk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hernanmontes", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/155ntvk/i_am_a_data_scientist_from_colombia_and_i_want_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/155ntvk/i_am_a_data_scientist_from_colombia_and_i_want_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 955745, "created_utc": 1689945522.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
