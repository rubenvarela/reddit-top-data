I&amp;#39;ve been able to land 3 interviews, but all involved receiving substantial take-home assignments. For example, I spent two full days on a data analysis task, only to be told after submission that the company doesn&amp;#39;t accept remote work\u2014a detail they could have noted from my CV before assigning the task (I am from a different city, none of the job postings that I got a response from say whether the job is on site, has a hybrid mode or is full remote).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my second interview, when I asked about the possibility of remote work, their response was vague. They asked me to complete the assignment first, saying &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ll see what we can do.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve spent three days on this task already, and it&amp;#39;s not finished yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My concern is that these lengthy assignments might be a waste of time if companies aren&amp;#39;t considering critical details among the top lines of my CV beforehand. This process has led to disappointment and unnecessary time investment as you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a common practice in the data science field - giving extensive tasks before a thorough CV review?

I dont really have a taste for. Sure there is a couple of DS/ML projects, which I have mostly been the one leading the initiative on (because it's fun but also because I think we can get value out of it).
