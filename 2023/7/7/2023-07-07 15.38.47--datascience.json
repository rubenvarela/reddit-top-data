Boss agrees to give me resources, allocates me 2 new people (both also as unfamiliar with everything as I am but I guess it&amp;#39;s a start). The call ends on a somewhat chilly note.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since then my boss has been on my back ALL the time. About issues that have nothing to do with this project. If I put a figure in an e-mail, my boss calls me with questions &amp;quot;where did you get that from?&amp;quot; etc. Keep in mind that I have been doing that other stuff for 3 years already with no issues and with never a single complaint. Now suddenly because I am not an expert at this new project, everything I ever did or will do is being questioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone offer any advice?
