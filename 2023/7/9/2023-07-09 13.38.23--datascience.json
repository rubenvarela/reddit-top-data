Due to the nature of the company, I ended up doing a lot more than what is traditionally expected of a DS role, and this includes a lot of engineering tasks which I really enjoyed. However, this makes me feel very insecure about being a jack of all trades instead of a master in modeling. \n\nTo start off with a little background, I have a B.Sc in Mathematics and minor in Statistical modelling, I have a pretty decent understanding of theoretical foundations of classic ML as well as neural networks. I have a year worth of experience as an analyst that specializes in SQL and Python before my current DS job. \n\nWhen I started wit my current job, they have a very mature engineering team, but not at all on the data side. It was a really strange place because here were A LOT of data but unused and uncleaned. Somehow for so long, apart from the BI, they never thought of doing any sort of data science stuff. Anyway, I started out as any business-oriented DS role: fumbling around the database to look for good quality data to construct a training set, and talking to business owners and domain experts. After the model is being developed, I was tasked to deploy it to production. It's not exactly what I signed up for, but back then I thought it was fun, and there wasn't anymore potential use of ML in the business except for improving the one model we can afford to build. Due to that, I had to learn about building microservices, AWS, serverless, CI/CD and other DevOps practices. \n\nEventually, the business expanded (like A LOT thanks to Covid) and they hired another DS whose only focus was model development and I ended up building and managing ML infrastructure. Since then, I was thrown with mainly Data Engineering tasks such as building a data lake (not even for the DS team) and feature store using Spark, Kafka and Airflow. Honestly I like these a lot more than modeling, but I feel like I'm massively missing out as someone in ML because I almost never touching model unless it's to convert Jupyter code to training script.\n\nCurrently, I am working on building a distributed training pipeline with Kubernetes, whereas my teammate is doing all the actual data science work. I feel like even though I have a decent theoretical understanding of modern tech such as transformers, I am really missing out on the hands on experiences with finetuning and training LLMs. And due to having to spend so much time learning about the engineering side of things, it becomes so much harder to keep up with new papers and new modeling techniques. \n\nSo I guess my questions is, will I be able to stay relevant to the field if I spread myself out and develop more data engineering and MLOps skills?

Due to the nature of the company, I ended up doing a lot more than what is traditionally expected of a DS role, and this includes a lot of engineering tasks which I really enjoyed. However, this makes me feel very insecure about being a jack of all trades instead of a master in modeling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To start off with a little background, I have a B.Sc in Mathematics and minor in Statistical modelling, I have a pretty decent understanding of theoretical foundations of classic ML as well as neural networks. I have a year worth of experience as an analyst that specializes in SQL and Python before my current DS job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I started wit my current job, they have a very mature engineering team, but not at all on the data side. It was a really strange place because here were A LOT of data but unused and uncleaned. Somehow for so long, apart from the BI, they never thought of doing any sort of data science stuff. Anyway, I started out as any business-oriented DS role: fumbling around the database to look for good quality data to construct a training set, and talking to business owners and domain experts. After the model is being developed, I was tasked to deploy it to production. It&amp;#39;s not exactly what I signed up for, but back then I thought it was fun, and there wasn&amp;#39;t anymore potential use of ML in the business except for improving the one model we can afford to build. Due to that, I had to learn about building microservices, AWS, serverless, CI/CD and other DevOps practices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the business expanded (like A LOT thanks to Covid) and they hired another DS whose only focus was model development and I ended up building and managing ML infrastructure. Since then, I was thrown with mainly Data Engineering tasks such as building a data lake (not even for the DS team) and feature store using Spark, Kafka and Airflow. Honestly I like these a lot more than modeling, but I feel like I&amp;#39;m massively missing out as someone in ML because I almost never touching model unless it&amp;#39;s to convert Jupyter code to training script.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am working on building a distributed training pipeline with Kubernetes, whereas my teammate is doing all the actual data science work. I feel like even though I have a decent theoretical understanding of modern tech such as transformers, I am really missing out on the hands on experiences with finetuning and training LLMs. And due to having to spend so much time learning about the engineering side of things, it becomes so much harder to keep up with new papers and new modeling techniques. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess my questions is, will I be able to stay relevant to the field if I spread myself out and develop more data engineering and MLOps skills? Or should I focus on the modeling aspect and be specialized in DS?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,
