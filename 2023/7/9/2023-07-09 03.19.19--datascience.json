E.g. in this paper ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01229.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01229.pdf)), sensitivity increases from 78.6% to 85.7% and specificity from 88.4% to 92.4%. Applications to tabular data, though, are hard to find, and I am struggling with the intuition on why synthetic data would significantly improve ML performance.\n\nI did come across the following blogpost from synthetic data company mostly AI ([https://mostly.ai/blog/boost-machine-learning-accuracy-with-synthetic-data](https://mostly.ai/blog/boost-machine-learning-accuracy-with-synthetic-data)) where AUC increases from 91.9% to 92.8% by running an XGboost model on a synthetic set of size 1000k instead of a real set of size 10k. According to the author, the claimed improvement (which isnt too high) is due to:  \n*\"The performance of machine learning models can be in fact improved by training on synthetic data in place of the real data. This is possible as the synthetic data helps these models to learn and understand patterns by 1) providing significantly more samples than otherwise available in the original data, and by 2) providing specifically more samples of any minority classes that would otherwise remain under-represented.\"*\n\nThe AUC improvement I mentioned was on a relatively balanced dataset, so mainly the authors point 1) is of interest here. I don't know if the claim that the model 'learns to understand patterns better' is a valid one. For me, the synthetic data just adds some extra randomness to the dataset and thereby prevents overfitting. I thus see the use of synthetic data mainly as a form of regularization. Then again, the improvements in the computer vision paper are quite significant so maybe there is more going on there but I can't quite grasp what that is.

E.g. in this paper (&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01229.pdf\"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01229.pdf&lt;/a&gt;), sensitivity increases from 78.6% to 85.7% and specificity from 88.4% to 92.4%. Applications to tabular data, though, are hard to find, and I am struggling with the intuition on why synthetic data would significantly improve ML performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did come across the following blogpost from synthetic data company mostly AI (&lt;a href=\"https://mostly.ai/blog/boost-machine-learning-accuracy-with-synthetic-data\"&gt;https://mostly.ai/blog/boost-machine-learning-accuracy-with-synthetic-data&lt;/a&gt;) where AUC increases from 91.9% to 92.8% by running an XGboost model on a synthetic set of size 1000k instead of a real set of size 10k. According to the author, the claimed improvement (which isnt too high) is due to:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The performance of machine learning models can be in fact improved by training on synthetic data in place of the real data. This is possible as the synthetic data helps these models to learn and understand patterns by 1) providing significantly more samples than otherwise available in the original data, and by 2) providing specifically more samples of any minority classes that would otherwise remain under-represented.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The AUC improvement I mentioned was on a relatively balanced dataset, so mainly the authors point 1) is of interest here. I don&amp;#39;t know if the claim that the model &amp;#39;learns to understand patterns better&amp;#39; is a valid one. For me, the synthetic data just adds some extra randomness to the dataset and thereby prevents overfitting. I thus see the use of synthetic data mainly as a form of regularization.

Like, hearing someone is a data analyst, a data scientist, a data engineer... \n\n\"Wow! That is so cool! Do you work at NASA or something? Where do you keep your supercomputer? How long did it take you to get your PhD? You don't have one? Wow you must be really damn smart\"\n\n\nBeing hired someplace and being in the data field filled like an actual honest-to-got achievement. Going to work at an office and thinking about the entire grand scheme of things, that there were so many other positions and you got hired into this extremely cool field, it felt like you were this exceptional person. Writing on whiteboards or using an expo marker on some clear glass windows. It was like one of those cool movies or TV shows where you see like the extremely brilliant genius people doing something awesome\n\n\nNow? \n\n\"Who cares? Oh you're a data scientist? Big deal, I've met like 30 of them in the past week alone. I bet you work in Excel or something. Big whoop. That must be so exciting /s\"\n\n\nGoing to work, you're just an average everyday person. No one seems like they are excited or truly passionate, they are just there for the short-term until they find another position That offers something slightly incrementally better or they get bored. It's a revolving door of apathetic people who don't truly care....\n\n\n**Hard work also doesn't seem to mean much now**. I have repeatedly binged learning, studying machine learning AI databases python SQL, etc etc, and I've done it in a way that's not mentally healthy as well. When I say binge, I mean literally study 30 hours in excess of my 40-hour work week every single week to boast about how much I've learned, how much I've achieved, how advanced my skills are. And you know what? No one cares. My employer didn't care. **I was told straight up by my last boss: it's corporate policy that we don't promote in role. Your job needs to change completely, or you must apply to a completely new role and requisition in order to get a promotion**. So in other words, it doesn't matter how well you do, how hard you work, no matter what you have achieved. You must apply to a new position entirely.

Like, hearing someone is a data analyst, a data scientist, a data engineer... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wow! That is so cool! Do you work at NASA or something? Where do you keep your supercomputer? How long did it take you to get your PhD? You don&amp;#39;t have one? Wow you must be really damn smart&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being hired someplace and being in the data field filled like an actual honest-to-got achievement. Going to work at an office and thinking about the entire grand scheme of things, that there were so many other positions and you got hired into this extremely cool field, it felt like you were this exceptional person. Writing on whiteboards or using an expo marker on some clear glass windows. It was like one of those cool movies or TV shows where you see like the extremely brilliant genius people doing something awesome&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who cares? Oh you&amp;#39;re a data scientist? Big deal, I&amp;#39;ve met like 30 of them in the past week alone. I bet you work in Excel or something. Big whoop. That must be so exciting /s&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going to work, you&amp;#39;re just an average everyday person. No one seems like they are excited or truly passionate, they are just there for the short-term until they find another position That offers something slightly incrementally better or they get bored. It&amp;#39;s a revolving door of apathetic people who don&amp;#39;t truly care....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard work also doesn&amp;#39;t seem to mean much now&lt;/strong&gt;. I have repeatedly binged learning, studying machine learning AI databases python SQL, etc etc, and I&amp;#39;ve done it in a way that&amp;#39;s not mentally healthy as well. When I say binge, I mean literally study 30 hours in excess of my 40-hour work week every single week to boast about how much I&amp;#39;ve learned, how much I&amp;#39;ve achieved, how advanced my skills are. And you know what? No one cares. My employer didn&amp;#39;t care. &lt;strong&gt;I was told straight up by my last boss: it&amp;#39;s corporate policy that we don&amp;#39;t promote in role. Your job needs to change completely, or you must apply to a completely new role and requisition in order to get a promotion&lt;/strong&gt;.
