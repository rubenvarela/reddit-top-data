Honestly I like these a lot more than modeling, but I feel like I&amp;#39;m massively missing out as someone in ML because I almost never touching model unless it&amp;#39;s to convert Jupyter code to training script.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am working on building a distributed training pipeline with Kubernetes, whereas my teammate is doing all the actual data science work. I feel like even though I have a decent theoretical understanding of modern tech such as transformers, I am really missing out on the hands on experiences with finetuning and training LLMs. And due to having to spend so much time learning about the engineering side of things, it becomes so much harder to keep up with new papers and new modeling techniques. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess my questions is, will I be able to stay relevant to the field if I spread myself out and develop more data engineering and MLOps skills? Or should I focus on the modeling aspect and be specialized in DS?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14uw0s2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xy_is_ham", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14uw0s2/midlevel_data_scientist_needs_career_progression/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14uw0s2/midlevel_data_scientist_needs_career_progression/", "subreddit_subscribers": 943167, "created_utc": 1688901334.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I love exploring the Dask library and am thrilled with its superpower computing capabilities \n\nAnyone else like it too?\n\nIf so share your fun tips and tricks please X", "author_fullname": "t2_ueb4qpts", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tips and tricks optimising Dask (fun question and accurate/serious answers only please)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "tooling", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_14ugf1x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tooling", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1688852815.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love exploring the Dask library and am thrilled with its superpower computing capabilities &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else like it too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If so share your fun tips and tricks please X&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "aaf5d8cc-d780-11e7-a4a5-0e68d01eab56", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "14ugf1x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "snoo_snoozin", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/14ugf1x/tips_and_tricks_optimising_dask_fun_question_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14ugf1x/tips_and_tricks_optimising_dask_fun_question_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 943167, "created_utc": 1688852815.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Well, I know this is already discussed several times in the past.
