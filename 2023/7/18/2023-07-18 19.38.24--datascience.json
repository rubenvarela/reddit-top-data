I also am currently working essentially as a DA (titled Yield Manager) for one of the top US entertainment media companies. I have 2 and a half years left on my program before I graduate. I\u2019m looking to apply my MA in Econ, 3-4 years of DA experience by that point, and projects/certs I accomplish in that time towards breaking into a DS role for another big company (or the one I currently work at). Despite my course work being very math/stats heavy, I\u2019m worried that any employer will immediately overlook my resume at that point for another candidate with a MS in DS, Stats, CS, Math, Econ, etc. Will this significantly hurt my opportunities at breaking into a DS role at a big company? And if so, should i drop out and apply for a MS program somewhere else?
