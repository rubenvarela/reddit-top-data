Now i have things organised properly, individual harddrive codename identifiers, copies of spreadsheets and \u2018read-me\u2019 files on every drives top-level folder explaining the organisation process and how to access things with certain programs, multiple backup copes, and a master-backup copy kept safe in an off-site location, all explained in files present on every single drive, along with print outs kept with the drives. We\u2019ve also had a talk and i\u2019ve basically said \u201cif anything happens, just plug one of them in and read the files/print outs, to know where everything is kept.\n\nHave any of you ever had this thought and how have you gone about handling the issue?\n\n\nEdit: \nThis has gained quite a bit of traction so thought i\u2019d be a bit more specific as to how i\u2019ve gone about this, and also if i\u2019m missing anything or you have any suggestions please feel free.\n\nI\u2019m a mac user, so I have all of our phone photos stored within the mac\u2019s photos app. This mac has a first line of defence against data loss as a \u2018time machine\u2019 backup on an external NVME SSD, which will usually be kept with the macbook, updated about once a week and labelled accordingly. The second line of defence for this device is a second HDD that has been partitioned into two 1Tb volumes, to contain another time machine backup (updated less regularly, maybe once a month, but still good to have), and the other volume contains the photo exports from the mac\u2019s \u2018photos\u2019 app (so you wont need a mac to view) along with other important documents. This second HDD is kept at my home and won\u2019t travel with the macbook or the first time machine NVME backup, so that if i lost my laptop/everything with it whilst out, i\u2019d not lose the data unless my house simultaneously burnt down. \n\nI also have other hard drives that travel with the macbook, one for my photoshop/lightroom projects and wildlife photography, one for my general media (movies, tv shows, books etc along with another copy of any important documents. These also have back up hard drives which are left at home and updated as often as i can.\n\nThis then all pairs with the \u2018master backup\u2019 consisting of a 20Tb 3.5\u201d drive, a pair of associated power/data cables, associated converters that may be needed (usb-a to usb-c for example), along with a third and final time machine backup. This is kept in a peli case, in an off-site location. \n\nSo to lose everything, i\u2019d need to get robbed of my laptop, whilst two separate locations burnt down. \n\nTo then make this easier for my wife to understand, i have used the phonetic alphabet to effectively \u2018name\u2019 each of my hard-drives. E.g. one called ALPHA, one called BRAVO, one called CHARLIE, etc. and clearly labelled them all as such, along with as much info as possible to their contents. \n\nOn each and every drive including backups, is a top level folder, with an excel spreadsheet, a \u2018read me\u2019 text file. Everything else contained on that drive is within a folder here also, so the text/excel spreadsheet will be clearly seen and not lost in a mess of other files/folders.\n\nThe text file contains a more in-depth explanation on basically everything, starting with the most inportant stuff (prefaced with a few warnings on properly connecting/ejecting the drives, and that certain operating systems can only read certain drives), all the way through to step-by-step guides on how to go about backing a phone up to the hdd system, how to go about taking a backup of a drive, how to go about adding photos from a camera card so they can be edited in lightroom (i will admit that last bit was added as a reminder to myself to avoid a future mish-mash of camera card dump folders simply entitled DCIM with zero hint as to the contents lol), etc etc. \n\nThe spreadsheet paired with the text document then lists all the harddrives, and notes on their format, their size, where they are kept, and a few notes on their contents.\n\nAnd this text/excel document is copied to all of the drives, and is also printed out and kept with my macbook, with my desktop pc, inside the case where i keep all the drives at home, and inside the peli case with my master backups.

Additionally I have 3 additional identical drives,  a second raid card, and batterback up memory that attaches to the card. These should help to diagnose and fix (I hope).   I kept these just in-case, but realized that I don&amp;#39;t have any idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest concern is clicking something incorrectly and losing the information that is there. Some files are irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have limited knowledge, but smart enough to know this is completely out of my league.

It was where my Documents folder was so I think my whole computer is crippled now. I lost all my saved games and I had a YouTube channel uploading cartoons, and I did get the other guy to do what I was gonna do, but that\u2019s basically it. That\u2019s the end of my channel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m getting a new computer sent to me for my job but I wouldn\u2019t be running a channel and doing games on it. I lost my motivation and I\u2019m not even sure I could.
