The model itself performs well but the management wants me to somehow automate the output/insights so it can be translated to other datasets too. I expressed my worries for them as I don't think that it is possible but I was trying my luck here to see maybe there is a method/idea which I am not aware of?\n\nThe only thing I could come up with is looping for each cluster and finding if there is a feature which has a value count of more than 90% (or any threshold) and just saving the cluster-feature-value trio that is answering this condition. I don't know how much I'm up for that method because its very technical and automatic and might miss valuable (for example - If I have a country feature, and let's say if I have 50 countries in a cluster. Maybe the prevelance of all countries is equal to 2% but because 49 of the 50 countries are from Asia so it means 98% of them are from Asia which is a valuable information I am missing).\n\nIs there even any method to do that?
