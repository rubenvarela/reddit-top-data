However, the problem is that almost every data distribution involving human interactions will tend to shift over time and contain some dependency.\n\nLet me give you one example: Let's say we have a web app that lets users submit a picture of an animal and we predict whether it's a dog or not. This seems like a simple problem where you could split by iid because there can't be any data leakage, right?\n\nBut if you think about it, the distribution of photos that get submitted is likely to change over time. It could be from new dog breeds becoming more popular, or from a shift in the types of users that use the platform and the dogs they submit. It could even be due to new phones/cameras being used, or people start posing their photos slightly differently or maybe covid hits and now your service is only getting indoor photos with different lighting whereas previously you got mostly outdoor shots.\n\nThese are all hypothetical examples and you could come up with a million different ones. The point being that the distribution of data for many many (most?) problems will change over time and our goal is almost always to train on historical data and predict on future unseen data.\n\nSo with that context, I think it often makes sense to at least test a time-split approach and observe whether there's a difference with simple iid CV approach.

However, the problem is that almost every data distribution involving human interactions will tend to shift over time and contain some dependency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me give you one example: Let&amp;#39;s say we have a web app that lets users submit a picture of an animal and we predict whether it&amp;#39;s a dog or not. This seems like a simple problem where you could split by iid because there can&amp;#39;t be any data leakage, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you think about it, the distribution of photos that get submitted is likely to change over time. It could be from new dog breeds becoming more popular, or from a shift in the types of users that use the platform and the dogs they submit. It could even be due to new phones/cameras being used, or people start posing their photos slightly differently or maybe covid hits and now your service is only getting indoor photos with different lighting whereas previously you got mostly outdoor shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all hypothetical examples and you could come up with a million different ones.

I would just like to discuss a few things. I've spent about 2 months studying CNNs on coursera from the Deep Learning Specialization.

And then a few research papers that studied advanced stuff like ResNets, Inception Network, MobileNet, EfficientNet etc. Following that I studied Detection Algorithms, with a primary focus on YOLO Algorithm. I also briefly studied Regional Proposals, Semantic Segmentation, R-CNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster R-CNN, U-Net. I also learnt Face Recognition and Verification Models like Siamese Network using Triplet Loss function and Binary Classification.
