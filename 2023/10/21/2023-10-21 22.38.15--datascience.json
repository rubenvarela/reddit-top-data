Math - I don't want to end up a \"black box\" data scientist\n2. Electives/Earth Sciences -  I want a program that has plenty of opportunities for applying ES to DS\n3. Commute\n4. Other academics\n\nMy goals career-wise:\n\nI want to work on climate change and other Earth related problems (I've seen people doing some cool things with data science to track poachers, for example).  \n\n**Math**\n\nMines requires that you've taken Calc 1-3, linear algebra, and probability. \n\nCU Boulder requires that if you do not have those, you may take a couple of their online classes (which are free) that teaches the requisite math, that its, they teach the specific topics applicable to data science from Calc 1-3, lin alg, and prob so that you don't have to learn the unnecessary bits. \n\nI don't know enough about the math used in data science to know if taking all those classes the proper way is better than what CU is doing.\n\n*My math background:* I taught myself Calc 1, CLEPed out. Mines said I can teach myself Calc 2 and lin alg before starting. I will have to take Calc 3 and prob during my degree at Mines, so their 1.5 year program will actually take me 2. CU Boulder is  2 years long regardless. \n\nI know someone in the Mines MSDS program who has said that they use maybe 1 chapter from each of the Calc classes. I am good at math but that does not mean I want to sit in (and pay for) hard math classes that I will  only use 6% of.  However, I do not want to be one of these \"black box\" data scientists (though I will say that if I went to CU and found the math lacking, I could teach it to myself later). \n\nWithout being bogged down by the extra math, I think I'd have more time for electives at CU.  \n\n**Electives/Earth Science**\n\nI know that Mines is a good school and they do do some Earth science/geo but it isn't clear how much they have to offer.\n\nCU is known for their space and earth sciences. Their Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics is very well thought of and they have an initiative that supposedly leverages that expertise to address Earth's \"most pressing problems\" which I assume is climate change.\n\nCU Boulder also has this Earth Lab program/organization where they focus on using DS for climate related problems, which is a part of CIRES. CIRES is a partnership between NOAA and CU Boulder. This is the main reason why CU Boulder is so tempting. \n\n**Commute**\n\nGoing to Mines is nice because I already live in Golden (15 minute bike ride to Mines), Boulder would be about 40 min on the bus. I do not like spending so much time commuting especially after doing it for undergrad, but at least the bus is back up and running \"post\"-covid. \n\nIn conclusion, I think that CU Boulder caters more to what I want to specialize in, but I don't want to lack useful math skills and the commute is annoying. Mines, while a good school, simply doesn't have as many awe-inspiring electives, requires a lot of extra math, but has a small commute. \n\n**Other Academics** \n\nBoth schools have a similar base with Data Sci, Stat Methods and Machine Learning classes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_47lguscd", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "School of Mines vs. CU Boulder", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17d5rfl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1697903972.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, forgive me if this is not the correct sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to option to get my MS in Data Sci from either CO School of Mines or CU Boulder and it&amp;#39;s very hard for me to tell which school will best prepare me, especially mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My concerns:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Math - I don&amp;#39;t want to end up a &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; data scientist&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Electives/Earth Sciences -  I want a program that has plenty of opportunities for applying ES to DS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Commute&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other academics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goals career-wise:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to work on climate change and other Earth related problems (I&amp;#39;ve seen people doing some cool things with data science to track poachers, for example).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mines requires that you&amp;#39;ve taken Calc 1-3, linear algebra, and probability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CU Boulder requires that if you do not have those, you may take a couple of their online classes (which are free) that teaches the requisite math, that its, they teach the specific topics applicable to data science from Calc 1-3, lin alg, and prob so that you don&amp;#39;t have to learn the unnecessary bits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know enough about the math used in data science to know if taking all those classes the proper way is better than what CU is doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My math background:&lt;/em&gt; I taught myself Calc 1, CLEPed out.
