Completely incompetent, never actually did any of the subject that they were managing a team for. Ended up being fired for sexual harassment against many women on our team \n\n\n\n5. Came from another team to replace previous manager, gave me mountains of work and impossible goals and expectations to achieve, and even when achieving them, made up a bunch of excuses as to why I can't be promoted that made no sense.

However, after the first year, became very lazy as a manager. Never at their desk, always driving somewhere, scheduling meetings and then being 15 plus minutes late to them because again, they are driving somewhere, or not doing their job.

However, the problem is that almost every data distribution involving human interactions will tend to shift over time and contain some dependency.\n\nLet me give you one example: Let's say we have a web app that lets users submit a picture of an animal and we predict whether it's a dog or not. This seems like a simple problem where you could split by iid because there can't be any data leakage, right?\n\nBut if you think about it, the distribution of photos that get submitted is likely to change over time. It could be from new dog breeds becoming more popular, or from a shift in the types of users that use the platform and the dogs they submit. It could even be due to new phones/cameras being used, or people start posing their photos slightly differently or maybe covid hits and now your service is only getting indoor photos with different lighting whereas previously you got mostly outdoor shots.\n\nThese are all hypothetical examples and you could come up with a million different ones. The point being that the distribution of data for many many (most?) problems will change over time and our goal is almost always to train on historical data and predict on future unseen data.\n\nSo with that context, I think it often makes sense to at least test a time-split approach and observe whether there's a difference with simple iid CV approach.

However, the problem is that almost every data distribution involving human interactions will tend to shift over time and contain some dependency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me give you one example: Let&amp;#39;s say we have a web app that lets users submit a picture of an animal and we predict whether it&amp;#39;s a dog or not. This seems like a simple problem where you could split by iid because there can&amp;#39;t be any data leakage, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you think about it, the distribution of photos that get submitted is likely to change over time. It could be from new dog breeds becoming more popular, or from a shift in the types of users that use the platform and the dogs they submit. It could even be due to new phones/cameras being used, or people start posing their photos slightly differently or maybe covid hits and now your service is only getting indoor photos with different lighting whereas previously you got mostly outdoor shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all hypothetical examples and you could come up with a million different ones.

There are many variables that can be independently tuned, and there is a test series planned to 'qualify' the engine against its specification requirements.   \n\n\nOne of the objectives of the test series is to quantify the 'coefficient of influence' of a number of factors. Because of the number of factors involved, a full factorial DOE is out of the question, and because there are many objectives in the test series, its difficult to even design a nice, neat experimental design that follows canonical fractional factorial designs.   \n\n\nWe do have a test matrix built, and i was wondering if there is a way to just analyze what the predictive power of the current test matrix is in the first place. We know and accept that there will be some degree of confounding two-variable and three-variable + interaction effects in the main effects, which is alright for us.
