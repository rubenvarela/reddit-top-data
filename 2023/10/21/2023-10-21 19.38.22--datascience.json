I was offered what I thought was a good offer and decided to took it despite many red flags that should have alerted me.\n\nThe whole interview processed lasted 6 months with 5 different interviews. I have ask updates at some point in time but HR never answered me, only when it was to arrange next interview. I'm guessing their top picks didn't work out and I was the fallback plan.\n\nEither way, they ended up making me a very good offer financially (+30% what I was making) and despite the interview process, the manager seemed nice and the projects interesting. But that was before I actually started. On the very first week, I realized that the manager was very petty and infantilizing, not to me because I was the new guy, but to my then-colleague. I was already feeling regrets for leaving my previous job where the manager was great, but when I realized the following weeks that the projects they've been selling me were nothing close to reality.\n\nOn top of that, processes were disorganized, tools completely out of date and a real lack of proper project management (they would deploy notebook into production, no VCS, no proper database management and pipelines ...).\n\nI learned that prior to my arrival there were 3 recent departures ever since the new manager came. One dude who was about to leave kinda told me the work environment is just not it and that I was going to waste time here.\n\nThe last straw was when the manager kept reminding me that I was on probation period, I don't really know why. So after 1 month in the company, I reached back out to my previous company, got my old job back with a matching salary, and ended my probation period with the new company.\n\nThe manager was furious at first, ask me to reconsider, told me they put a lot of money in the recruiting etc ... but I was pretty determined. I don't really like trouble, so I just told him the project were not really interesting to me. I gave them 48h notice because I had barely any knowledge to pass on. On my last day, the manager asked me to join their weekly meeting on the following week (so I would have already left the company) and explain why I was leaving. He insisted that I say I was leaving on good terms so as to not discourage the team.

I was offered what I thought was a good offer and decided to took it despite many red flags that should have alerted me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole interview processed lasted 6 months with 5 different interviews. I have ask updates at some point in time but HR never answered me, only when it was to arrange next interview. I&amp;#39;m guessing their top picks didn&amp;#39;t work out and I was the fallback plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, they ended up making me a very good offer financially (+30% what I was making) and despite the interview process, the manager seemed nice and the projects interesting. But that was before I actually started. On the very first week, I realized that the manager was very petty and infantilizing, not to me because I was the new guy, but to my then-colleague. I was already feeling regrets for leaving my previous job where the manager was great, but when I realized the following weeks that the projects they&amp;#39;ve been selling me were nothing close to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, processes were disorganized, tools completely out of date and a real lack of proper project management (they would deploy notebook into production, no VCS, no proper database management and pipelines ...).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned that prior to my arrival there were 3 recent departures ever since the new manager came. One dude who was about to leave kinda told me the work environment is just not it and that I was going to waste time here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last straw was when the manager kept reminding me that I was on probation period, I don&amp;#39;t really know why. So after 1 month in the company, I reached back out to my previous company, got my old job back with a matching salary, and ended my probation period with the new company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The manager was furious at first, ask me to reconsider, told me they put a lot of money in the recruiting etc ... but I was pretty determined. I don&amp;#39;t really like trouble, so I just told him the project were not really interesting to me. I gave them 48h notice because I had barely any knowledge to pass on. On my last day, the manager asked me to join their weekly meeting on the following week (so I would have already left the company) and explain why I was leaving. He insisted that I say I was leaving on good terms so as to not discourage the team. Then he mentionned something about the world of data science being pretty small and that I should really be in this meeting. So basically he threathened me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was curious to know what are your thoughts on this. Do I even have to worry about him ?

Math - I don't want to end up a \"black box\" data scientist\n2. Electives/Earth Sciences -  I want a program that has plenty of opportunities for applying ES to DS\n3. Commute\n4. Other academics\n\nMy goals career-wise:\n\nI want to work on climate change and other Earth related problems (I've seen people doing some cool things with data science to track poachers, for example).  \n\n**Math**\n\nMines requires that you've taken Calc 1-3, linear algebra, and probability. \n\nCU Boulder requires that if you do not have those, you may take a couple of their online classes (which are free) that teaches the requisite math, that its, they teach the specific topics applicable to data science from Calc 1-3, lin alg, and prob so that you don't have to learn the unnecessary bits. \n\nI don't know enough about the math used in data science to know if taking all those classes the proper way is better than what CU is doing.\n\n*My math background:* I taught myself Calc 1, CLEPed out. Mines said I can teach myself Calc 2 and lin alg before starting. I will have to take Calc 3 and prob during my degree at Mines, so their 1.5 year program will actually take me 2. CU Boulder is  2 years long regardless. \n\nI know someone in the Mines MSDS program who has said that they use maybe 1 chapter from each of the Calc classes. I am good at math but that does not mean I want to sit in (and pay for) hard math classes that I will  only use 6% of.  However, I do not want to be one of these \"black box\" data scientists (though I will say that if I went to CU and found the math lacking, I could teach it to myself later). \n\nWithout being bogged down by the extra math, I think I'd have more time for electives at CU.  \n\n**Electives/Earth Science**\n\nI know that Mines is a good school and they do do some Earth science/geo but it isn't clear how much they have to offer.\n\nCU is known for their space and earth sciences. Their Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics is very well thought of and they have an initiative that supposedly leverages that expertise to address Earth's \"most pressing problems\" which I assume is climate change.\n\nCU Boulder also has this Earth Lab program/organization where they focus on using DS for climate related problems, which is a part of CIRES. CIRES is a partnership between NOAA and CU Boulder. This is the main reason why CU Boulder is so tempting. \n\n**Commute**\n\nGoing to Mines is nice because I already live in Golden (15 minute bike ride to Mines), Boulder would be about 40 min on the bus. I do not like spending so much time commuting especially after doing it for undergrad, but at least the bus is back up and running \"post\"-covid. \n\nIn conclusion, I think that CU Boulder caters more to what I want to specialize in, but I don't want to lack useful math skills and the commute is annoying. Mines, while a good school, simply doesn't have as many awe-inspiring electives, requires a lot of extra math, but has a small commute. \n\n**Other Academics** \n\nBoth schools have a similar base with Data Sci, Stat Methods and Machine Learning classes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_47lguscd", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "School of Mines vs. CU Boulder", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17d5rfl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1697903972.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, forgive me if this is not the correct sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to option to get my MS in Data Sci from either CO School of Mines or CU Boulder and it&amp;#39;s very hard for me to tell which school will best prepare me, especially mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My concerns:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Math - I don&amp;#39;t want to end up a &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; data scientist&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Electives/Earth Sciences -  I want a program that has plenty of opportunities for applying ES to DS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Commute&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other academics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goals career-wise:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to work on climate change and other Earth related problems (I&amp;#39;ve seen people doing some cool things with data science to track poachers, for example).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mines requires that you&amp;#39;ve taken Calc 1-3, linear algebra, and probability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CU Boulder requires that if you do not have those, you may take a couple of their online classes (which are free) that teaches the requisite math, that its, they teach the specific topics applicable to data science from Calc 1-3, lin alg, and prob so that you don&amp;#39;t have to learn the unnecessary bits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know enough about the math used in data science to know if taking all those classes the proper way is better than what CU is doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My math background:&lt;/em&gt; I taught myself Calc 1, CLEPed out.
