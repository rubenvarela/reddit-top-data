They told me it was just an introductory interview to get to know you and some of your background, walk us through your resume. So that's exactly what I did. It was an informal 30 minute call talking to them about who I was, some of my past experiences at a very high level, I asked some follow-up questions about how they use machine learning, what level experience I need in data science, analytics, SQL.... \n\n**I was rejected** and the notes the recruiter provided were \"We really wish that you had provided more information on complexity of SQL queries, types of joins that you've used, tables that you may have queried, size of the data. Mind you, this was supposed to be an introductory call just to go over the position, it wasn't even supposed to be an interview, they told me it was a meet and greet. They didn't even ask any of these questions either. Not once did they ask me to follow up question or ask me to dive deeper into anything and I simply didn't do it no, they just didn't even ask at all. That tells me one thing immediately, right off the bat. They have no respect for the people that they are interviewing, they don't care to actually get to know you or look at your background, or even give you a chance to show what you're capable of. They are just looking at all of the applicants skin deep, making them feel like they are getting a chance, and then tossing them aside and acting like it's their fault. This kind of behavior by hiring managers is extremely petty and childish. \n\n\n\n**Example of a very good hiring process I took part in**\n\n\nOne really good hiring team that I worked with and interview process that I was part of really stuck with me, and I feel like every company should treat their applicants like this. \n\n\nFirst, they started with a virtual at your own pace introductory video. Tell us about yourself, your background, you can rerecord it as many times as you want, play it back and listen to yourself. Submit it when you are ready. This was great for me because I felt like it allowed me to not only hear what I sounded like. But also present the best version of myself, and who I was, what I was passionate about. It was convenient, I didn't have to take time out of work to do this, since it's at your own pace\n\n\nSecond, in the actual interview process, they asked questions to get to know me. Whenever I provided some info about myself, if there was anything they wanted to know, or something that I didn't explain very well, they would ask me to follow up on that. Could you tell me more about this? Have you ever had to deal with any situations where you did this? Tell me about your experience with this specifically? No playing games, no BS, no guesswork. Whatever they were actually looking for, they asked specifically so you had an opportunity to tell them what it was that you could bring to the table in that specific regard\n\n\n**Finally, they cared about my extracurricular activities and projects.** This is a big one to me, because some people who learn how to code, or who are very passionate about a subject tend to practice that subject a lot outside of work, on other projects, initiatives, or recreational uses. I have an entire GitHub where I have done a lot of programming, and I mean serious projects, I'm not talking 15 lines of Java code screwing around. I'm talking about full-blown programming projects uploaded to GitHub using bash, unit testing, serving an actual purpose like performing some very complex function or task, hundreds upon hundreds of lines of code.... The company hiring for the BI engineer did not seem to care about that one bit. Irrelevant to them. They only want people that fit inside their tiny, cozy little box and aren't actually passionate about the subject.

That tells me one thing immediately, right off the bat. They have no respect for the people that they are interviewing, they don&amp;#39;t care to actually get to know you or look at your background, or even give you a chance to show what you&amp;#39;re capable of. They are just looking at all of the applicants skin deep, making them feel like they are getting a chance, and then tossing them aside and acting like it&amp;#39;s their fault. This kind of behavior by hiring managers is extremely petty and childish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of a very good hiring process I took part in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One really good hiring team that I worked with and interview process that I was part of really stuck with me, and I feel like every company should treat their applicants like this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, they started with a virtual at your own pace introductory video. Tell us about yourself, your background, you can rerecord it as many times as you want, play it back and listen to yourself. Submit it when you are ready. This was great for me because I felt like it allowed me to not only hear what I sounded like. But also present the best version of myself, and who I was, what I was passionate about. It was convenient, I didn&amp;#39;t have to take time out of work to do this, since it&amp;#39;s at your own pace&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, in the actual interview process, they asked questions to get to know me. Whenever I provided some info about myself, if there was anything they wanted to know, or something that I didn&amp;#39;t explain very well, they would ask me to follow up on that. Could you tell me more about this? Have you ever had to deal with any situations where you did this? Tell me about your experience with this specifically? No playing games, no BS, no guesswork. Whatever they were actually looking for, they asked specifically so you had an opportunity to tell them what it was that you could bring to the table in that specific regard&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, they cared about my extracurricular activities and projects.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a big one to me, because some people who learn how to code, or who are very passionate about a subject tend to practice that subject a lot outside of work, on other projects, initiatives, or recreational uses. I have an entire GitHub where I have done a lot of programming, and I mean serious projects, I&amp;#39;m not talking 15 lines of Java code screwing around. I&amp;#39;m talking about full-blown programming projects uploaded to GitHub using bash, unit testing, serving an actual purpose like performing some very complex function or task, hundreds upon hundreds of lines of code.... The company hiring for the BI engineer did not seem to care about that one bit. Irrelevant to them. They only want people that fit inside their tiny, cozy little box and aren&amp;#39;t actually passionate about the subject. Why in the world, would I want to work for a company that doesn&amp;#39;t care about their developers having passion about a subject, who only fit inside a tiny box?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17dtpbz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "databro92", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17dtpbz/why_do_some_companies_have_such_a_terrible_awful/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17dtpbz/why_do_some_companies_have_such_a_terrible_awful/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1094802, "created_utc": 1697982524.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi I'm fairly new to Data Science and I'm only now learning about MySQL.
