The case itself is all matte black painted metal except for the easy to remove plastic front panel secured by magnets to the chassis which conceals the drives.\n\nOn the front there is a single Type A USB 3.0 port, a combo headphone/audio out 3.5mm jack, and a USB C port next to the small round power switch. Eight tiny blue status LED's run along the front next to the power button. There are four circular feet on the bottom with foam at the base to support the case and keep it from sliding or vibrating.\n\nThe disks are housed in the bottom half of the chassis and the Mini ITX motherboard and PSU are mounted on the top. Four hex head bolts secure the top lid which upon removal allows the lid to be easily slid off exposing the top compartment. There is support for a dual wide full height PCIe card, and mounting provisions for two 80mm fans. There's ample room for a monstrously tall CPU cooler as well. Two 2.5\" disks can be mounted on either side of the chassis rail.\n\nCables from the case include a 20-pin USB 3.0 connector, a USB C header connector, front panel audio, and a single connector combining the power, reset, HDD status lights. There is also a cable running directly from the backplane to the front panel to accommodate the eight individual disk status lights.\n\nAs noted before, a diagonally slatted plastic panel in front is easily removable to expose the drive bays. Looking inside you can see the front face of the backplane accommodating eight SAS or SATA drives. Two 100mm x 25mm fans come with the case and are mounted on a back panel behind the hard drive bay secured by two thumb screws. It is very easy to remove the panel which exposes the back of the backplane that contains two 4-pin Molex connectors and one SATA power connector which are used to power all eight disks. Two 4-pin fan headers are also there to power the rear fans, however the fans provided are only 3-pin. And then of course the eight SATA data connectors span across the backplane.\n\n**ACCESSORIES**\n\nA couple hex tools are provided to remove the screws for the top lid. There's ample screws and insulating washers to mount the motherboard to the standoffs, eight fan screws for the two rear 80mm fan mounts, and some screws for mounting 2.5\" HDDs.\n\nThe disks don't mount by use of a traditional tray like in a QNAP or Synology NAS. Instead they provide a bunch of flat headed philips shoulder screws which mount to the hard drives through circular rubber grommets allowing them to slide into the case rail. There are rubber straps that mount to the back of the drives for something to grab onto when removing the disks.\n\n**BUILDING IN THE CASE**\n\nBuilding components in the case is pretty simple. Removal of the top lid gives full easy access install the motherboard with no issues. There are tiedown provisions for wiring in the motherboard bay, and a large opening to snake power and data cables down to the backplane.\n\nThe biggest issue is with the power supply. A power plug already exists in the back of the case which routes through a cable to plug into your SFX PSU mounted internally in the case (similar to the Fractal Design Node 304 if you're familiar with that one). I'm not a big fan of that design because then you don't have access to a switch to power off the PSU, you have to pull the power plug.\n\nAdditionally in order to install the PSU, you need to remove a bracket to mount to the PSU then mount the PSU with the bracket to the case. However, in order to remove the bracket you need a long shaft Philips head screwdriver with a shaft at least about 140mm long.\n\nAn LSI 9211-8i HBA was used to control the disks through the backplane.\n\nI was able to build up a case with decent wire management in about 30 minutes.\n\n**HARD DRIVE COOLING**\n\nI mounted three sets of disks in this case and used OpenMediaVault to manage the disks:\n\n* 8x Seagate Barracuda SATA ST2000DM001 2TB (CMR) in RAID 6\n* 4x HGST SAS 4TB (CMR) in RAID 5\n* 5x 12TB Western Digital White + 3x 14TB Western Digital White (CMR) in RAID 6\n\nThe two rear fans provided by Jonsbo to cool the hard drive bay have Jonsbo labelling on them. I didn't find any other labels to see if it was manufactured by some third party and didn't recognize them otherwise either.\n\nI did test each of the above three configurations with the fans run at two speeds:\n\n* One at max 12V speed as connected to the backplane headers would only provide it\n* Connected to the motherboard at a lower fan speed (8.8V) adjusted through the BIOS\n\nRemember these are 3-pin DC voltage controlled fans, there is no PWM.\n\nIn each situation I wrote a simple script to record the drive temps in two situations:\n\n* a three hour timespan while idle (near 0% utilization)\n* six hour timespan while building the RAID arrays (near 100% utilization)\n\nAmbient room temperature is about 24C.\n\nResults from these tests are as follows:\n\n    High Fan Speed Disk Temperature (deg C):\n    8x 2TB RAID 6 IDLE:         29 to 32\n    8x 2TB RAID 6 RAID 6 BUILD: 31 to 34\n    4x HGST SAS RAID 5 BUILD:   37 to 38\n    8x 12TB WD RAID 6 IDLE:     35 to 40\n    8x 12TB WD RAID 6 BUILD:    35 to 41\n    \n    Low (8.8V) Fan Speed Disk Temperature (deg C):\n    8x 2TB RAID 6 IDLE:         31 to 35\n    8x 2TB RAID 6 RAID 6 BUILD: 33 to 38\n    8x 12TB WD RAID 6 IDLE:     35 to 40\n    8x 12TB WD RAID 6 BUILD:    35 to 41\n\n**FAN NOISE**\n\nNoise measurements were also taken (values in dB):\n\n    Ambient:               40.5\n    Low Fan No HDD:        42.6\n    Low Fan 8x  2TB Idle:  43.2\n    Low Fan 8x 12TB Idle:  47.9\n    High Fan No HDD:       45.1\n    High Fan 8x  2TB Idle: 46.4\n    High Fan 8x 12TB Idle: 48.3\n\n**ASSESSMENT**\n\nSo a few things we can glean from this data:\n\n* SAS disks are supported\n* The noise levels between low fan speed and max fan speed are fairly negligible\n* The fans are more than adequate to cool eight high capacity HDD's during high utilization scenarios\n\nThe fan noise is also a low tone whoosh, no different from other PC fans I have running in the room.\n\nAdditionally, 8x Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5\" SATA SSD's were installed just to ensure the backplane was functioning properly up to SATA III (600 MB/sec) speeds, or minimally not gimped to SATA II speeds for some reason (I've seen that in some cases). The sustained 1GB read speed maintained approximately 500 MB/sec for each SSD, well exceeding the 300 MB/sec SATA II threshold, so it seems to be fine.\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n* Good fit and finish overall, solid build with no noticeable buzzes or rattles while in use.\n* Easy to build in with exception of PSU bracket requires long Philips head shaft screwdriver to remove.\n* Ample clearance for large CPU cooler and full height dual width PCIe card.\n* Included 100mm fans provide adequate hdd cooling at reasonable sound levels, keeps large capacity disks under 40C at load.\n* Disks are super easy to access and fit snugly.\n* Front panel pins are in a singular connector.\n* SAS disks supported, with proper HBA card support.\n\nWhat could be improved/changed, mainly questionable design decisions, otherwise a solid case:\n\n* Change cover screws from hex to Philips. Hex tools aren\u2019t as common.\n* Doesn\u2019t need to be so tall, half height cards are fine and probably no massive CPU or cooler needed.\n* Mini ITX limits to single PCIe slot. Most Mini ITX boards don\u2019t have more than 4 SATA ports so PCIe card required. Can\u2019t install faster network card like a 10G then.\n* I\u2019d rather see 2-3 inch wider to support Micro ATX with PSU to the side of the drive bays, and chop a couple inches off the height. A more squat form factor would look nicer IMHO.\n* USB C connector is not supported on many motherboards. Would rather see two USB type A ports than one A and one C.\n* Not a fan of the internal power plug. No way to manually switch off power without pulling plug or removing cover.\n\nYou can see my video review here: https://youtu.be/3tCIAE_luFY?si=xBB22Mtaf2QtxJDD\n\nedit: grammar, clarification.", "author_fullname": "t2_fzwj4", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Jonsbo N3 8 Bay NAS Case Quick Review", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17eatg6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "e34ee8aa-b988-11e2-9fc1-12313d18884c", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 43, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1698033544.0, "author_flair_css_class": "hd", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1698030763.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jonsbo N3 is a fairly new NAS case offering that released sometime 23H2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Images Here: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/MPgqI5F\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/MPgqI5F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is an 8 bay hot swap &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot; NAS case that accommodates Mini ITX motherboards and requires an SFX PSU. The case itself is all matte black painted metal except for the easy to remove plastic front panel secured by magnets to the chassis which conceals the drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the front there is a single Type A USB 3.0 port, a combo headphone/audio out 3.5mm jack, and a USB C port next to the small round power switch. Eight tiny blue status LED&amp;#39;s run along the front next to the power button. There are four circular feet on the bottom with foam at the base to support the case and keep it from sliding or vibrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The disks are housed in the bottom half of the chassis and the Mini ITX motherboard and PSU are mounted on the top. Four hex head bolts secure the top lid which upon removal allows the lid to be easily slid off exposing the top compartment. There is support for a dual wide full height PCIe card, and mounting provisions for two 80mm fans. There&amp;#39;s ample room for a monstrously tall CPU cooler as well. Two 2.5&amp;quot; disks can be mounted on either side of the chassis rail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cables from the case include a 20-pin USB 3.0 connector, a USB C header connector, front panel audio, and a single connector combining the power, reset, HDD status lights. There is also a cable running directly from the backplane to the front panel to accommodate the eight individual disk status lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As noted before, a diagonally slatted plastic panel in front is easily removable to expose the drive bays. Looking inside you can see the front face of the backplane accommodating eight SAS or SATA drives. Two 100mm x 25mm fans come with the case and are mounted on a back panel behind the hard drive bay secured by two thumb screws. It is very easy to remove the panel which exposes the back of the backplane that contains two 4-pin Molex connectors and one SATA power connector which are used to power all eight disks. Two 4-pin fan headers are also there to power the rear fans, however the fans provided are only 3-pin. And then of course the eight SATA data connectors span across the backplane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCESSORIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple hex tools are provided to remove the screws for the top lid. There&amp;#39;s ample screws and insulating washers to mount the motherboard to the standoffs, eight fan screws for the two rear 80mm fan mounts, and some screws for mounting 2.5&amp;quot; HDDs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The disks don&amp;#39;t mount by use of a traditional tray like in a QNAP or Synology NAS. Instead they provide a bunch of flat headed philips shoulder screws which mount to the hard drives through circular rubber grommets allowing them to slide into the case rail. There are rubber straps that mount to the back of the drives for something to grab onto when removing the disks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUILDING IN THE CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Building components in the case is pretty simple. Removal of the top lid gives full easy access install the motherboard with no issues. There are tiedown provisions for wiring in the motherboard bay, and a large opening to snake power and data cables down to the backplane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue is with the power supply. A power plug already exists in the back of the case which routes through a cable to plug into your SFX PSU mounted internally in the case (similar to the Fractal Design Node 304 if you&amp;#39;re familiar with that one). I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of that design because then you don&amp;#39;t have access to a switch to power off the PSU, you have to pull the power plug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally in order to install the PSU, you need to remove a bracket to mount to the PSU then mount the PSU with the bracket to the case. However, in order to remove the bracket you need a long shaft Philips head screwdriver with a shaft at least about 140mm long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An LSI 9211-8i HBA was used to control the disks through the backplane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to build up a case with decent wire management in about 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARD DRIVE COOLING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mounted three sets of disks in this case and used OpenMediaVault to manage the disks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;8x Seagate Barracuda SATA ST2000DM001 2TB (CMR) in RAID 6&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4x HGST SAS 4TB (CMR) in RAID 5&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5x 12TB Western Digital White + 3x 14TB Western Digital White (CMR) in RAID 6&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two rear fans provided by Jonsbo to cool the hard drive bay have Jonsbo labelling on them. I didn&amp;#39;t find any other labels to see if it was manufactured by some third party and didn&amp;#39;t recognize them otherwise either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did test each of the above three configurations with the fans run at two speeds:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One at max 12V speed as connected to the backplane headers would only provide it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Connected to the motherboard at a lower fan speed (8.8V) adjusted through the BIOS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember these are 3-pin DC voltage controlled fans, there is no PWM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In each situation I wrote a simple script to record the drive temps in two situations:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a three hour timespan while idle (near 0% utilization)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;six hour timespan while building the RAID arrays (near 100% utilization)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ambient room temperature is about 24C.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results from these tests are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;High Fan Speed Disk Temperature (deg C):\n8x 2TB RAID 6 IDLE:         29 to 32\n8x 2TB RAID 6 RAID 6 BUILD: 31 to 34\n4x HGST SAS RAID 5 BUILD:   37 to 38\n8x 12TB WD RAID 6 IDLE:     35 to 40\n8x 12TB WD RAID 6 BUILD:    35 to 41\n\nLow (8.8V) Fan Speed Disk Temperature (deg C):\n8x 2TB RAID 6 IDLE:         31 to 35\n8x 2TB RAID 6 RAID 6 BUILD: 33 to 38\n8x 12TB WD RAID 6 IDLE:     35 to 40\n8x 12TB WD RAID 6 BUILD:    35 to 41\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAN NOISE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noise measurements were also taken (values in dB):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ambient:               40.5\nLow Fan No HDD:        42.6\nLow Fan 8x  2TB Idle:  43.2\nLow Fan 8x 12TB Idle:  47.9\nHigh Fan No HDD:       45.1\nHigh Fan 8x  2TB Idle: 46.4\nHigh Fan 8x 12TB Idle: 48.3\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASSESSMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a few things we can glean from this data:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SAS disks are supported&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The noise levels between low fan speed and max fan speed are fairly negligible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The fans are more than adequate to cool eight high capacity HDD&amp;#39;s during high utilization scenarios&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fan noise is also a low tone whoosh, no different from other PC fans I have running in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 8x Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5&amp;quot; SATA SSD&amp;#39;s were installed just to ensure the backplane was functioning properly up to SATA III (600 MB/sec) speeds, or minimally not gimped to SATA II speeds for some reason (I&amp;#39;ve seen that in some cases).

In the past, I did backups in this manner:\n\n* Inside the home server, there were two HDDs - a main one, and a backup one. I manually ran rsync every now and then to copy over data to the backup drive.\n* Additionally, there were two HDDs in external 3.5\" drive enclosures. One of them I placed off-site. That way, at some point, I copied over data from the backup drive with rsync to the external drive that I had at home, and then went to the off-site location to swap external drives.\n\nI am now upgrading the drives and Debian itself, and as part of that, I also want a smarter backup solution. I think I'll keep the rsync based approach for the external drives, since these I always run manually anyway. And that way, I can always fully access the data - I am not risking data loss due to corruption in some backup tool specific archives / images / snapshots. I think it is a good idea to not use the same backup tool and format for _all_ drives. If there's corruption due to a backup tool bug, then at least the external drives can still be accessed, and data loss is migitated.\n\nAlso, I use btrfs on all drives mainly for its checksum feature, on top of LUKS.\n\nWhat I want to specifically change is what I do with the internal backup drive. For *that* I want to move towards an automated solution with versioning.\n\nHowever, there are three questions that I haven't found answers to yet.\n\nFirst, in the past, I rsync'd the contents of the _backup_ drive to external drives, and not the contents of the main drive. The reason for that was that I wanted to offload some of the IO load. The main drive is getting used the most of all of the drives already. By first rsync'ing the main drive contents to the internal backup drive, and then from the internal backup drive to the external drive, I hoped to reduce IO on the main disk (since the internal drives are closer in sync than an internal and an external drive are). If I use an actual backup tool, this means that I somehow have to rsync the contents of the backup tool specific archive/image/snapshot. I suppose one way to do that would be to be able to mount the archive/image/snapshot in Linux?\n\nSecond, it seems to me that relying on LUKS to do the encryption is more secure and robust since LUKS is much more tested than any custom made encryption by a backup tool. Would you agree?\n\nThird, I am still researching what backup tool is best suited for me. I do not need any cloud backup support, or anything that isn't local for that matter. As said, off-site backups I do by transporting the physical external disk anyway. My constraints are (a) reliability and (b) resource consumption. For (a), if there is corruption in the archive/image/snapshot, it must not cause total loss of the backup. For (b), I use a Supermicro mainboard with an Intel Atom C3558, and the machine has 16 GB ECC RAM. I do not want a backup solution that is extremely RAM hungry. I have about 10 TB of data and &gt; 4 million files.\n\nTo summarize what I do _not_ need:\n* Compression\n* Encryption (unless it really is better to use backup tool based encrypting instead of relying on LUKS)\n* Cloud storage support\n* Ability to use the same archive to backup data from multiple computers\n* Anything related to commercial licenses (this is for private use only)\n* Windows support (I only use Linux)\n\nThe main tools I found and looked at thus far:\n\n## Restic\n\nPro: Versioned snapshots, very popular, good performance.\n\nCon: Apparently, very high resource consumption with large datasets (see for example [here](https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-uses-more-than-4gb-ram-on-14gb-backup-than-crashes/4584), [here](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2519), or [here](https://forum.restic.net/t/high-memory-usage-on-backup-prune-and-check/1253)). This seems to be mainly caused by Go's garbage collector, which needs finetuning (see the `GOGC=20` recommendatins).\n\nWith regards to reliability, I found [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16rnnji/comment/k26i0p5/) about data corruption, but this seems to have been caused by RAM corruption. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/f40fa2/restic_alternative_for_backups/) is more worrisome, but it is also 4 years old. Same applies to [this one](https://forum.restic.net/t/recovery-options-for-damaged-repositories/1571). [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/169tawo/comment/jz3ss6e/) claims that Restic does not have bit rot protection, but according to [this](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1620), Restic does use SHA256 and stores the checksum in blob filenames.\n\n## Borg\n\nPro: Versioned snapshots, also very popular, seems very mature. Did not find any RAM usage issues. Well established ecosystem from what I've seen.\n\nCon: Unclear about performance. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/izq0mo/comment/g9jmqak/) claims that larger datasets like mine would cause Borg to be very slow - but, it is 3 years old.\n\nAlso, I am not sure about a Python based solution. It does come with a large amounts of Python library dependencies, and I am typically skeptical about using a dynamically typed language for software that must be rock solid and highly reliable. But Borg has been around for a long time, so I am less worried about bugs.\n\n## Duplicacy\n\nPro: No need for a special index database. The chunks are placed in the file system. [This](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Lock-Free-Deduplication) explains it in greater detail. Seems to place great emphasis on reliability, which is important for me. Versioning is also supported.\n\nCon: Apparently, much less popular than Restic or Borg - I had a harder time researching about experiences others have had with it. And, similar to Restic, RAM usage seems to be potentially a problem. I found [this post](https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/memory-usage/623) that states: \"The memory usage is highly related to the number of files to be backed up. Duplicacy loads the entire file list into the memory during the indexing phase so you may run out of memory if there are too many files.\" With &gt;4 million files, this worries me. But, this is an old post. [This post](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/3401965/#Comment_3401965) also reports high RAM usage, but indicates that my file count could be handled with 16 GB RAM.\n\nI also briefly looked at Kopia. Overall quite interesting, with very good performance, but I am unsure about its reliability.

In the past, I did backups in this manner:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inside the home server, there were two HDDs - a main one, and a backup one. I manually ran rsync every now and then to copy over data to the backup drive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Additionally, there were two HDDs in external 3.5&amp;quot; drive enclosures. One of them I placed off-site. That way, at some point, I copied over data from the backup drive with rsync to the external drive that I had at home, and then went to the off-site location to swap external drives.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now upgrading the drives and Debian itself, and as part of that, I also want a smarter backup solution. I think I&amp;#39;ll keep the rsync based approach for the external drives, since these I always run manually anyway. And that way, I can always fully access the data - I am not risking data loss due to corruption in some backup tool specific archives / images / snapshots. I think it is a good idea to not use the same backup tool and format for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; drives. If there&amp;#39;s corruption due to a backup tool bug, then at least the external drives can still be accessed, and data loss is migitated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I use btrfs on all drives mainly for its checksum feature, on top of LUKS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I want to specifically change is what I do with the internal backup drive. For &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; I want to move towards an automated solution with versioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there are three questions that I haven&amp;#39;t found answers to yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, in the past, I rsync&amp;#39;d the contents of the &lt;em&gt;backup&lt;/em&gt; drive to external drives, and not the contents of the main drive. The reason for that was that I wanted to offload some of the IO load. The main drive is getting used the most of all of the drives already. By first rsync&amp;#39;ing the main drive contents to the internal backup drive, and then from the internal backup drive to the external drive, I hoped to reduce IO on the main disk (since the internal drives are closer in sync than an internal and an external drive are). If I use an actual backup tool, this means that I somehow have to rsync the contents of the backup tool specific archive/image/snapshot. I suppose one way to do that would be to be able to mount the archive/image/snapshot in Linux?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, it seems to me that relying on LUKS to do the encryption is more secure and robust since LUKS is much more tested than any custom made encryption by a backup tool. Would you agree?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, I am still researching what backup tool is best suited for me. I do not need any cloud backup support, or anything that isn&amp;#39;t local for that matter. As said, off-site backups I do by transporting the physical external disk anyway. My constraints are (a) reliability and (b) resource consumption. For (a), if there is corruption in the archive/image/snapshot, it must not cause total loss of the backup. For (b), I use a Supermicro mainboard with an Intel Atom C3558, and the machine has 16 GB ECC RAM. I do not want a backup solution that is extremely RAM hungry. I have about 10 TB of data and &amp;gt; 4 million files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To summarize what I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need:\n* Compression\n* Encryption (unless it really is better to use backup tool based encrypting instead of relying on LUKS)\n* Cloud storage support\n* Ability to use the same archive to backup data from multiple computers\n* Anything related to commercial licenses (this is for private use only)\n* Windows support (I only use Linux)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main tools I found and looked at thus far:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Restic&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pro: Versioned snapshots, very popular, good performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Con: Apparently, very high resource consumption with large datasets (see for example &lt;a href=\"https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-uses-more-than-4gb-ram-on-14gb-backup-than-crashes/4584\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2519\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"https://forum.restic.net/t/high-memory-usage-on-backup-prune-and-check/1253\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). This seems to be mainly caused by Go&amp;#39;s garbage collector, which needs finetuning (see the &lt;code&gt;GOGC=20&lt;/code&gt; recommendatins).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With regards to reliability, I found &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16rnnji/comment/k26i0p5/\"&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; about data corruption, but this seems to have been caused by RAM corruption. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/f40fa2/restic_alternative_for_backups/\"&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; is more worrisome, but it is also 4 years old. Same applies to &lt;a href=\"https://forum.restic.net/t/recovery-options-for-damaged-repositories/1571\"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/169tawo/comment/jz3ss6e/\"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; claims that Restic does not have bit rot protection, but according to &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1620\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, Restic does use SHA256 and stores the checksum in blob filenames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Borg&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pro: Versioned snapshots, also very popular, seems very mature. Did not find any RAM usage issues. Well established ecosystem from what I&amp;#39;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Con: Unclear about performance. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/izq0mo/comment/g9jmqak/\"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; claims that larger datasets like mine would cause Borg to be very slow - but, it is 3 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I am not sure about a Python based solution. It does come with a large amounts of Python library dependencies, and I am typically skeptical about using a dynamically typed language for software that must be rock solid and highly reliable. But Borg has been around for a long time, so I am less worried about bugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Duplicacy&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pro: No need for a special index database. The chunks are placed in the file system. &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Lock-Free-Deduplication\"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; explains it in greater detail. Seems to place great emphasis on reliability, which is important for me. Versioning is also supported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Con: Apparently, much less popular than Restic or Borg - I had a harder time researching about experiences others have had with it. And, similar to Restic, RAM usage seems to be potentially a problem. I found &lt;a href=\"https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/memory-usage/623\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that states: &amp;quot;The memory usage is highly related to the number of files to be backed up. Duplicacy loads the entire file list into the memory during the indexing phase so you may run out of memory if there are too many files.&amp;quot; With &amp;gt;4 million files, this worries me. But, this is an old post. &lt;a href=\"https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/3401965/#Comment_3401965\"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; also reports high RAM usage, but indicates that my file count could be handled with 16 GB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also briefly looked at Kopia. Overall quite interesting, with very good performance, but I am unsure about its reliability. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/tz0ad6/kopia_vs_borg/\"&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; (which admittely is 2 years old) did not inspire confidence. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16rnnji/comment/k24e70x/\"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; however is much more recent, and also rather alarming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus far, my favorite is Duplicacy due to it not needing a special index database and putting such emphasis on reliability.

for cold storage and finished projects that have moved from my SSDs (once I am done editing) in the Apple/Mac ecosystem. I am wondering if a more experienced data hoarder ninja like some of you are here can shed light on the difference between true SMART scan software and DiskWarrior. \n\nI own both Disk Warrior and DriveDX  and have had very good success with DiskWarrior on a few times when things would be problematic or not mount from a traditional Mac Disk Utility rebuild. I am now buying more naked SATA 3.5\" drives for cold storage (offsite backup in antistatic cases) of footage and it seems like a SMART scan is pretty industry standard for a drive that comes in the mail and I haven't begun loading yet, but Disk Warrior simply gives a basic analysis of \"Directory Optimization Index\" (which is generated quite quickly compared to a SMART test) and prompts a Rebuild.\n\nI guess my question is, what combination of software and process do you like to use most when analyzing new drives added to your inventory as well as maintaining two copies of content across traditional SATA drives when using software such as these?

I am wondering if a more experienced data hoarder ninja like some of you are here can shed light on the difference between true SMART scan software and DiskWarrior. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I own both Disk Warrior and DriveDX  and have had very good success with DiskWarrior on a few times when things would be problematic or not mount from a traditional Mac Disk Utility rebuild.

I know there are other brands and more expensive choices, and also DL. But my question concerns only those BD-Rs mentioned.\n\nAsking about how long these discs last is not something that can be known fully, since the conditions of how they are stored (what CD packages? are they subjected to sudden temperature changes? On top of each other? And so on), influence how much time they'll last.\n\nStill, assuming the discs are not subject to bad choices during storage, let's check what this quick article says:\n\n[https://www.techjunkie.com/how-long-does-backup-media-last/](https://www.techjunkie.com/how-long-does-backup-media-last/)\n\n*Premium-grade media can easily last 10 years. And no, you won\u2019t find it at Wal-Mart. The best possible writable CD/DVD media you can buy is manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. A Google search will reveal where to get some if so inclined. It is lauded as the best of the best. That\u2019s because it is. And yes, you\u2019ll pay good money for it too.*\n\n*For the rest of us, there\u2019s name brand and generic optical media. You can expect name brand (Memorex, Verbatim, etc.) to last about 5 years. Some of you out there will get 7 to 10 but I personally wouldn\u2019t put that much faith into this type of media.*\n\n*Concerning generic, the plastic may separate from the aluminum in less than a year. Not a good choice.*\n\n*With optical media, yes, you get what you pay for concerning life span. No question.*\n\nI think what he's trying to say is that it should last AT LEAST 5-10 years, still if kept alone and well preserved, these discs don't start rotting all of sudden and may perhaps be readable 20 years from now. Even CDs which were said to not be reliable, after being opened many years later, most of them were working.\n\nWhat I am interested in knowing (and this is the right subreddit to ask...) is if BD-Rs may be 100% fine now (and I always \"verify after burning\" with CDBurnerXP...) and in a few years may present some issue even if rarely used.\n\nBecause it's not just a scratch or the package itself that can corrupt the data, it was explained that with discs, there is some chemical deterioration, oxidation of the reflective layer.

I know there are other brands and more expensive choices, and also DL. But my question concerns only those BD-Rs mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asking about how long these discs last is not something that can be known fully, since the conditions of how they are stored (what CD packages? are they subjected to sudden temperature changes? On top of each other? And so on), influence how much time they&amp;#39;ll last.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, assuming the discs are not subject to bad choices during storage, let&amp;#39;s check what this quick article says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.techjunkie.com/how-long-does-backup-media-last/\"&gt;https://www.techjunkie.com/how-long-does-backup-media-last/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Premium-grade media can easily last 10 years. And no, you won\u2019t find it at Wal-Mart. The best possible writable CD/DVD media you can buy is manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. A Google search will reveal where to get some if so inclined. It is lauded as the best of the best. That\u2019s because it is. And yes, you\u2019ll pay good money for it too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the rest of us, there\u2019s name brand and generic optical media. You can expect name brand (Memorex, Verbatim, etc.) to last about 5 years. Some of you out there will get 7 to 10 but I personally wouldn\u2019t put that much faith into this type of media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerning generic, the plastic may separate from the aluminum in less than a year. Not a good choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With optical media, yes, you get what you pay for concerning life span. No question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think what he&amp;#39;s trying to say is that it should last AT LEAST 5-10 years, still if kept alone and well preserved, these discs don&amp;#39;t start rotting all of sudden and may perhaps be readable 20 years from now. Even CDs which were said to not be reliable, after being opened many years later, most of them were working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I am interested in knowing (and this is the right subreddit to ask...) is if BD-Rs may be 100% fine now (and I always &amp;quot;verify after burning&amp;quot; with CDBurnerXP...) and in a few years may present some issue even if rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s not just a scratch or the package itself that can corrupt the data, it was explained that with discs, there is some chemical deterioration, oxidation of the reflective layer. I guess the thing starts dissolving, regardless of the buyer&amp;#39;s collaboration, like in the case of people that brings to their cars, subjected to hot climates, or using too often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, cases when this happens and the disc was kept inside a box and not facing harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is another article that touches on this point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blog.ligos.net/2022-04-02/The-Reliability-Of-Optical-Disks.html\"&gt;https://blog.ligos.net/2022-04-02/The-Reliability-Of-Optical-Disks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this one that author ends up agreeing optical media (Blu-rays) are the best for offline/cold storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blog.ligos.net/tags/Archiving-Series/\"&gt;https://blog.ligos.net/tags/Archiving-Series/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was willing to invest in BD-RE at first, then BD-R now, but I am really interested in knowing if spending on this would be a waste of time in 5-10 years.

However my PC just doesn't work anymore. The moment  I try to copy something onto raid5 or access something everything freezes and whole PC becomes sluggish.When copying something onto raid5 it starts at about 500MB/s transfer rates and after 10 seconds it drops speeds down to 250KB/s to max 4MB/s. That's also when PC gets sluggish, everything stops responding and just takes forever to load.\n\nIt's an older system with i7-2600k but CPU doesn't get over 10% utilisation, 32GB of ram, again only like 30% used. SSD is at 1% (where im copying from), raid5 HDD is pinned at 100%. The issue stays even after everything is finished copying. Disk stays at 100% for hours and even if I try to shutdown or restart PC, the PC is frozen on \"restarting\" or \"shutting down\" for that period of time. If I leave the PC idle, the raid5 eventually drops to 0% and I can use PC normaly again.\n\nI've been searching internet and reddit for a few days now without any results of a problem like this.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbey7hu2oyvb1.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef5c0e8eff8b7122ff0945fafcbf9b89dadf4b3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkzu4au2oyvb1.png?width=871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42f595a246aa1a507491929b4d82449e57d0ea4f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzi2pbu2oyvb1.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90ea9cd105fb6322f415b7c93bf1f513d718795b",

moved the raid5 in my personal pc. The raid5 worked flawlesly in 2nd pc however in my personal PC I am having tons of issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All 3 drives have about 2900 power on hours, they all pass all tests I&amp;#39;ve done and they don&amp;#39;t make any weird noise. However my PC just doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore. The moment  I try to copy something onto raid5 or access something everything freezes and whole PC becomes sluggish.When copying something onto raid5 it starts at about 500MB/s transfer rates and after 10 seconds it drops speeds down to 250KB/s to max 4MB/s. That&amp;#39;s also when PC gets sluggish, everything stops responding and just takes forever to load.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an older system with i7-2600k but CPU doesn&amp;#39;t get over 10% utilisation, 32GB of ram, again only like 30% used. SSD is at 1% (where im copying from), raid5 HDD is pinned at 100%. The issue stays even after everything is finished copying. Disk stays at 100% for hours and even if I try to shutdown or restart PC, the PC is frozen on &amp;quot;restarting&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;shutting down&amp;quot; for that period of time. If I leave the PC idle, the raid5 eventually drops to 0% and I can use PC normaly again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been searching internet and reddit for a few days now without any results of a problem like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cbey7hu2oyvb1.png?width=1339&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8ef5c0e8eff8b7122ff0945fafcbf9b89dadf4b3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cbey7hu2oyvb1.png?width=1339&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8ef5c0e8eff8b7122ff0945fafcbf9b89dadf4b3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jkzu4au2oyvb1.png?width=871&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42f595a246aa1a507491929b4d82449e57d0ea4f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jkzu4au2oyvb1.png?width=871&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42f595a246aa1a507491929b4d82449e57d0ea4f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tzi2pbu2oyvb1.png?width=674&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=90ea9cd105fb6322f415b7c93bf1f513d718795b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tzi2pbu2oyvb1.png?width=674&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=90ea9cd105fb6322f415b7c93bf1f513d718795b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5b6d7a04-b94e-11eb-b676-0ed4dfcb172d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17eljj1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Don_Lenkas", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17eljj1/raid5_issues_with_pc/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17eljj1/raid5_issues_with_pc/", "subreddit_subscribers": 708201, "created_utc": 1698070839.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Greetings,\n\nAfter my last 7 years old HDD died (vibrations from living right above the metro in Milan for some months are the main suspect tbh) I moved to SSDs, not much for speed, but majorly for supposedly higher reliability; for the last 2 years my system was entirely reliant on SSDs, with just one hard drive for a second copy of important data.

My best network share uses drivepool to tier storage as 500gb nvme &gt; 500gb SSD &gt; 3x5tb SMR in raid 5.\n\nTrueNas seems really cool but not an option due to mix of drives and slow capacity upgrade plans, and at least from what I can tell, unraid doesn't have the ability to do tiered storage like I want, or fundamentally doesn't need it? I've been diving into a whole lot of research about it and it's all still a bit of a mess.\n\nEssentially what I was hoping for is to have all 12 spinners in a singe parity array, and upgrade that to dual parity as I can afford more 8tb drives, with another array of 4x2tb or 4x4tb 2.5\" SSD's as an SSD tier in single parity as well, and I was hoping that unraid would be able to promote frequently accessed data onto the SSD's for faster access over 10 gig.\n\nBut, it seems windows storage spaces is the only solution that heatmaps data, tracks when it was accessed and shuffles it around? I was hoping to do something other than windows server as a change this time around, and maybe the mover plugin can kind of help but it seems like it would be more a manual thing?\n\nIt sounds like from what I've read, L2ARC won't act quite like how I want, if I open up a months p;d project with 500gb-1tb of raw video files to edit it, it doesn't sound like L2ARC can actually handle that or many large files in general and it will still run off the spinnersl? Correct me if I'm wrong because that would be great\n\nThe other downside to L@ARC is it's invisible, you don't actually get that capacity, since it's only a cache and not tiered storage. The other option would just be two network shares, one SSD and one spinners, which would work, but doesn't have the magic automatic data shuffling that I think would be really cool and useful. That being said, with 12 3.5\" platters, I should be able to saturate 10 gig with fairly large files, but just not as great performance with smaller stuff.\n\nI'm still on the fence, I might just have this machine fired up when I'm working with my cinema camera footage and video projects, turning it off when not needed to save power, that was the original plan, but maybe starting to fully move over from my old solution, then hopefully in several months I can replace the dl380 g6 with something newer/more power efficient, with gpu capability.\n\nSo....

I&amp;#39;ve been diving into a whole lot of research about it and it&amp;#39;s all still a bit of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially what I was hoping for is to have all 12 spinners in a singe parity array, and upgrade that to dual parity as I can afford more 8tb drives, with another array of 4x2tb or 4x4tb 2.5&amp;quot; SSD&amp;#39;s as an SSD tier in single parity as well, and I was hoping that unraid would be able to promote frequently accessed data onto the SSD&amp;#39;s for faster access over 10 gig.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, it seems windows storage spaces is the only solution that heatmaps data, tracks when it was accessed and shuffles it around? I was hoping to do something other than windows server as a change this time around, and maybe the mover plugin can kind of help but it seems like it would be more a manual thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like from what I&amp;#39;ve read, L2ARC won&amp;#39;t act quite like how I want, if I open up a months p;d project with 500gb-1tb of raw video files to edit it, it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like L2ARC can actually handle that or many large files in general and it will still run off the spinnersl? Correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong because that would be great&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other downside to L@ARC is it&amp;#39;s invisible, you don&amp;#39;t actually get that capacity, since it&amp;#39;s only a cache and not tiered storage. The other option would just be two network shares, one SSD and one spinners, which would work, but doesn&amp;#39;t have the magic automatic data shuffling that I think would be really cool and useful. That being said, with 12 3.5&amp;quot; platters, I should be able to saturate 10 gig with fairly large files, but just not as great performance with smaller stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still on the fence, I might just have this machine fired up when I&amp;#39;m working with my cinema camera footage and video projects, turning it off when not needed to save power, that was the original plan, but maybe starting to fully move over from my old solution, then hopefully in several months I can replace the dl380 g6 with something newer/more power efficient, with gpu capability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So.... I need some help making my mind up and I guess my efforts to keep this short didn&amp;#39;t really work :/&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "My backups are on floppies.", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17emxcr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "XOIIO", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17emxcr/unraidstorage_spaces_tiered_storage_is_windows/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17emxcr/unraidstorage_spaces_tiered_storage_is_windows/", "subreddit_subscribers": 708201, "created_utc": 1698074452.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
