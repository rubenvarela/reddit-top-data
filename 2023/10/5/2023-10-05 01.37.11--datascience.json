To preface, I started a new job almost a year ago, I graduated with my MBA last year, and I had 2 years of experience as a data analyst prior. \n\nWhen I started my job, I was very excited because of all the glamor and hype that comes along with a space program, but that excitement is gone. My company is a start up, and everyone in my sector has started within the last year or two. A few months in, I realized how poor of processes this company had, if any, along with an evident lack of leadership. We had a major re-organization that left many people without jobs, and on top of that, we let go close to a third of our employees at the same time. We have had drastic funding issues and schedule issues because of that, so overall, the mood has not been good. Additionally, I was put on a \u201cneed to know\u201d program that will potentially take the company down an ethical path that I am not willing to go down. \n\nI kept holding on thinking that maybe just maybe things would get better, but I also had family health issues that required me to leave the state permanently right as my company put in a mandatory work from office policy.  \n\nWith all this being said, I was offered a very nice position at another company that would be a 15% increase in pay in the state I was moving to, but the position was one that I knew that I would be unfulfilled and very unhappy doing. Regardless, I decided that the stability and being able to move for my family was more important than the role, so I turned in my notice at my current job and prepared to take this new one. \n\nOur sector VP, however, made a counter offer for me to stay with the company remote, and they would not only match the opposing company but give me yet an additional 7% raise and a promotion and a sizeable bonus to move. I naively accepted the offer but with the catch that if I left within 12 months, I would have to pay back that bonus in full. \n\nFast forward, things have only gotten worse at this company, and the ethical concern is seeming to become a reality.  I am also in a bad situation in that I am not qualified to be in the promotion I was given, or at least I am not getting the support I need to be successful in this position. My family medical situation has become a major financial burden, and the raise that I was given is not enough to keep up. \n\nI desperately want to leave this company for good, but I feel like there is nothing I can do but wait for my bonus contract obligation to be fulfilled by staying for another year.

I\u2019m saying this because the program I entered (which I won\u2019t name as I plan to keep using this Reddit account), advertised this as an analytics degree for everyone interested, with only an understanding of basic statistics necessary and other than that, having \u2018quantitative interest\u2019.\n\nNow, I have the INTEREST part down but did that translate to actual skill? Well uh, my bachelor\u2019s was in a field related to psychology and required math was minimal. I started learning to code on my own time before applying to the program (at a top 40 school with a \u201ctop 10\u201d analytics program) and was accepted. The program director assured me that those without such a strong coding or math background would learn everything in the program. I proceeded to do incredibly well in the first course which was online, then for the remaining courses I was to move to the city where the college is and finish the rest of it in person.\n\nSo I move there and get into it, and immediately there\u2019s a machine learning class that\u2019s nothing but pure math for the first two weeks (calculus level). There were students who like math who couldn\u2019t understand the lecture at all, and the only students who seemed to know what was going on were people who had already been working as analysts and wanted to get a masters.\n\nOther courses consisted of following what the teachers were clicking or typing but without having time to learn what it all meant. Learn it badly, students leave the room confused or with a hollow understanding, then go from this to immediately submitting homework and projects. \n\nThe degree is also accelerated (completed in 10 months\u2026) \u2014 which leads me to the point:\n- schools are jumping on the wave of data science/analytics and trying to condense the subject into short yet expensive programs  where they can get new batches of students through quickly. If the school is good, they use their name branding to make as much money as possible.\n- these programs are not suitable for career changers or people without technical or high quantitative skills unless you happen to get put in a theory-based program or something. In mine you had to submit the work properly or just fail out I guess, or try to chat-GPT it or consult people online (I found a lot of the machine learning quiz questions posted online for \u201cexperts\u201d to answer).\n- expanding on above point, the program doesn\u2019t have the necessary prerequisites to prepare people for what they will have you do particularly in a quantitative sense. This makes it impossible to produce an incoming class of students that are on the same page.\n- the school uses students as promotion tools: they hold events to highlight student work to display \u201chow much they\u2019ve learned in such a short time\u201d but in reality, the highlighted students are the ones who were working as analysts before the program started\u2026.

I\u2019m saying this because the program I entered (which I won\u2019t name as I plan to keep using this Reddit account), advertised this as an analytics degree for everyone interested, with only an understanding of basic statistics necessary and other than that, having \u2018quantitative interest\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I have the INTEREST part down but did that translate to actual skill? Well uh, my bachelor\u2019s was in a field related to psychology and required math was minimal. I started learning to code on my own time before applying to the program (at a top 40 school with a \u201ctop 10\u201d analytics program) and was accepted. The program director assured me that those without such a strong coding or math background would learn everything in the program. I proceeded to do incredibly well in the first course which was online, then for the remaining courses I was to move to the city where the college is and finish the rest of it in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I move there and get into it, and immediately there\u2019s a machine learning class that\u2019s nothing but pure math for the first two weeks (calculus level). There were students who like math who couldn\u2019t understand the lecture at all, and the only students who seemed to know what was going on were people who had already been working as analysts and wanted to get a masters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other courses consisted of following what the teachers were clicking or typing but without having time to learn what it all meant. Learn it badly, students leave the room confused or with a hollow understanding, then go from this to immediately submitting homework and projects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The degree is also accelerated (completed in 10 months\u2026) \u2014 which leads me to the point:\n- schools are jumping on the wave of data science/analytics and trying to condense the subject into short yet expensive programs  where they can get new batches of students through quickly. If the school is good, they use their name branding to make as much money as possible.\n- these programs are not suitable for career changers or people without technical or high quantitative skills unless you happen to get put in a theory-based program or something. In mine you had to submit the work properly or just fail out I guess, or try to chat-GPT it or consult people online (I found a lot of the machine learning quiz questions posted online for \u201cexperts\u201d to answer).\n- expanding on above point, the program doesn\u2019t have the necessary prerequisites to prepare people for what they will have you do particularly in a quantitative sense.
