To preface, I started a new job almost a year ago, I graduated with my MBA last year, and I had 2 years of experience as a data analyst prior. \n\nWhen I started my job, I was very excited because of all the glamor and hype that comes along with a space program, but that excitement is gone. My company is a start up, and everyone in my sector has started within the last year or two. A few months in, I realized how poor of processes this company had, if any, along with an evident lack of leadership. We had a major re-organization that left many people without jobs, and on top of that, we let go close to a third of our employees at the same time. We have had drastic funding issues and schedule issues because of that, so overall, the mood has not been good. Additionally, I was put on a \u201cneed to know\u201d program that will potentially take the company down an ethical path that I am not willing to go down. \n\nI kept holding on thinking that maybe just maybe things would get better, but I also had family health issues that required me to leave the state permanently right as my company put in a mandatory work from office policy.  \n\nWith all this being said, I was offered a very nice position at another company that would be a 15% increase in pay in the state I was moving to, but the position was one that I knew that I would be unfulfilled and very unhappy doing. Regardless, I decided that the stability and being able to move for my family was more important than the role, so I turned in my notice at my current job and prepared to take this new one. \n\nOur sector VP, however, made a counter offer for me to stay with the company remote, and they would not only match the opposing company but give me yet an additional 7% raise and a promotion and a sizeable bonus to move. I naively accepted the offer but with the catch that if I left within 12 months, I would have to pay back that bonus in full. \n\nFast forward, things have only gotten worse at this company, and the ethical concern is seeming to become a reality.  I am also in a bad situation in that I am not qualified to be in the promotion I was given, or at least I am not getting the support I need to be successful in this position. My family medical situation has become a major financial burden, and the raise that I was given is not enough to keep up. \n\nI desperately want to leave this company for good, but I feel like there is nothing I can do but wait for my bonus contract obligation to be fulfilled by staying for another year. I also feel like if I were to get another job, I would have to take a pay cut due to my lack of experience, but my current financial situation is already struggling.

I\u2019m currently 8 months in, and while I\u2019ve requested for things to change and be rotated , nothing is happening except them offering to put me on DS courses with the intention of \u201ckeep your skills sharp and we can talk about rotations in the future when an opportunity happens \u201d. I am taking those course at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m honestly a bit worried with being stuck in the Platform Engineer space forever, as my program is 2 years and I\u2019m already 8 months in. I\u2019m also worried that I won\u2019t be able to find a data science related job with experience as a platform engineer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this actually going to majorly affect my career pathway? Should I be taking action right now or complete my program first? I do work for a very well recognized bank at the moment, but  I\u2019m not sure if the reputation alone will help. Is there any words of advice or direction that someone can give me?
