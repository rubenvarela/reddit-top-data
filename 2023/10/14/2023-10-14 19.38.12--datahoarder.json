I have started editing videos, so I will have a lot of big files in the future. Because of 4K resolution, high bitrate and more versions of the same project, I can create more than 10 TB of video files every month. I want to keep my projects possibly forever. Those files will not be accessed very often, but I would also like to avoid some cold cloud storage where restoring data can take many hours. So files should be accessible quite fast, but on the other hand, they won't be accessed on daily basis. I will have also some databases and 3D engine projects, but those files would be always copied to NVMe SSD when I would work with them.\n\nI have heard about [Sync.com](https://Sync.com) unlimited cloud storage plan, but I don't have any experience with them and I have heard about low upload speeds etc. \n\nSo I am thinking I will need to just keep buying HDDs and save my project backups on those drives. I don't think NAS is needed as data will not be synced between devices and data will be accessed only from time to time. \n\nMy current plan is to buy an external 3.5\" USB HDD docking station for 2 - 4 hard drives and just use it only when I will need to write/read/copy back to faster SSD purposes.

I'm completely new to running a fully-featured Plex server (though I briefly ran an Nvidia Shield PMS), and I could use some help figuring out some of the details with how things should be set up. \n\nI'm going to have all my media stored on a DS1522+, with two 12TB Seagate Ironwolf drives and another 12TB Western Digital drive that I need to shuck out of an EasyStore external hard drive enclosure. \n\nThat WD drive currently has a few hundred 4K Blu-Ray rips from when I tried running an Nvidia Shield server, so I'd like to keep the media on them when I set up the Synology box.\n\nI'd also like to run Plex Media Server natively on the Mac mini vs. running in a Docker container, as I've heard PMS runs really well, now that it's native to Apple Silicon. I'd like to use the hardware for transcoding, when necessary. \n\nOn the DS1522+, I'd like to run Docker containers for Sonarr, Radarr, and Sabnzbd (or nzbget, whichever is better). Basically, I\u2019d like to have the NAS handle all downloading and media storage and have the Mac exclusively run all Plex server tasks.\n\nSo with this information in mind can you help answer these questions:\n\n1.\tWould there be any benefit to upgrading the hardware on the DS1522+, like the RAM, NVMe, or 10GbE?\n2.\tDo I need to run a RAID or SHR on the NAS for ideal performance?

Currently I have a 7 year old WD My Cloud 4TB that&amp;#39;s no longer supported, so it only works at home, no remote access.  Which is fine.  But it&amp;#39;s old and I was looking to replace it with a 2 bay NAS that I could use in mirroring mode.  Just to hold my media files.  The Sonos speakers and my Xbox do all the processing work for playback, so I just need the NAS to serve the files.  I&amp;#39;m not familiar with Plex, but I hear that the NAS often does work to transcode videos for playback.  I don&amp;#39;t need that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have Windows 11 on my PC, and I was looking to hook up the new NAS with 2 new HDDs installed (8TB drives) and have them mirrored so I have 8TB of storage.  Then I load it with my audio and video files and just use my Sonos speakers and Xbox (with the Kodi app) for playing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice on what to buy appreciated.  What I put on the NAS is already backed up on multiple hard drives and stored away.  The NAS data isn&amp;#39;t critical.  I just wanted mirroring to make life easier when a NAS drive dies.
