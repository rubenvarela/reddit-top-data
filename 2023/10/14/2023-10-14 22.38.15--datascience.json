Prior to this role, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for a year and a half.\n\nIn my current position, I spend a significant portion of my time conducting data analysis, applying basic statistical techniques (hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc), and developing standard banking models (so far, I've worked in churn rate prediction, client clustering, and currently studying to help building a recommendation system)\n\nI'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science, with a research focus on weather forecasting. This research involves the use of time series analysis and machine learning. As we progress in our research, we are also delving into deep learning models, the goal is to build state of art models.\n\nMy academic background is in computer science. In both bachelor's and master's I've completed classes in basic linear algebra, three levels of calculus (up to Multivariate Calculus and First Order Differential Equations), discrete mathematics, two statistics courses, one time series analysis course, and several classes focused on machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile I generally have a good understanding of the mathematical principles behind machine learning models, there are certain areas where I struggle. For instance, I've never fully comprehended why the kernel trick is effective in SVMs (got the intuition, but not the maths)\n\nWhen it comes to statistics, I feel that my knowledge is lacking. I can effectively work with machine learning frameworks, but there are specific statistical topics where my knowledge is either superficial or non-existent.
