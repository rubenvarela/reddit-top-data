I was able to accomplish it by building a simple model were I manually entered weights depending on how important I thought each feature was. I then set up a pipeline to update these weights as real data would come in. Was it perfect? No. But it did a good enough job while we were waiting for data and made the client happy.

Imagine you are asked to build a model using datasets you do not know exist yet, coming from source systems with little-to-no descriptions of what the features mean. Somehow you need to find the right data in a sea of millions of irrelevant features. You will need to fight political battles to even get access to the features you do not yet know if you even need. You will need to track down knowledgeable people who can tell you the weird quirks in the data (e.g. missing months were poorly imputed when this random country suffered a natural disaster 12 years ago). You then need to build a full pipeline that pulls the data from 10 different data sources that don't link to each other naturally, do regression tests because they don't update consistently, transform it, do feature engineering, feed it to a model, monitor the model for drift, redo everything after you find out a feature is completely different from what you were told, and the list goes on. This is not an exaggeration, it is typical. It goes way beyond cleaning up a few outliers and training a prototype model. This experience can only be gained by doing it.\n\n**Being easy to work with**: A bad hire can be a disaster! One person can ruin group moral and be difficult to get rid of. It can be difficult to judge personality from a few interviews. Haveing work experience where you got along with the same team for years greatly reduces that risk.\n\nThere are many others, but these are three big ones.

Even if you are one of the lucky few who get a job out of college in this market, your manager is probably clueless of these issues (i.e. won't be able to help you) and setting you up for failure.

in Mathematics in 2018. I worked 1 year as a program associate for a non-profit, managing their database and writing reports for grants/funding purposes. I then switched to a job in retirement investing as an analyst. I was originally going to start grad school (for a Masters in DS) in the Fall of 2021 but delayed to 2022 due to covid so I stayed at that job for 2 years.\n\nI enjoyed working with data and numbers, I kind of like how it feels to develop that tunnel vision and fixate on numbers lol. So I thought data science would be a good fit given those jobs revolved around data and it would be something financially stable (of course having no idea just how much covid et al. would impact the job market).\n\nIn the fall of the 2nd year of my Master's I received an offer to work for a large Healthcare company, which is where I am currently employed. To be honest, I genuinely hate it. I'm stuck working on the insurance side and it just feels miserable and unethical to me on a daily basis. I was hoping to join a team on the clinical side but wound up on the healthcare side due to the way the company matches employees to teams. I realized I miss working more directly with people, as I am on the west coast and the entirety of my team is on the East Coast or in India.\n\nI can't really tell if my misery is because of the company I work for itself or the field in general. I think I want something more interesting than what I am currently doing. I work with insurance plan design data. I applied to this job on a whim, because of the condition of the job market I felt I had to apply to all sorts of things. I'm personally opposed to for- profit healthcare but accepted because I didnt feel I had much choice as it was the only offer I received after hundreds of applications over many months. \n\nDoes anyone else feel extremely unsatisfied as a data scientist or as a data engineer? I guess I feel really under-stimulated and extremely unsatisfied. I don't know if every job feels like this and I have to suck it up, or if I should just leave. I've only been here 3 months and my resume is inconsistent enough as is so it feels too risky to leave even if I had a different offer lined up.\n\nI'd love to hear about people who switched into data science / engineering then changed their mind.

I am a Data Scientist experienced in Marketing Science, and am writing a small online book regarding topics that are important in marketing science. I wrote a chapter regarding:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The law of diminishing returns&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- ROAS and Marginal ROAS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Advertisement elasticity on Returns&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that it is useful for everybody. Any feedback is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://phc4rdoso.github.io/2.%20The%20Law%20of%20Diminishing%20Returns.html\"&gt;https://phc4rdoso.github.io/2.%20The%20Law%20of%20Diminishing%20Returns.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "937a6f50-d780-11e7-826d-0ed1beddcc82", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1798de7", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "G4L1C", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1798de7/applied_data_science_in_marketing_how_to_measure/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1798de7/applied_data_science_in_marketing_how_to_measure/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1087300, "created_utc": 1697469358.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
