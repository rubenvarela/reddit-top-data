They overpromised to senior leadership because the company is suffering. And they want me to over-deliver and do the paperwork/put this model into production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve asked to delay the deadline to get access to the KPIs for the model, but all they did was move the model due date up by\u2026. A month. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m having panic attacks and can\u2019t sleep because this is just setting me up to fail. I\u2019m so burnt out after speaking with management/teams.

It\u2019s due tomorrow, but there\u2019s no way I can feasibly do that. I\u2019ve tried meds and even thought of taking myself out of office this week to avoid this, but I lack the PTO.

very funny claim that people in our industry have been using AI to do half of their job, so I decided to give in a shot, and signed up for GPT 4.0 for $20.\n\n\n**Example one. Tableau**\n\nThe first thing I threw at it was Tableau. Everything I wanted to do in tablo that I already knew how to do, I first asked it how to do, wrote the instructions painstakingly direct and accurately, and it almost wrote a coherent and useful answer every time. But I would say 75% of the time, the answer was completely wrong. There were basics that it could not comprehend. For example, cannot mix aggregate and non-aggregate expressions. GPT got stuck on this dozens upon dozens of times, every time it wrote an if statement, It was wrong. Completely and utterly wrong, because you cannot mix aggregate and non-aggregate statements, and it simply would not understand that no matter how many times I put the error message back into the chat and it apologized and spit out another piece of code. Half the time it was just wrong\n\n\nIt also struggled to understand basic logic about how to put a dashboard together. For example if I wanted a chart that could have diverging columns, and to split those columns in two based on a specific field, for example if I had region, or state, It struggled to understand the best ways to do it. The logic part of it was completely lost onto AI, and as a result, even the most basic tasks were impossible\n\n\n**Example two. Basic communication**\n\n\nAnother thing that Open AI GPT really struggled with was basic communication, in other words, communicating like a normal, ordinary human being that is not completely insane, or a lunatic. Sometimes I would ask it to help me write a response to a recruiter, or draft an email to someone in a friendly and concise way. I made sure to use very specific words that would apply to an ordinary person working at a company. However, all of the responses it provided were terrible. It would use very weird language that made the writer of the message sound like a complete lunatic. Weird things like poetry, and sounding like I'm writing a love letter or something. It struggled to understand how to just have a plain, completely neutral tone message. \n\n**Example 3. Deception**\n\n\nBeing an AI, or computer program, It is not intentionally deceptive. The program is just trying to do what the user asks it to do, yet 50% of the time, GPT is very deceptive, and lies. For example when you ask it to write a cover letter for you and you give it a job description and your resume, It might right something completely false in your cover letter that you don't realize if you don't read every single line of the response. If you're applying to a position that covers things you have not done in the past and is not included in your resume, it will insert them. For example, what if you haven't used TensorFlow? Doesn't matter, if it's in the job description that you provided it, it's going to put it in your cover letter. It's going to talk about your experience using TensorFlow, and completely make up a bunch of crap. This makes you a liar if you use this. \n\n\nGPT fills in the gaps of what it does not know with what it is provided. It does not have creative and logical reasoning like we do. So when you ask it to do something and it doesn't understand, it won't simply skip over that part, it will instead perform that specific aspect, even if it's wrong. So if you ask it to write a resume and it doesn't know if you have done something that is usually included in part of a job, it'll just include it anyway. Doesn't matter if you did it or not. Now you did, and you and GPT are both liars\n\n\n\nJust three simple examples that I thought were very interesting.

There is one small team of people with &amp;quot;data scientist&amp;quot; titles in the whole org but they are in a separate silo from me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally I am tossed tasks that don&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense: for example comparing forecast accuracy for the exact same models between a no-code out of the box forecaster like SAP IBP with Python models that a contractor they hired built. Other times I will get requests so vague like &amp;quot;build us a chatbot&amp;quot;. I have always hounded them with questions and shared my opinions on these asks, but basically get told to shut up and go away each time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now they have cut what I can only assume is a few million dollar check with a large consulting company to build out a demand and inventory forecasting model. The thing is, they just launched an out-of-the-box SAP solution less than 2 years ago which does exactly that: inventory and demand forecasting. I can&amp;#39;t imagine that project was less than a few million as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all of this, no one can ever really articulate to me why we are doing this or what specifically they are trying to improve. It seems like they don&amp;#39;t even realize the consultants will likely build a very similar model to SAP. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are most companies like this? Only some? It has been very stressful for me, as 4 people have also been let go from my team within the year I&amp;#39;ve worked here. It seems like they have no vision or clue what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "179945p", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MikeyCyrus", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/179945p/how_many_companies_actually_have_a_clear_plan_for/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/179945p/how_many_companies_actually_have_a_clear_plan_for/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1086841, "created_utc": 1697471271.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hello all!
