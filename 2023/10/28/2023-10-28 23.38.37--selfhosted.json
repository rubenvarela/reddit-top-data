They also offered a version called \"pfSense Plus\" which was paid and offered a few more features but also support from Netgate, which is of course perfectly fine and very common (look at Proxmox for example).\n\nA while ago (1,5 years) they introduced \"**Home+Lab**\" as a product and license version in order for casual users and \"homelabbers\" to dip a toe into their commercial offerings which has more features than the CE. Basically like \"here you can use our enterprise version for free, but its a bit limited of course\". The obvious goal there is to motivate users to switch from the free CE to a paid version, again nothing wrong with that. [Portainer for example does this too](https://www.portainer.io/take-3).\n\nBecause of this, users switched from the \"always\" free CE version to the \"Home+Lab\" version, upgrading their installations and enjoying a few more features. According to Netgate, thousands of users have installed it. Great!\n\n___\n\n# Now\n\nBut just now [Netgate have announced](https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab) major changes to this, out of the blue, **without any prior notice**. The free \"Home+Lab\" version is no longer available for download, its just gone.\n\nAs a reason they cite that thirdparty sellers (on Aliexpress etc. i imagine) were downloading the \"better\" version of pfSense, aka the \"Home+Lab\" version, and installing it on their hardware appliances and then selling them. Without Netgate seeing any revenue from this. \n\n___\n\nPlease see [their blogpost](https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab) for all the details. But one crucial point is that anyone who is currently running their \"Home+Lab\" version, can keep running it (yay!) but they also say that **future upgrades and bugfixes may require a subscription**. So basically, users installed a free \"better\" version, which now doesnt exist anymore, and to continue using it with updates, they \"might\" need to pay a subscription fee. Something as crucial like a firewall appliance should be kept up to date for security, so just ignoring that is not really a option. And Netgate also state that if you have to reinstall your current \"Home+Lab\" version, they cannot provide that for free to you. And those subscriptions apparently come at a very high price. **Are you willing to pay $400/year for your firewall software when youre only using it privately in your small homelab?**\n\nPaying for software, or any product, is not a bad thing. And companies need to make money, they need to pay employees. This should be obvious. There is no problem with that in itself. But the way this was done, telling their userbase for quite a while to try out this free version of the premium product, and then pulling the rug away underneath the feet, is just plain wrong and fucked up.\n\n___\n\n*\"Okay whatever, then just switch back to the actual free CE version!\"* Great idea, but apparently thats not so super easy.\n\nYouTuber **Lawrence Systems** has already made a excellent video summing up all these changes. I would recommend watching it to get the full picture, i can and want to only cover the essentials here:\n\n* [Addressing Licence Changes to pfSense Plus Home and Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXI6-E1nc5M)\n\nHe also made a video about switching back from pfSense plus (aka Home+Lab?) to pfSense CE:\n\n* [How to Convert From pfsense plus 23.05 to pfsense CE 2.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFUcmWTazGg)\n\nReading recent posts about this on /r/pfSense subreddit, the community seems to be quite angry about this. And it doesnt help that their subreddit is actually run by Netgate employees, so it isnt exactly a independent discussion forum there at all. For example a user tried to get feedback and support for [a tool to convert pfSense configs to OPNsense configs](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/17hs7o2/bounty_for_pfsense_to_opnsense_conversion/), and the moderators removed the post without further comment.\n\n___\n\nMy personal recommendation would be that this is a huge opportunity to finally switch away from pfSense, they have shown once again that they cannot be trusted. Take a look at the most obvious \"competitor\" /r/OPNsense, they started as a fork of pfSense and have developed quite nicely over the years.\n\nAnd to make it even more clear what kind of people are running Netgate (pfSense), if you havent read it yet, [this is the story](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-com/) of when users announced the fork OPNsense, how Netgate was running `opnsense.com` which was a mock website **entirely made to shit on the OPNsense project and discredit them**. [I encourage you to look at it and make up your own mind about it](http://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http:/www.opnsense.com/). And guess who exactly was running that website? Some disgruntled hardcore pfSense fan, or some low level employee who went too far? No, it was **the founder &amp; CEO of Netgate**. This alone should be reason enough to **never use anything by Netgate**, ever, wether its a free CE or paid.\n\nThe story of how badly [Netgate fucked up the attempted integration of Wireguard](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/buffer-overruns-license-violations-and-bad-code-freebsd-13s-close-call/) into FreeBSD and pfSense is also quite interesting, especially how the leadership team reacted.\n\n___\n\nAtleast right now they are still offering the free and opensource CE version. But who knows how long that will last. They might as well kill that option without prior notice in a few months or a year from now. Its better to think about switching before being forced to. If you are currently using the CE version and youre happy with it, i would still recommend you make plans to switch.\n\n___\n\nThere have also been various other issues with Netgate\u00b4s behaviour towards their users over the years, but covering them all here would be too much and offtopic, i would like to focus this post mostly on the very recent issue.\n\nIf people get angry about Oracle and seemingly shutting down \"free\" VPS instances at random, then they should be angry about Netgate pulling shit like this too.\n\n___\n\n#TL;DR\n\n# Stop using pfSense (just any Netgate products), switch to something else.\n\nSince its becoming a theme in the comments, im going to list **a few alternatives**:\n\n* /r/OPNsense is the most obvious one to look at, they started as a fork of pfSense quite a while ago and have developed quite nicely. They finance themselves by also offering hardware appliances and business support. The software is free and opensource of course. They do offer a Business Edition of it which includes a handful of special features but i honestly cant imagine that those are very important to a typical homelab user. I think some of them can also be replicated with plugins from the community. As examples there are plugins for Wireguard, Zabbix agent, Zerotier, HAProxy, Traefik, Unbound, Adguard Home and many more. The default UI theme isnt really nice but you have a few choices as plugins, i like Vicuna.\n\n* [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) is very lightweight and fast, but in exchange it might lack some of the features of OPNsense/pfSense tho. Just depends what you exactly need, take a look. Its often used as alternative firmware on some routers, but it can also run straight on common x86_64 hardware or in a VM.\n\n* [VyOS](https://vyos.net) has also been mentioned, i never used it myself. From a quick look its opensource, but to use their stable LTS releases [you need to buy a subscription](https://support.vyos.io/en/support/solutions/articles/103000096261-what-s-vyos-release-model-), otherwise you need to use their nightly builds.\n\n* [Sophos UTM](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/unified-threat-management) has been mentioned but im not sure this actually makes sense as alternative, let me know if im wrong. UTM and some other products [seem to be EOL](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/unified-threat-management/free-trial) anyway, but [XG Firewall Home Edition](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/free-tools/sophos-xg-firewall-home-edition) still exists i guess so maybe thats a alternative to pfSense. They do force you to provide a valid email adress tho. And none of their products seem to be opensource.\n\n* [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com) makes great hardware at fair prices, and they have their RouterOS software which is quite capable too. Their [RouterOS](https://mikrotik.com/software) can also run on standard x86_64 hardware, or in a VM. There is also CHR (Cloud Hosted Router) as a version optimized for running in local or cloud VMs. Both RouterOS and CHR require a paid license beyond a short free trial. Purchasing specific Mikrotik hardware typically includes a license.\n\nIf someone would be interested in a tool to convert existing pfSense configuration to OPNsense, and might be willing to contribute in a way, please check [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/17hs7o2/bounty_for_pfsense_to_opnsense_conversion/) on /r/Homelab.\n\n___\n\n*Disclaimer: I am no pfSense expert, very far from it. If i got any of the history or current events wrong in this post, please let me know and i will immediately correct them. For me when the time came to pick a (virtualized) firewall/router appliance, i installed both pfSense and OPNsense in VMs and took a quick look. Even tho pfSense did leave a very \"enterprise-ish\" impression, it didnt feel right somehow, just odd in some way. Then looking at OPNsense, i felt immediately at home, i cant really narrow down why exactly. It simply felt much more open and friendly from the beginning. And i mean the software, at that point i had no idea what was going on between pfSense and OPNsense. All i knew was that OPNsense originated from pfSense, thats all. I tried both a tiny bit and quickly decided that i like OPNsense more, and thats what i have been using for a long time now and im very happy with it.*\n\n___\n\n*None of the existing flair options seem to really fit to this, so forgive me for not having any flair.

If you&amp;#39;re interested in this setup, I put the Node-Red flow in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is useful to someone else!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a79c57222d74bf9be9cc3ca658fc76f268de2bcc", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=265a13d314e2c662718baa22bd6a9cddd66dcd93", "width": 108, "height": 54}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac22e28a51d3cb78bb86a128c5f35baca9e2e7e", "width": 216, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616f0182c9db2c56b4836da56d1409f209a7efe6", "width": 320, "height": 160}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8265f5bd442825bf4e4ceab37d4abe36a8c9dea9", "width": 640, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d72e23fe1883119fc5851d44448e6b81ac648945", "width": 960, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac89a9de18abaec4379968a9621a7fb9450bd22", "width": 1080, "height": 540}], "variants": {}, "id": "gGFsYNhbrvht4OBHwo2a7eS_0jU1_XZK88mVWprJJtk"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17i65bc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chasx003", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/17i65bc/a_docker_image_for_a_runalyze_fork_a_fitness/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/17i65bc/a_docker_image_for_a_runalyze_fork_a_fitness/", "subreddit_subscribers": 286004, "created_utc": 1698467998.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "Hello, I've been looking at many guides but I'm having trouble understanding how to selfhost VaultWarden locally.

I\u00b4ve searched around a bit, and the only things I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the server localhost only =&amp;gt; then I won\u00b4t be able to use phone apps anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Server password =&amp;gt; this doesn\u00b4t solve the auth issue, my friends will still be able to impersonate each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the server localhost only and then let users connect via ZNC, which hooks into Cyrus SASL =&amp;gt; this was a huge pain in the ass to set up, and still doesn\u00b4t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do this via services somehow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would be the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; way to implement this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "82508a80-05bc-11eb-ae09-0effb713859f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17insce", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "myamazingaltaccount", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/17insce/private_irc_server_with_local_user_accounts/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/17insce/private_irc_server_with_local_user_accounts/", "subreddit_subscribers": 286004, "created_utc": 1698529083.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "Basically, I have this doubt, I have some self hosted services in docker where I add the ports like this:host\\_port:container\\_port, so I don't specify the interface, so by default, it is [0.0.0.0](https://0.0.0.0).\n\nSomebody recently told me that this is dangerous and that I expose my services to the public internet by doing this.
