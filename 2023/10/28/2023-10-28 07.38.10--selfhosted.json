They also offered a version called \"pfSense Plus\" which was paid and offered a few more features but also support from Netgate, which is of course perfectly fine and very common (look at Proxmox for example).\n\nA while ago (1,5 years) they introduced \"**Home+Lab**\" as a product and license version in order for casual users and \"homelabbers\" to dip a toe into their commercial offerings which has more features than the CE. Basically like \"here you can use your enterprise version for free, but its a bit limited of course\". The obvious goal there is to motivate users to switch from the free CE to a paid version, again nothing wrong with that. [Portainer for example does this too](https://www.portainer.io/take-3).\n\nBecause of this, users switched from the \"always\" free CE version to the \"Home+Lab\" version, upgrading their installations and enjoying a few more features. According to Netgate, thousands of users have installed it. Great!\n\n___\n\n# Now\n\nBut just now [Netgate have announced](https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab) major changes to this, out of the blue, **without any prior notice**. The free \"Home+Lab\" version is no longer available for download, its just gone.\n\nAs a reason they cite that thirdparty sellers (on Aliexpress etc. i imagine) were downloading the \"better\" version of pfSense, aka the \"Home+Lab\" version, and installing it on their hardware appliances and then selling them. Without Netgate seeing any revenue from this. \n\n___\n\nPlease see [their blogpost](https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab) for all the details. But one crucial point is that anyone who is currently running their \"Home+Lab\" version, can keep running it (yay!) but they also say that **future upgrades and bugfixes may require a subscription**. So basically, users installed a free \"better\" version, which now doesnt exist anymore, and to continue using it with updates, they \"might\" need to pay a subscription fee. Something as crucial like a firewall appliance should be kept up to date for security, so just ignoring that is not really a option. And Netgate also state that if you have to reinstall your current \"Home+Lab\" version, they cannot provide that for free to you. And those subscriptions apparently come at a very high price. **Are you willing to pay $400/year for your firewall software when youre only using it privately in your small homelab?**\n\nPaying for software, or any product, is not a bad thing. And companies need to make money, they need to pay employees. This should be obvious. There is no problem with that in itself. But the way this was done, telling their userbase for quite a while to try out this free version of the premium product, and then pulling the rug away underneath the feet, is just plain wrong and fucked up.\n\n___\n\n*\"Okay whatever, then just switch back to the actual free CE version!\"* Great idea, but apparently thats not so super easy.\n\n**Lawrence Systems** have already made a excellent video summing up all these changes. I would recommend watching it to get the full picture, i can and want to only cover a bit here:\n\n* [Addressing Licence Changes to pfSense Plus Home and Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXI6-E1nc5M)\n\nThey also made a video about switching back from pfSense plus (aka Home+Lab?) to pfSense CE:\n\n* [How to Convert From pfsense plus 23.05 to pfsense CE 2.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFUcmWTazGg)\n\nReading recent posts about this on /r/pfSense subreddit, the community seems to be quite angry about this. And it doesnt help that their subreddit is actually run by Netgate employees, so it isnt exactly a independent discussion forum there at all. For example a user tried to get feedback and support for [a tool to convert pfSense configs to OPNsense configs](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/17hs7o2/bounty_for_pfsense_to_opnsense_conversion/), and the moderators removed the post without further comment.\n\n___\n\nMy personal recommendation would be that this is a huge opportunity to finally switch away from pfSense, they have shown once again that they cannot be trusted. Take a look at the most obvious \"competitor\" /r/OPNsense /r/OPNsenseFirewall, they started as a fork of pfSense and have developed quite nicely.\n\nAnd to make it even more clear what kind of people are running Netgate (pfSense), if you havent read it yet, [this is the story](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-com/) of when users announced the fork OPNsense, how a **employee of Netgate** was running `opnsense.com` which was a mock website **entirely made to shit on the OPNsense project and discredit them**. [I encourage you to look at it and make up your own mind about it](http://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http:/www.opnsense.com/). And yes, [this employee still works for them today it seems](https://www.netgate.com/blog/author/jamie-thompson). This alone should be reason enough to **never use anything by Netgate**, ever, wether its a free CE or paid.\n\nAtleast right now they are still offering the free and opensource CE version. But who knows how long that will last. They might as well kill that option without prior notice in a few months or a year from now. Its better to think about switching before being forced to.\n\n___\n\nThere have also been various other issues with Netgate\u00b4s behaviour towards their users over the years, but covering them all here would be too much and offtopic, i would like to focus this post mostly on the very recent issue.\n\nIf people get angry about Oracle and seemingly shutting down \"free\" VPS instances at random, then they should be angry about Netgate pulling shit like this too.\n\n___\n\n#TL;DR\n\n**Stop using pfSense (just any Netgate products), switch to something else.**\n\nIts not the only alternative, but /r/OPNsense /r/OPNsenseFirewall is one major example.\n\n___\n\n*Disclaimer: I am no pfSense expert, very far from it. If i got any of the history or current events wrong in this post, please let me know and i will immediately correct them. For me when the time came to pick a (virtualized) firewall/router appliance, i installed both pfSense and OPNsense in VMs and took a quick look. Even tho pfSense did leave a very \"enterprise-ish\" impression, it didnt feel right somehow, just odd in some way. Then looking at OPNsense, i felt immediately at home, i cant really narrow down why exactly. It simply felt much more open and friendly from the beginning. And i mean the software, at that point i had no idea what was going on between pfSense and OPNsense. All i knew was that OPNsense originated from pfSense, thats all. I tried both a tiny bit and quickly decided that i like OPNsense more, and thats what i have been using for a long time now and im very happy with it.*\n\n___\n\n*None of the existing flair options seem to really fit to this, so forgive me for not having any flair.

Included in this release are a couple big features, a number of improvements, and a LOT of small fixes.\n\n\n# Authentication\n\nSupport for session based, Basic and OAuth-backed authentication is now stable and generally available. Limit access to your library by enabling authentication, and grant limited access to your friends and family by giving them a specific role (viewer, editor or admin).\n\nMachine-to-machine communication is now possible via the API, and one of the supported authentication methods (basic or token based). [Read more about it on the wiki](https://github.com/zurdi15/romm/wiki/Authentication).\n\n\n# Background worker\n\nThis release adds experimental support for Redis, which, along with enabling session-backed authentication, allows RomM to run library scans in a background worker. This means any scan you run against your library will continue to run, even if you navigate to another page, or close the window entirely.\n\n&gt;Not included in 2.0 (but coming in a future 2.x release) is the ability to schedule and run asynchronous tasks, which will help manage your library behind-the-scenes.\n\n\n# Bulk selection\n\nManaging large libraries is now much easier using the gallery bulk selector, which allows you to mass rescan, update, download and delete a selection of games.\n\n\n# So what's next?\n\nIn the short term, we plan to improve basic functionality, add more features to the client (collections, recently added, UI options, etc.), introduce scheduled backend tasks (automated library management), and refactor the backend to make it easier to build on later\n\n\nIn the long term, there are two feature we're keen to build: .DAT file support (automated game recognition via hash comparison) and physical device management. This would allow you to send games to your devices (Retrodeck, OnionOS, GarlicOS, PC, Android, etc.) and sync save states/save files between devices.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please post them in the comments and we'll be happy to answer them!\n\n\nCheck the [release notes](https://github.com/zurdi15/romm/releases/tag/v2.0.0) to check the breaking changes that this version has.

Included in this release are a couple big features, a number of improvements, and a LOT of small fixes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Authentication&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Support for session based, Basic and OAuth-backed authentication is now stable and generally available. Limit access to your library by enabling authentication, and grant limited access to your friends and family by giving them a specific role (viewer, editor or admin).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Machine-to-machine communication is now possible via the API, and one of the supported authentication methods (basic or token based). &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/zurdi15/romm/wiki/Authentication\"&gt;Read more about it on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Background worker&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This release adds experimental support for Redis, which, along with enabling session-backed authentication, allows RomM to run library scans in a background worker. This means any scan you run against your library will continue to run, even if you navigate to another page, or close the window entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not included in 2.0 (but coming in a future 2.x release) is the ability to schedule and run asynchronous tasks, which will help manage your library behind-the-scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Bulk selection&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Managing large libraries is now much easier using the gallery bulk selector, which allows you to mass rescan, update, download and delete a selection of games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;So what&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the short term, we plan to improve basic functionality, add more features to the client (collections, recently added, UI options, etc.), introduce scheduled backend tasks (automated library management), and refactor the backend to make it easier to build on later&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the long term, there are two feature we&amp;#39;re keen to build: .DAT file support (automated game recognition via hash comparison) and physical device management. This would allow you to send games to your devices (Retrodeck, OnionOS, GarlicOS, PC, Android, etc.) and sync save states/save files between devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please post them in the comments and we&amp;#39;ll be happy to answer them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check the &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/zurdi15/romm/releases/tag/v2.0.0\"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; to check the breaking changes that this version has.

From the repo&amp;#39;s description, it checked most of my boxes \u2013 supporting various types of workouts, importing GPX and FIT files, and having an API for easy data uploads. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the project was lacking documentation for setting it up. But, with the help of &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/codeproducer198/Runalyze-Tools\"&gt;codeproducer198&amp;#39;s Docker template&lt;/a&gt; and some brute forcing with ChatGPT, I managed to get a Docker container up and running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those looking to self-host Runalyze, I&amp;#39;ve put together a working container and slightly better instructions in my fork, which you can find here: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/chasx003/Runalyze-Tools\"&gt;chasx003/Runalyze-Tools: Docker sample/template for self-hosted RUNALYZE (github.com)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re also interested in &amp;quot;auto-upload&amp;quot; from something like Apple Fitness, here&amp;#39;s my current process. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an Apple Shortcut triggering &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/healthfit/id1202650514\"&gt;HealthFit&lt;/a&gt; to sync workouts to Dropbox. Then, Node-Red monitors Dropbox for new workout files and uses Runalyze&amp;#39;s API to import workouts. If you&amp;#39;re interested in this setup, I put the Node-Red flow in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is useful to someone else!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a79c57222d74bf9be9cc3ca658fc76f268de2bcc", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=265a13d314e2c662718baa22bd6a9cddd66dcd93", "width": 108, "height": 54}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac22e28a51d3cb78bb86a128c5f35baca9e2e7e", "width": 216, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616f0182c9db2c56b4836da56d1409f209a7efe6", "width": 320, "height": 160}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8265f5bd442825bf4e4ceab37d4abe36a8c9dea9", "width": 640, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d72e23fe1883119fc5851d44448e6b81ac648945", "width": 960, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Pvthw-1V3JugNF4IscZrCd15jrcMWgkNX8ttMV4CIs.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac89a9de18abaec4379968a9621a7fb9450bd22", "width": 1080, "height": 540}], "variants": {}, "id": "gGFsYNhbrvht4OBHwo2a7eS_0jU1_XZK88mVWprJJtk"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_32hch", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17i65bc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chasx003", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfhosted/comments/17i65bc/a_docker_image_for_a_runalyze_fork_a_fitness/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/17i65bc/a_docker_image_for_a_runalyze_fork_a_fitness/", "subreddit_subscribers": 285884, "created_utc": 1698467998.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfhosted", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_3u10iil0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I have a pivpn on a pi &amp; a mesh system(192.168.5.1) connected to the isp's router(192.168.0.1).
