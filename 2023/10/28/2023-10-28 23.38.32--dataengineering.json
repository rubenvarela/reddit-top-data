We read a lot in this and other subs about doing projects to get a job, but I think there are a lot of misconceptions out there. Can we discuss projects? What has worked for you? What hasn't? Where am I wrong? \n\nCommon misconceptions:\n\n* Hiring managers will look at your projects. Yes, occasionally someone has looked at my projects, but it is rare. Most aren't interested. The bigger value is the knowledge you gain and your ability to discuss technical challenges you have solved. Being able to say things like \"CSV to BigQuery, how many bad characters did you have to filter out?\" or \"On-prem Spark? How long did it take to tune the settings?\" Little things that demonstrate experience. \n\n* Doing tutorials counts as a project. Sure, you may have outputs from the tutorials, but you don't have the right inputs. No design. No decision making. Few challenges. Projects should be your own work built through your own struggle. Anyone looking can tell if your \"project\" is just a tutorial you completed. \n\n*  A great Github account full of repos is a good portfolio. Sure, once you get to a fellow geek involved with hiring, they may look at your Github page. But, that is too far along in the hiring process. Even if you have good outputs in a reporting tool or web site, they may never get more than cursory glances. LinkedIn is your portfolio. Companies find you on LinkedIn. \n\nWhat makes a better project?\n\n1.  Find a problem (real or made up) and solve it with data. Automate ingestion, modeling and business logic using the tools you want to learn. Focus on using docs and Google, but feel free to do short tutorials as needed to learn something. Make sure you do the project on your own. \n\n2. Use data you care about. Can't say this applies to everyone, but I learn better when I have a reason to do the work. It could be part of my job or just a topic I'm interested in. Do you like movies? Do something with IMDB or TMDB data. Sports? Music? Migration patterns of mallards? As long as you know enough to generate questions you want answered, it's good. \n\n3. Make sure your project has these components: design doc, architecture doc, data model doc, code, user documentation. Even if no one looks at these, you will get comfortable creating them. Something many experienced DEs are not. \n\n4. If you can, find a customer for your project. I don't mean a paying customer, but someone who will use the outputs of the project. Someone you can practice the fine art of sussing out requirements with. This is another skill many experienced DEs lack. A customer will also give you ideas.    \n\nHow do you find customers? Do you know any small business owners that might be interested in automated data? Can you do something in your current job? How about looking through /r/database or /r/sql for people who need data for their hobby, but aren't trying to get into data? Maybe look for web developers who are looking for help.

I\u2019m currently using a stack of (primarily) Python, SQLite, sql server (on a vm), Google sheets. There are so many moving parts, \u201cworkarounds\u201d, exceptions I have to deal with, while also considering the clients\u2019 typically tall requests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m hoping, from this post, to gain some insight from others about what stack they use, ways to improve existing processes, anything else to possibly help preserve my sanity. I enjoy this work a lot, but I feel my lack of prior experience left me at a slight disadvantage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any and all feedback, input, etc.!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "2ca94cd6-ac27-11eb-a8eb-0e7f457f5bd3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "17iggeg", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iambatmanman", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/17iggeg/client_data_migration_questions_andor_discussion/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/17iggeg/client_data_migration_questions_andor_discussion/", "subreddit_subscribers": 136571, "created_utc": 1698507820.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nCurrently, I'm holding a position as a Project Analyst at a retail company.
