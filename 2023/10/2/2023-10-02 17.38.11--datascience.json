I recently switched into data science from bio, so I\u2019m not super familiar with how technical interviews should/normally go.\n\nFor some background, Karat is a third-party company that handles interviews for other companies. There is a Karat engineer (not affiliated with the company being applied to) who leads your interview. After the interview, you\u2019re given the option to reschedule an interview for at most a week later if you feel the interview didn\u2019t best demonstrate your skill set. \n\nFor me, there was one section dedicated to an SQL question and another section for leetcode-esque problems (1-3 depending on whether you complete them). I was under the impression that I could choose which language I would be tested on. I\u2019m familiar with Python and R, but have 0 experience with SQL. \n\nWith my luck, there was a whole section dedicated to SQL. I wasn\u2019t able to code it, but I was able to provide some bare bones algorithm to solve the problem. For the second section, I couldn\u2019t even finish one python problem. I was able to figure out why some things weren\u2019t working correctly, but in the end, I couldn\u2019t produce the correct output. \n\nI really did try to prepare by going through several leetcodes a day, but this truly was a humbling experience. My question is if anyone is familiar with Karat and whether it\u2019s worth doing a redo? I don\u2019t think I can learn SQL within a week, but at least I would be able to get a sense of the syntax. Or is it already over since I basically demonstrated incompetency even in a language I thought I was familiar with? \n\nI would also appreciate any advice for preparing for data science interviews with little professional experience.

I recently switched into data science from bio, so I\u2019m not super familiar with how technical interviews should/normally go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some background, Karat is a third-party company that handles interviews for other companies. There is a Karat engineer (not affiliated with the company being applied to) who leads your interview. After the interview, you\u2019re given the option to reschedule an interview for at most a week later if you feel the interview didn\u2019t best demonstrate your skill set. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, there was one section dedicated to an SQL question and another section for leetcode-esque problems (1-3 depending on whether you complete them). I was under the impression that I could choose which language I would be tested on. I\u2019m familiar with Python and R, but have 0 experience with SQL. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With my luck, there was a whole section dedicated to SQL. I wasn\u2019t able to code it, but I was able to provide some bare bones algorithm to solve the problem. For the second section, I couldn\u2019t even finish one python problem. I was able to figure out why some things weren\u2019t working correctly, but in the end, I couldn\u2019t produce the correct output. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really did try to prepare by going through several leetcodes a day, but this truly was a humbling experience. My question is if anyone is familiar with Karat and whether it\u2019s worth doing a redo? I don\u2019t think I can learn SQL within a week, but at least I would be able to get a sense of the syntax. Or is it already over since I basically demonstrated incompetency even in a language I thought I was familiar with? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also appreciate any advice for preparing for data science interviews with little professional experience.

Data Scientist for a company (part of the R&amp;D team).\n\nI have been with this company for about two years, and initially, everything seemed to be going well.\n\nAt a certain point, the organization (both in terms of projects and the team) started to fall apart: pointless meetings, lack of clarity, and much more.\n\nAfter several months, I realized that the main problem is the manager of the R&amp;D department, who, frankly speaking, does not understand anything about the technical side (starting from the programming language used and more).\n\nThis has caused me a sense of discomfort that makes me consider leaving.\n\nThe last straw was the assignment of a training course: initially, we were asked to choose a topic for a course (not necessarily related to the role, and in my case, I chose concepts of Data Engineering and frameworks like Airflow).\n\nWithout saying anything, this manager assigned a course to all of us, Data Scientists, and what did she assign us? A course on Data Science!\n\nWhat's the point! In fact, I'm completely skipping every single video as I already know all the concepts.\n\nHaving said that, can you give me some advice on how to handle this situation?\nEven better, can you suggest companies that have fully remote positions for Data Scientists?\n\nThanks everyone", "author_fullname": "t2_5mvcgpt8", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Looking for something different", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "career", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_16y0yfi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Career", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696263525.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to share my experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am currently working as a Data Scientist for a company (part of the R&amp;amp;D team).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been with this company for about two years, and initially, everything seemed to be going well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, the organization (both in terms of projects and the team) started to fall apart: pointless meetings, lack of clarity, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After several months, I realized that the main problem is the manager of the R&amp;amp;D department, who, frankly speaking, does not understand anything about the technical side (starting from the programming language used and more).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has caused me a sense of discomfort that makes me consider leaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last straw was the assignment of a training course: initially, we were asked to choose a topic for a course (not necessarily related to the role, and in my case, I chose concepts of Data Engineering and frameworks like Airflow).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without saying anything, this manager assigned a course to all of us, Data Scientists, and what did she assign us?
