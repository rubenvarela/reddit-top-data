Mostly 2,5\" USB/external, but 3 or 4 are just regular 3,5\" SATA drives.\n\nNever worried too much to look at SMART data until last week one of them started making funny \"click-like\" noises when I connect it to the PC. Makes 4 or 5 clicks and then it goes silent and data can be accessed as usual. Weird. And most probably a bad sign. Very bad sign.\n\nSince the the disk appears to be imminent to fail, I immediately thought of transferring the data to another disk. But before that I decided to check the clicking unit with smartctl, Linux cli utility.  \nPlease find below SMART data for that particular disk which to be fair is already some good \\~10 years old.\n\nAnd to rescue the data I decided to go with the most recent disk I have laying around which is a WD Blue 1TB drive that I think I bought in 2016. New at time of buying. Now 7 years old drive.\n\nPlease note that both drives have very little usage. Both have been stored in a drawer for most of their lifetime.\n\nI was basically shocked when looking at the SMART data. There's \"pre fail\" written all over the place on both drives.\n\nSo I went out to a local major reseller and bought 2 brand new Seagate SkyHawk 2TB 5400RPM 256MB SATA III. Yes, I know these drives were designed with surveillance in mind but those were the best deal I could find around for two 2TB 3,5\" SATA drives. I just had to solve my problem. I would deal with the details later.\n\nSo, I got home, connected both drives to my Pi server, ran a smartctl on it and...yep, lots of \"pre fail\" warnings.  \nSo...what the heck am I doing wrong? Where can I learn to properly interpret SMART reports? Looking at both my disks' reports, am I in trouble? Or the disks are fine'ish? Is it normal that a new disk reports pre fails??\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCheers  \n\n\n    SMART - clicking drive\n    \n    rcorreia@pi3srv:~ $ cat smart_toshiba.txt

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of disks at home. Mostly 2,5&amp;quot; USB/external, but 3 or 4 are just regular 3,5&amp;quot; SATA drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never worried too much to look at SMART data until last week one of them started making funny &amp;quot;click-like&amp;quot; noises when I connect it to the PC. Makes 4 or 5 clicks and then it goes silent and data can be accessed as usual. Weird. And most probably a bad sign. Very bad sign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the the disk appears to be imminent to fail, I immediately thought of transferring the data to another disk. But before that I decided to check the clicking unit with smartctl, Linux cli utility.&lt;br/&gt;\nPlease find below SMART data for that particular disk which to be fair is already some good ~10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to rescue the data I decided to go with the most recent disk I have laying around which is a WD Blue 1TB drive that I think I bought in 2016. New at time of buying. Now 7 years old drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that both drives have very little usage. Both have been stored in a drawer for most of their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was basically shocked when looking at the SMART data. There&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;pre fail&amp;quot; written all over the place on both drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went out to a local major reseller and bought 2 brand new Seagate SkyHawk 2TB 5400RPM 256MB SATA III. Yes, I know these drives were designed with surveillance in mind but those were the best deal I could find around for two 2TB 3,5&amp;quot; SATA drives. I just had to solve my problem. I would deal with the details later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I got home, connected both drives to my Pi server, ran a smartctl on it and...yep, lots of &amp;quot;pre fail&amp;quot; warnings.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo...what the heck am I doing wrong? Where can I learn to properly interpret SMART reports? Looking at both my disks&amp;#39; reports, am I in trouble? Or the disks are fine&amp;#39;ish? Is it normal that a new disk reports pre fails??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SMART - clicking drive\n\nrcorreia@pi3srv:~

I installed Truenas Core on the 870 Evo, and other than not being able to see the 980 M.2 in Truenas, which I thought was odd but didn't mind, everything worked fine for a year.\n\n**What might have caused it**\n\n**Upgrading to Truenas Scale** \\- One of the reasons I went with that Intel processor was for Quicksync transcoding, but I quickly realized Truenas Core didn't support that. For the first year, I was too scared to migrate to Scale, but last month I decided to give it a try. I upgraded and everything went great, I was able to set up Plex, get hardware transcoding, **and to my surprise even my missing 980 M.2 finally showed up!**\n\n**Deciding to use my newly rediscovered M.2** \\- Since that oddly missing M.2 finally showed up I decided why not save some drive space and get some performance gains by running my apps on it instead of running them on my HDD pool. So I adopted it, made it it's own pool, and set up all my apps on it.\n\n**What went wrong**\n\nI did all of that in a 1 week period and everything seemed to work fine. Then one day I logged in to Truenas and noticed a notification saying I was having read/write errors on a drive in my pool. This seemed odd because those drives are 1 year old, but I chalked it up to a fluke, RMA'd the drive, and replaced it.\n\nOnce I got the drive I marked it as offline, waited, replaced the new drive, and attempted to adopt the new drive as a replacement. But each time I've tried to do that it seems to have read/write errors and the replacement fails.\n\nI highly doubt the new drive is also broken, and I have a few theories, but I'm hoping someone can maybe give me a lead or help me figure out how to isolate the issue so I can save some time and money.\n\n**Possible causes/solutions?**\n\n* **Replace the PCIe Sata card with an HBA** \\- I've read some posts that those PCI Sata cards can possibly cause issues and that an HBA is a better fit.

I installed Truenas Core on the 870 Evo, and other than not being able to see the 980 M.2 in Truenas, which I thought was odd but didn&amp;#39;t mind, everything worked fine for a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What might have caused it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrading to Truenas Scale&lt;/strong&gt; - One of the reasons I went with that Intel processor was for Quicksync transcoding, but I quickly realized Truenas Core didn&amp;#39;t support that. For the first year, I was too scared to migrate to Scale, but last month I decided to give it a try. I upgraded and everything went great, I was able to set up Plex, get hardware transcoding, &lt;strong&gt;and to my surprise even my missing 980 M.2 finally showed up!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deciding to use my newly rediscovered M.2&lt;/strong&gt; - Since that oddly missing M.2 finally showed up I decided why not save some drive space and get some performance gains by running my apps on it instead of running them on my HDD pool. So I adopted it, made it it&amp;#39;s own pool, and set up all my apps on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What went wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did all of that in a 1 week period and everything seemed to work fine. Then one day I logged in to Truenas and noticed a notification saying I was having read/write errors on a drive in my pool. This seemed odd because those drives are 1 year old, but I chalked it up to a fluke, RMA&amp;#39;d the drive, and replaced it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I got the drive I marked it as offline, waited, replaced the new drive, and attempted to adopt the new drive as a replacement. But each time I&amp;#39;ve tried to do that it seems to have read/write errors and the replacement fails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I highly doubt the new drive is also broken, and I have a few theories, but I&amp;#39;m hoping someone can maybe give me a lead or help me figure out how to isolate the issue so I can save some time and money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible causes/solutions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace the PCIe Sata card with an HBA&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#39;ve read some posts that those PCI Sata cards can possibly cause issues and that an HBA is a better fit. I&amp;#39;m perfectly fine going this route, but I&amp;#39;d like to be more certain before I spend $100 and a few weeks waiting on one on from Ebay just to realize it wasn&amp;#39;t my issue.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lane issues with the M.2&lt;/strong&gt; - Maybe the reason the M.2 wasn&amp;#39;t originally available was because the lane was shared with either the PCIe or the SATA ports, and now that I&amp;#39;m using it that&amp;#39;s causing issues with the drives somehow.

My best network share uses drivepool to tier storage as 500gb nvme &gt; 500gb SSD &gt; 3x5tb SMR in raid 5.\n\nTrueNas seems really cool but not an option due to mix of drives and slow capacity upgrade plans, and at least from what I can tell, unraid doesn't have the ability to do tiered storage like I want, or fundamentally doesn't need it? I've been diving into a whole lot of research about it and it's all still a bit of a mess.\n\nEssentially what I was hoping for is to have all 12 spinners in a singe parity array, and upgrade that to dual parity as I can afford more 8tb drives, with another array of 4x2tb or 4x4tb 2.5\" SSD's as an SSD tier in single parity as well, and I was hoping that unraid would be able to promote frequently accessed data onto the SSD's for faster access over 10 gig.\n\nBut, it seems windows storage spaces is the only solution that heatmaps data, tracks when it was accessed and shuffles it around? I was hoping to do something other than windows server as a change this time around, and maybe the mover plugin can kind of help but it seems like it would be more a manual thing?\n\nIt sounds like from what I've read, L2ARC won't act quite like how I want, if I open up a months p;d project with 500gb-1tb of raw video files to edit it, it doesn't sound like L2ARC can actually handle that or many large files in general and it will still run off the spinnersl? Correct me if I'm wrong because that would be great\n\nThe other downside to L@ARC is it's invisible, you don't actually get that capacity, since it's only a cache and not tiered storage. The other option would just be two network shares, one SSD and one spinners, which would work, but doesn't have the magic automatic data shuffling that I think would be really cool and useful. That being said, with 12 3.5\" platters, I should be able to saturate 10 gig with fairly large files, but just not as great performance with smaller stuff.\n\nI'm still on the fence, I might just have this machine fired up when I'm working with my cinema camera footage and video projects, turning it off when not needed to save power, that was the original plan, but maybe starting to fully move over from my old solution, then hopefully in several months I can replace the dl380 g6 with something newer/more power efficient, with gpu capability.\n\nSo....

I was hoping to do something other than windows server as a change this time around, and maybe the mover plugin can kind of help but it seems like it would be more a manual thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like from what I&amp;#39;ve read, L2ARC won&amp;#39;t act quite like how I want, if I open up a months p;d project with 500gb-1tb of raw video files to edit it, it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like L2ARC can actually handle that or many large files in general and it will still run off the spinnersl? Correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong because that would be great&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other downside to L@ARC is it&amp;#39;s invisible, you don&amp;#39;t actually get that capacity, since it&amp;#39;s only a cache and not tiered storage. The other option would just be two network shares, one SSD and one spinners, which would work, but doesn&amp;#39;t have the magic automatic data shuffling that I think would be really cool and useful. That being said, with 12 3.5&amp;quot; platters, I should be able to saturate 10 gig with fairly large files, but just not as great performance with smaller stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still on the fence, I might just have this machine fired up when I&amp;#39;m working with my cinema camera footage and video projects, turning it off when not needed to save power, that was the original plan, but maybe starting to fully move over from my old solution, then hopefully in several months I can replace the dl380 g6 with something newer/more power efficient, with gpu capability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So.... I need some help making my mind up and I guess my efforts to keep this short didn&amp;#39;t really work :/&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "268afdf0-4bf8-11e3-be37-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "My backups are on floppies.", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17emxcr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "XOIIO", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17emxcr/unraidstorage_spaces_tiered_storage_is_windows/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17emxcr/unraidstorage_spaces_tiered_storage_is_windows/", "subreddit_subscribers": 708337, "created_utc": 1698074452.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "I had a raid5 3x 2TB WD red in 2nd pc, due to hdd failure in my personal PC I moved the raid5 in my personal pc.
