In the past, I did backups in this manner:\n\n* Inside the home server, there were two HDDs - a main one, and a backup one. I manually ran rsync every now and then to copy over data to the backup drive.\n* Additionally, there were two HDDs in external 3.5\" drive enclosures. One of them I placed off-site. That way, at some point, I copied over data from the backup drive with rsync to the external drive that I had at home, and then went to the off-site location to swap external drives.\n\nI am now upgrading the drives and Debian itself, and as part of that, I also want a smarter backup solution. I think I'll keep the rsync based approach for the external drives, since these I always run manually anyway. And that way, I can always fully access the data - I am not risking data loss due to corruption in some backup tool specific archives / images / snapshots. I think it is a good idea to not use the same backup tool and format for _all_ drives. If there's corruption due to a backup tool bug, then at least the external drives can still be accessed, and data loss is migitated.\n\nAlso, I use btrfs on all drives mainly for its checksum feature, on top of LUKS.\n\nWhat I want to specifically change is what I do with the internal backup drive. For *that* I want to move towards an automated solution with versioning.\n\nHowever, there are three questions that I haven't found answers to yet.\n\nFirst, in the past, I rsync'd the contents of the _backup_ drive to external drives, and not the contents of the main drive. The reason for that was that I wanted to offload some of the IO load. The main drive is getting used the most of all of the drives already. By first rsync'ing the main drive contents to the internal backup drive, and then from the internal backup drive to the external drive, I hoped to reduce IO on the main disk (since the internal drives are closer in sync than an internal and an external drive are). If I use an actual backup tool, this means that I somehow have to rsync the contents of the backup tool specific archive/image/snapshot. I suppose one way to do that would be to be able to mount the archive/image/snapshot in Linux?\n\nSecond, it seems to me that relying on LUKS to do the encryption is more secure and robust since LUKS is much more tested than any custom made encryption by a backup tool. Would you agree?\n\nThird, I am still researching what backup tool is best suited for me. I do not need any cloud backup support, or anything that isn't local for that matter. As said, off-site backups I do by transporting the physical external disk anyway. My constraints are (a) reliability and (b) resource consumption. For (a), if there is corruption in the archive/image/snapshot, it must not cause total loss of the backup. For (b), I use a Supermicro mainboard with an Intel Atom C3558, and the machine has 16 GB ECC RAM. I do not want a backup solution that is extremely RAM hungry. I have about 10 TB of data and &gt; 4 million files.\n\nTo summarize what I do _not_ need:\n* Compression\n* Encryption (unless it really is better to use backup tool based encrypting instead of relying on LUKS)\n* Cloud storage support\n* Ability to use the same archive to backup data from multiple computers\n* Anything related to commercial licenses (this is for private use only)\n* Windows support (I only use Linux)\n\nThe main tools I found and looked at thus far:\n\n## Restic\n\nPro: Versioned snapshots, very popular, good performance.\n\nCon: Apparently, very high resource consumption with large datasets (see for example [here](https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-uses-more-than-4gb-ram-on-14gb-backup-than-crashes/4584), [here](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2519), or [here](https://forum.restic.net/t/high-memory-usage-on-backup-prune-and-check/1253)). This seems to be mainly caused by Go's garbage collector, which needs finetuning (see the `GOGC=20` recommendatins).\n\nWith regards to reliability, I found [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16rnnji/comment/k26i0p5/) about data corruption, but this seems to have been caused by RAM corruption. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/f40fa2/restic_alternative_for_backups/) is more worrisome, but it is also 4 years old. Same applies to [this one](https://forum.restic.net/t/recovery-options-for-damaged-repositories/1571). [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/169tawo/comment/jz3ss6e/) claims that Restic does not have bit rot protection, but according to [this](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1620), Restic does use SHA256 and stores the checksum in blob filenames.\n\n## Borg\n\nPro: Versioned snapshots, also very popular, seems very mature. Did not find any RAM usage issues. Well established ecosystem from what I've seen.\n\nCon: Unclear about performance. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/izq0mo/comment/g9jmqak/) claims that larger datasets like mine would cause Borg to be very slow - but, it is 3 years old.\n\nAlso, I am not sure about a Python based solution. It does come with a large amounts of Python library dependencies, and I am typically skeptical about using a dynamically typed language for software that must be rock solid and highly reliable. But Borg has been around for a long time, so I am less worried about bugs.\n\n## Duplicacy\n\nPro: No need for a special index database. The chunks are placed in the file system. [This](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Lock-Free-Deduplication) explains it in greater detail. Seems to place great emphasis on reliability, which is important for me. Versioning is also supported.\n\nCon: Apparently, much less popular than Restic or Borg - I had a harder time researching about experiences others have had with it. And, similar to Restic, RAM usage seems to be potentially a problem. I found [this post](https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/memory-usage/623) that states: \"The memory usage is highly related to the number of files to be backed up. Duplicacy loads the entire file list into the memory during the indexing phase so you may run out of memory if there are too many files.\" With &gt;4 million files, this worries me. But, this is an old post. [This post](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/3401965/#Comment_3401965) also reports high RAM usage, but indicates that my file count could be handled with 16 GB RAM.\n\nI also briefly looked at Kopia. Overall quite interesting, with very good performance, but I am unsure about its reliability. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/tz0ad6/kopia_vs_borg/) (which admittely is 2 years old) did not inspire confidence. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/16rnnji/comment/k24e70x/) however is much more recent, and also rather alarming.\n\nThus far, my favorite is Duplicacy due to it not needing a special index database and putting such emphasis on reliability. Close second is Borg due to its maturity and ecosystem.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "author_fullname": "t2_v3szwqll", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Researching what to use for purely local Linux home server backup (no cloud backups)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DataHoarder", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "backup", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17ec8s3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Backup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1698035663.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.DataHoarder", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a DIY home server that runs Debian 11 (upgrading to Debian 12 at the moment).

I installed Truenas Core on the 870 Evo, and other than not being able to see the 980 M.2 in Truenas, which I thought was odd but didn't mind, everything worked fine for a year.\n\n**What might have caused it**\n\n**Upgrading to Truenas Scale** \\- One of the reasons I went with that Intel processor was for Quicksync transcoding, but I quickly realized Truenas Core didn't support that. For the first year, I was too scared to migrate to Scale, but last month I decided to give it a try. I upgraded and everything went great, I was able to set up Plex, get hardware transcoding, **and to my surprise even my missing 980 M.2 finally showed up!**\n\n**Deciding to use my newly rediscovered M.2** \\- Since that oddly missing M.2 finally showed up I decided why not save some drive space and get some performance gains by running my apps on it instead of running them on my HDD pool. So I adopted it, made it it's own pool, and set up all my apps on it.\n\n**What went wrong**\n\nI did all of that in a 1 week period and everything seemed to work fine. Then one day I logged in to Truenas and noticed a notification saying I was having read/write errors on a drive in my pool. This seemed odd because those drives are 1 year old, but I chalked it up to a fluke, RMA'd the drive, and replaced it.\n\nOnce I got the drive I marked it as offline, waited, replaced the new drive, and attempted to adopt the new drive as a replacement. But each time I've tried to do that it seems to have read/write errors and the replacement fails.\n\nI highly doubt the new drive is also broken, and I have a few theories, but I'm hoping someone can maybe give me a lead or help me figure out how to isolate the issue so I can save some time and money.\n\n**Possible causes/solutions?**\n\n* **Replace the PCIe Sata card with an HBA** \\- I've read some posts that those PCI Sata cards can possibly cause issues and that an HBA is a better fit. I'm perfectly fine going this route, but I'd like to be more certain before I spend $100 and a few weeks waiting on one on from Ebay just to realize it wasn't my issue.\n* **Lane issues with the M.2** \\- Maybe the reason the M.2 wasn't originally available was because the lane was shared with either the PCIe or the SATA ports, and now that I'm using it that's causing issues with the drives somehow. I feel like I looked into this when I first set up the machine, but nothing in the manual I found seems to mention this.\n* **Something with the Truenas upgrade** \\- No idea what this would be, but maybe I just need to wipe the whole pool and re-sync it from my remote backup? Since I'm a drive down I did backup the pool to Backblaze B2 using Truenas Sync, but it's pretty pricey to store 8tb there and once my drives are back up I'd like to delete that.\n* **I'm unlucky and both drives are actually broken** \\- I think this is unlikely, and I ran S.M.A.R.T tests on the drive (long and short) and both of them succeeded, but I don't really know what that means or how to dive deeper.\n\nAny and all advice, guides, and resources are much appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e6d93df1031c1c1069ea55cb7a0566a848f98d\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author_fullname": "t2_vdoghsv", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What could be causing these drive errors in Truenas/ZFS?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/homelab", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "help", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 72, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"5q1j3kgvy0wb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 55, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d14a8bb2e1a5a46e85b432b1150b1f48c7f9f93"}, {"y": 111, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c346a35a4c2b19a9f4302c10783f544e4cc9bb82"}, {"y": 164, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf71eb2982b160861481c8ff42370214694e7160"}, {"y": 329, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c09bc06eab749a7ff875f62ef2e589eb5e2c08b8"}, {"y": 494, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eec5c311c7ae0fee5d21ea9fb3d6c3ca24e5962"}, {"y": 556, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6a1ab9f3e4ce37094d234c28b1f0459ed5bc84e"}], "s": {"y": 1780, "x": 3456, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e6d93df1031c1c1069ea55cb7a0566a848f98d"}, "id": "5q1j3kgvy0wb1"}}, "name": "t3_17ewi53", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Help", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7qyqqsDIcMzpzcupQS37uogqhMgEKsn7ESRpuChWHfg.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1698098596.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.homelab", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So about a year ago I built my own NAS/Media Server, it worked (mostly) fine at first, but now I&amp;#39;m getting read and write errors and the replacement drive is having the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intel Core i5-12400&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ASUS ROG STRIX B660-I&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.microcenter.com/product/383009/2-port_SATA_60Gb-s_PCIe_Controller_Card\"&gt;IOCrest 2-port SATA 6.0Gb/s PCIe Controller Card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5 WD Red 6TB NAS drives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SAMSUNG 980 M.2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Samsung 870 EVO&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the board only has 4 SATA ports, I added that SATA PCIe controller, connected 2 of the HDD&amp;#39;s to it, and 3 of the HDD&amp;#39;s and the 870 EVO to the motherboard.

Since I&amp;#39;m a drive down I did backup the pool to Backblaze B2 using Truenas Sync, but it&amp;#39;s pretty pricey to store 8tb there and once my drives are back up I&amp;#39;d like to delete that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m unlucky and both drives are actually broken&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this is unlikely, and I ran S.M.A.R.T tests on the drive (long and short) and both of them succeeded, but I don&amp;#39;t really know what that means or how to dive deeper.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any and all advice, guides, and resources are much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=3456&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=83e6d93df1031c1c1069ea55cb7a0566a848f98d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5q1j3kgvy0wb1.jpg?width=3456&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=83e6d93df1031c1c1069ea55cb7a0566a848f98d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "664a26e4-322a-11e6-80ae-0e0378709321", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2ubz7", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff6347", "id": "17ewi53", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MattPetitt", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/homelab/comments/17ewi53/what_could_be_causing_these_drive_errors_in/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/17ewi53/what_could_be_causing_these_drive_errors_in/", "subreddit_subscribers": 607705, "created_utc": 1698098596.0, "num_crossposts": 3, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1698098751.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.homelab", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/homelab/comments/17ewi53/what_could_be_causing_these_drive_errors_in/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5b6d7a04-b94e-11eb-b676-0ed4dfcb172d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17ewk9n", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MattPetitt", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_17ewi53", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17ewk9n/what_could_be_causing_these_drive_errors_in/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/homelab/comments/17ewi53/what_could_be_causing_these_drive_errors_in/", "subreddit_subscribers": 708245, "created_utc": 1698098751.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI recently had a near-miss that has spurred me to raise my backup game.

The raid5 worked flawlesly in 2nd pc however in my personal PC I am having tons of issues.\n\nAll 3 drives have about 2900 power on hours, they all pass all tests I've done and they don't make any weird noise. However my PC just doesn't work anymore. The moment  I try to copy something onto raid5 or access something everything freezes and whole PC becomes sluggish.When copying something onto raid5 it starts at about 500MB/s transfer rates and after 10 seconds it drops speeds down to 250KB/s to max 4MB/s. That's also when PC gets sluggish, everything stops responding and just takes forever to load.\n\nIt's an older system with i7-2600k but CPU doesn't get over 10% utilisation, 32GB of ram, again only like 30% used. SSD is at 1% (where im copying from), raid5 HDD is pinned at 100%. The issue stays even after everything is finished copying. Disk stays at 100% for hours and even if I try to shutdown or restart PC, the PC is frozen on \"restarting\" or \"shutting down\" for that period of time. If I leave the PC idle, the raid5 eventually drops to 0% and I can use PC normaly again.\n\nI've been searching internet and reddit for a few days now without any results of a problem like this.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbey7hu2oyvb1.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef5c0e8eff8b7122ff0945fafcbf9b89dadf4b3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkzu4au2oyvb1.png?width=871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42f595a246aa1a507491929b4d82449e57d0ea4f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzi2pbu2oyvb1.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90ea9cd105fb6322f415b7c93bf1f513d718795b",

moved the raid5 in my personal pc. The raid5 worked flawlesly in 2nd pc however in my personal PC I am having tons of issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All 3 drives have about 2900 power on hours, they all pass all tests I&amp;#39;ve done and they don&amp;#39;t make any weird noise. However my PC just doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore. The moment  I try to copy something onto raid5 or access something everything freezes and whole PC becomes sluggish.When copying something onto raid5 it starts at about 500MB/s transfer rates and after 10 seconds it drops speeds down to 250KB/s to max 4MB/s. That&amp;#39;s also when PC gets sluggish, everything stops responding and just takes forever to load.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an older system with i7-2600k but CPU doesn&amp;#39;t get over 10% utilisation, 32GB of ram, again only like 30% used. SSD is at 1% (where im copying from), raid5 HDD is pinned at 100%. The issue stays even after everything is finished copying. Disk stays at 100% for hours and even if I try to shutdown or restart PC, the PC is frozen on &amp;quot;restarting&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;shutting down&amp;quot; for that period of time. If I leave the PC idle, the raid5 eventually drops to 0% and I can use PC normaly again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been searching internet and reddit for a few days now without any results of a problem like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cbey7hu2oyvb1.png?width=1339&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8ef5c0e8eff8b7122ff0945fafcbf9b89dadf4b3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cbey7hu2oyvb1.png?width=1339&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8ef5c0e8eff8b7122ff0945fafcbf9b89dadf4b3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jkzu4au2oyvb1.png?width=871&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42f595a246aa1a507491929b4d82449e57d0ea4f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jkzu4au2oyvb1.png?width=871&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42f595a246aa1a507491929b4d82449e57d0ea4f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tzi2pbu2oyvb1.png?width=674&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=90ea9cd105fb6322f415b7c93bf1f513d718795b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tzi2pbu2oyvb1.png?width=674&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=90ea9cd105fb6322f415b7c93bf1f513d718795b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "5b6d7a04-b94e-11eb-b676-0ed4dfcb172d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2x7he", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "17eljj1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Don_Lenkas", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/DataHoarder/comments/17eljj1/raid5_issues_with_pc/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/17eljj1/raid5_issues_with_pc/", "subreddit_subscribers": 708245, "created_utc": 1698070839.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "selftext": "Greetings,\n\nAfter my last 7 years old HDD died (vibrations from living right above the metro in Milan for some months are the main suspect tbh) I moved to SSDs, not much for speed, but majorly for supposedly higher reliability; for the last 2 years my system was entirely reliant on SSDs, with just one hard drive for a second copy of important data.
