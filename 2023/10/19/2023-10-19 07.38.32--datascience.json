Oftentimes the advice I see here is from people without DS jobs trying to help other people without DS jobs on projects etc. It's more or less blind leading the blind.\n\nHere's an insider perspective from me. I'm a hiring manager at an F50 financial services company you've probably heard of, I've been working for \\~4 years and I'll share how entry-level roles actually get hired into.\n\nThere's a few different pathways. I've listed them in order of where the bulk of our candidate pool and current hires comes from\n\n1. We pick MS students from very specific programs that we trust. These programs have been around for a while, we have a relationship with the school and have a good idea of the curriculum. Georgia Tech, Columbia, UVa, UC Berkeley, UW Seattle, NCSU are some universities we hire from. We don't come back every year to hire, just the years that we need positions filled. Sometimes you'll look around at teams here and 40% of them went to the same program. They're stellar hires. The programs that we hire from are incredibly competitive to get into, are not diploma mills, and most importantly, their programs have been around longer than the DS hype. How does the hiring process work? We just reach out to the career counselor at the school, they put out an interest list for students who want to work for us, we flip through the resumes and pick the students we like to interview. It's very streamlined both for us as an employer and for the student. Although I didn't come from this path (I was a referred by a friend during the hiring boom and just have a PhD), I'm actively involved in the hiring efforts.\n2. We host hackathons every year for students to participate in. The winners of these hackathons typically get brought back to interview for internship positions, and if they perform well we pick them up as full time hires.\n3. Generic career fairs at universities. If you go a to a university, you've probably seen career fairs with companies that come to recruit.\n4. Referrals from our current employees. Typically they refer a candidate to us, we interview them, and if we like them, we'll punt them over to the recruiter to get the process started for hiring them. Typically the hiring manager has seen the resume before the recruiter has because the resume came straight to their inbox from one of their colleagues\n5. Internal mobility of someone who shows promise but just needs an opportunity. We've already worked with them in some capacity, know them to be bright, and are willing to give them a shot even if they don't have the skills.\n6. Far and away the worst and hardest way to get a job, our recruiter sends us their resume after screening candidates who applied online through the job portal. Our recruiters know more or less what to look for (I'm thankful ours are not trash)\n\nThis is true not just for our company but most large companies broadly. I know Home Depot, Microsoft and few other large retail companies some of my network works at hire candidates this way.\n\nIs it fair to the general population? No. But as employees at a company we have limited resources to put into finding quality candidates and we typically use pathways that we know work, and work well in generating high quality hires.", "author_fullname": "t2_j65u2bg31", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Where are all the entry level jobs?

My name is Neo. I have studies in University of Waterloo and got a bachelor of statistics (It's not that \"computer-science-coop\" program so I think my degree is not very good), I didnt take my courses too seriously and my GPA is just 3.0 when I graduated. \n\nAfter I graduated from college I took several courses in coursera and taught myself a bit of SQL, SAS, python and powerbi. Unsurprisingly, this kind of qualifications are insufficient to get myself a proper junior data analyst, engineer or scientist role (not that there is a lot of such jobs to begin with). In the end, I only got a data entry job with meager wage in a small company after spending 4 months on hiring sites. The contract last for 1 year. I probably deserve this position for the opportunity I have wasted in college, but I am definitely not satisfied.\n\nI want to be not obly a qualified data analyst/scientist, but someone good enough to be somewhat competitive in the canadian job market by the end of next year. I am ready to go to hell and back for that.\n\nI probably won't be able to go back to school due to my bad GPA and my work, so I am ready to take online programs, read books, do projects, get certifications, and anything else (within legal boundaries, of course). \n\nAfter did some research (and consulting with gpt), I think I should at the very least at several courses on coursera, finish several projects on kaggle, get mid level SAS certification, and a good project with my company's data(within legal boundaries, again). However based on several posts here it seems SAS are not so useful anymore and kaggle are just filler for resume, I might need to change my plan a bit.\n\n\nSo, sorry for all the ranting above, do you have any recommendations or step to step guide to help me achieve my goal?", "author_fullname": "t2_5szfquyr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Recommend steps to be hired as a data scientist?
