I love my job, my boss, and my team. I work as a data analyst, mostly doing data visualization. Lately my boss has been bringing me into more ad hoc analyst asks, which I have enjoyed. I\u2019m also wrapping up my Master\u2019s in Computer Science in Spring \u201824. My career change from biz management to data analytics/CS is all but complete. \n\nAnyways, I moved down to Florida for my first job with this company in the midst of the lockdown in 2020. Since then, I\u2019ve been in office maybe 10-12 times between both jobs. This job I actually applied for internally was listed as fully remote, but changed me to local because I was here. Didn\u2019t love that. I think it\u2019s fair to say however that my team works best remote. My direct boss I think strongly aligns with how I feel, as does our Sr Engineer. We also have two junior analysts - one of which is truly remote because he was hired and lives in the Midwest. He is formerly of Florida. So there\u2019s precedent on our team.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently gotten a new CEO. He spoke highly of hybrid work and hinted at imposing a 3 day a week mandate next year. For now, he\u2019s \u201cencouraging\u201d us to come in. He\u2019s pro hybrid, but not pro fully remote. I have been remote the last five years of my professional career. It\u2019s what works for me. I never want to sit in an office. I will come in bi weekly, quarterly, as needed. But I am building dashboards and doing ad hoc analytics. There\u2019s no need to sit next to my team. We communicate fine via Slack. When I work in office - I lost 2 hours of sleep, don\u2019t have time or energy for grad school at night, am just generally miserable. So far its been a non-issue, but our CEO has heightened my anxiety. My sole piece of leverage is I basically own our entire BI platform. It would be hard to replace me on a whim.\n\nWe\u2019re currently in our \u201cpeak\u201d season. Everyone\u2019s swamped and stressed - especially my boss. But I\u2019m losing sleep over this. And to make matters more complicated, I want to move out of Florida when my lease is up next May. I\u2019d like to move to the Midwest in a state we also operate in. I am miserable in Florida and lonely here. I miss being near any semblance of family. I don\u2019t like the climate, weather and politically. I just can\u2019t stand it. \n\nIm just looking for advice when to talk to my boss and how to professionally discuss this request. My anxiety has me prepared for the worst. We speak weekly in one on ones but it\u2019s usually all time for actual work. I try not to rock the boat or be difficult, but being remote is the most important thing to me. Part of me think ya it\u2019s best to wait for peak to end, the other part of me thinks I shouldn\u2019t have to live with the anxiety. I\u2019m glad she at least seems aligned with me on preferring remote, and I originally planned to speak with her in august when we do our yearly bonus/career conversation, but that was moved company wide to January. I\u2019m just tired of constantly hearing about the office, office surveys, etc. I think our CEO was speaking generally vs specifically to me and my team but I hate the lack of certainty.

I love my job, my boss, and my team. I work as a data analyst, mostly doing data visualization. Lately my boss has been bringing me into more ad hoc analyst asks, which I have enjoyed. I\u2019m also wrapping up my Master\u2019s in Computer Science in Spring \u201824. My career change from biz management to data analytics/CS is all but complete. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I moved down to Florida for my first job with this company in the midst of the lockdown in 2020. Since then, I\u2019ve been in office maybe 10-12 times between both jobs. This job I actually applied for internally was listed as fully remote, but changed me to local because I was here. Didn\u2019t love that. I think it\u2019s fair to say however that my team works best remote. My direct boss I think strongly aligns with how I feel, as does our Sr Engineer. We also have two junior analysts - one of which is truly remote because he was hired and lives in the Midwest. He is formerly of Florida. So there\u2019s precedent on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve recently gotten a new CEO. He spoke highly of hybrid work and hinted at imposing a 3 day a week mandate next year. For now, he\u2019s \u201cencouraging\u201d us to come in. He\u2019s pro hybrid, but not pro fully remote. I have been remote the last five years of my professional career. It\u2019s what works for me. I never want to sit in an office. I will come in bi weekly, quarterly, as needed. But I am building dashboards and doing ad hoc analytics. There\u2019s no need to sit next to my team. We communicate fine via Slack. When I work in office - I lost 2 hours of sleep, don\u2019t have time or energy for grad school at night, am just generally miserable. So far its been a non-issue, but our CEO has heightened my anxiety. My sole piece of leverage is I basically own our entire BI platform. It would be hard to replace me on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re currently in our \u201cpeak\u201d season. Everyone\u2019s swamped and stressed - especially my boss. But I\u2019m losing sleep over this. And to make matters more complicated, I want to move out of Florida when my lease is up next May. I\u2019d like to move to the Midwest in a state we also operate in. I am miserable in Florida and lonely here. I miss being near any semblance of family. I don\u2019t like the climate, weather and politically. I just can\u2019t stand it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im just looking for advice when to talk to my boss and how to professionally discuss this request. My anxiety has me prepared for the worst. We speak weekly in one on ones but it\u2019s usually all time for actual work. I try not to rock the boat or be difficult, but being remote is the most important thing to me. Part of me think ya it\u2019s best to wait for peak to end, the other part of me thinks I shouldn\u2019t have to live with the anxiety. I\u2019m glad she at least seems aligned with me on preferring remote, and I originally planned to speak with her in august when we do our yearly bonus/career conversation, but that was moved company wide to January. I\u2019m just tired of constantly hearing about the office, office surveys, etc. I think our CEO was speaking generally vs specifically to me and my team but I hate the lack of certainty. I just cannot do the office and all the social and financial drain that comes with it - especially since I am so high performing. Before I was hired, we had this project contracted to a consulting firm where 3 people did my job. We\u2019ve completely streamlined it since. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17bjomh", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Potential-Vehicle-25", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17bjomh/i_work_as_an_analystdata_viz_and_am_wondering_how/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17bjomh/i_work_as_an_analystdata_viz_and_am_wondering_how/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1091030, "created_utc": 1697723586.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Would be interesting to hear what you used to generate the metric , what \u201cmath\u201d you used, what signals it gave the business and what did / did not work well", "author_fullname": "t2_32eyna18", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Anyone here develop a customer health score / index to support product management at a SaaS company and really product led growth ?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17bbisz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1697692983.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would be interesting to hear what you used to generate the metric , what \u201cmath\u201d you used, what signals it gave the business and what did / did not work well&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17bbisz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "acceptedcitizen", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17bbisz/anyone_here_develop_a_customer_health_score_index/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17bbisz/anyone_here_develop_a_customer_health_score_index/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1091030, "created_utc": 1697692983.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "\nIn the ever so growing lexicon of data science;

And thus,\u00a0[**Julia**](https://julialang.org/)\u00a0was born (here\u2019s a manifesto explaining\u00a0[**why**](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/)\u00a0in more detail). Its first version was launched a bit more than eleven years ago.\n\n## Our choice\n\nMany in-depth comparisons of Python and Julia on the web (such as\u00a0[**this one**](https://richardpelgrim.medium.com/julia-vs-python-for-data-science-in-2022-1f5f6f38f3ac)\u00a0or\u00a0[**this**](https://www.turing.com/kb/julia-vs-python)) cover both the objective and subjective benefits and drawbacks of choosing one over the other. And given Julia\u2019s growing popularity, we are sure more will follow. In the rest of this blog post, however, let\u2019s explore why we picked Julia for our purposes. And that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t use Python for data science. On the contrary, we\u00a0**often run analyses in both ecosystems simultaneously**\u00a0to help each other out where one is lacking or to reduce the chances of mistakes by comparing their results.\n\n## The advantages of Julia\n\nSo what makes Julia so compelling to us?\n\n## Language features\n\nJulia has:\n\n* a friendly, easy-to-read (and write) syntax;\n* \u00a0a flexible and expressive (part static, part dynamic) type system;\n* \u00a0powerful mathematical notations, such as built-in vector and matrix operations;\n* \u00a0efficient\u00a0[**multiple dispatches**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch), a form of function polymorphism working with runtime types;\n* \u00a0convenient and reliable parallel computing facilities;\n* \u00a0meta-programming with macros and generated functions.\n\n## Fast code execution\n\nJulia compiles the source code to\u00a0**native binary at runtime**\u00a0via LLVM. This approach combines the flexibility of interpreters, such as Python, with the performance of compiled languages, like C++ or Rust. The drawback is that code loading and the first run takes longer;\u00a0**the benefits start to shine when a piece of code is run multiple times**. This unique feature makes it an excellent tool for number crunching but less than ideal for scripting.\n\n## Built-in package management\n\nJulia has a pretty good (albeit not perfect) built-in package management tool, implemented as a base library; and a general registry of open-source packages. The offering of\u00a0**stable and well-designed packages**\u00a0is growing steadily along with the Julia community, especially in data science. Unit testing utilities are also part of the standard library.\n\n## Interactive tools\n\nJulia offers an\u00a0**advanced**\u00a0[**REPL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)\u00a0with all the goodies of an interpreted language environment. These include:\n\n* code and variable inspection,\n* \u00a0code completion,\n* \u00a0an interactive debugger,\n* \u00a0benchmarking and profiling tools,\n* \u00a0and a built-in help system.\n\n**With third-party libraries, it can also be extended**\u00a0with\u00a0[**syntax highlighting**](https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl),\u00a0[**source code lookup**](https://github.com/tkf/InteractiveCodeSearch.jl)\u00a0(even for base libraries), automatic\u00a0[**code reload**](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/), and many more exciting, modern features.\n\nAll these together make Julia an\u00a0**ideal environment for rapid prototyping**.\n\n## From prototyping to production code\n\nBecause of the high-level interactive tools and fast code execution,\u00a0**the transition from a rapid prototype to production-ready code can be as continuous as you\u2019d like**. More often than not, we find that most of the code that implements our business logic in the research code can also be used in the final product.\n\nThanks to its friendly syntax and built-in package management,\u00a0**the road to maintainable code is well paved**. Nothing replaces good API design, coding discipline, and rigorous testing, but Julia helps you to focus on these topics.\n\nAs a consequence, a computation pieced together in the REPL can easily become a piece of prototyping code in a POC module; then later, after some refactoring and unit testing, turn into a chunk of core code in an internal library, and finally, following more cleanup, find itself in a production package.\n\n## The disadvantages of Julia\n\nThat said, every benefit comes at a cost, and Julia is not free from issues. Here are a few stumbling blocks worthy of mentioning:\n\n* the very powerful tool of broadcasting and vectorization can be intimidating at first;\n* [**time to first plot**](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/time-to-first-plot-clarification/58534)\u00a0can be surprising, sometimes inconveniently long, although considerable effort has been put into making it shorter;\n* \u00a0many packages never reach a stable state or just become unmaintained; others are poorly designed or written;\n* [**releasing a binary package**](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl)\u00a0can be challenging, and compilation time can be unexpectedly long, not to mention obfuscation, which can also be tricky.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn conclusion, the choice between programming languages for data analysis is not always clear-cut. While Python has been the go-to language for many data scientists, Julia is rapidly gaining popularity for its unique set of features that make it an attractive option. In this blog post, we explored why we chose Julia over Python for our purposes, highlighting its language features, fast code execution, built-in package management, interactive tools, and ease of transitioning from prototyping to production code. However, we also acknowledged that Julia has challenges, including overcoming some learning curves and the occasional instability of packages. Ultimately, the choice between Julia and Python (or any other programming language) will depend on specific project requirements, personal preferences, and available resources.\n\nStill, in the past years,\u00a0**Julia has proved to be our reliable and faithful companion**. It has evolved, matured, and improved significantly, and we would be less happy and less successful without it.

And that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t use Python for data science. On the contrary, we\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;often run analyses in both ecosystems simultaneously&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0to help each other out where one is lacking or to reduce the chances of mistakes by comparing their results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The advantages of Julia&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what makes Julia so compelling to us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Language features&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julia has:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a friendly, easy-to-read (and write) syntax;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0a flexible and expressive (part static, part dynamic) type system;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0powerful mathematical notations, such as built-in vector and matrix operations;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0efficient\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;multiple dispatches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a form of function polymorphism working with runtime types;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0convenient and reliable parallel computing facilities;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0meta-programming with macros and generated functions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Fast code execution&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julia compiles the source code to\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;native binary at runtime&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0via LLVM. This approach combines the flexibility of interpreters, such as Python, with the performance of compiled languages, like C++ or Rust. The drawback is that code loading and the first run takes longer;\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;the benefits start to shine when a piece of code is run multiple times&lt;/strong&gt;. This unique feature makes it an excellent tool for number crunching but less than ideal for scripting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Built-in package management&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julia has a pretty good (albeit not perfect) built-in package management tool, implemented as a base library; and a general registry of open-source packages. The offering of\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;stable and well-designed packages&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0is growing steadily along with the Julia community, especially in data science. Unit testing utilities are also part of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Interactive tools&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julia offers an\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;advanced&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with all the goodies of an interpreted language environment. These include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;code and variable inspection,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0code completion,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0an interactive debugger,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0benchmarking and profiling tools,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0and a built-in help system.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With third-party libraries, it can also be extended&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/tkf/InteractiveCodeSearch.jl\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;source code lookup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(even for base libraries), automatic\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;code reload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and many more exciting, modern features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All these together make Julia an\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;ideal environment for rapid prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;From prototyping to production code&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the high-level interactive tools and fast code execution,\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;the transition from a rapid prototype to production-ready code can be as continuous as you\u2019d like&lt;/strong&gt;. More often than not, we find that most of the code that implements our business logic in the research code can also be used in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its friendly syntax and built-in package management,\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;the road to maintainable code is well paved&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing replaces good API design, coding discipline, and rigorous testing, but Julia helps you to focus on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, a computation pieced together in the REPL can easily become a piece of prototyping code in a POC module; then later, after some refactoring and unit testing, turn into a chunk of core code in an internal library, and finally, following more cleanup, find itself in a production package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The disadvantages of Julia&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, every benefit comes at a cost, and Julia is not free from issues. Here are a few stumbling blocks worthy of mentioning:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the very powerful tool of broadcasting and vectorization can be intimidating at first;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/time-to-first-plot-clarification/58534\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;time to first plot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be surprising, sometimes inconveniently long, although considerable effort has been put into making it shorter;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0many packages never reach a stable state or just become unmaintained; others are poorly designed or written;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;releasing a binary package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be challenging, and compilation time can be unexpectedly long, not to mention obfuscation, which can also be tricky.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the choice between programming languages for data analysis is not always clear-cut. While Python has been the go-to language for many data scientists, Julia is rapidly gaining popularity for its unique set of features that make it an attractive option. In this blog post, we explored why we chose Julia over Python for our purposes, highlighting its language features, fast code execution, built-in package management, interactive tools, and ease of transitioning from prototyping to production code. However, we also acknowledged that Julia has challenges, including overcoming some learning curves and the occasional instability of packages. Ultimately, the choice between Julia and Python (or any other programming language) will depend on specific project requirements, personal preferences, and available resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, in the past years,\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;Julia has proved to be our reliable and faithful companion&lt;/strong&gt;. It has evolved, matured, and improved significantly, and we would be less happy and less successful without it. So cheers, Julia; we are excited to see what your future brings!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17bf3cx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CursorInsight", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17bf3cx/programming_language_for_machine_learning_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17bf3cx/programming_language_for_machine_learning_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1091030, "created_utc": 1697707699.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently writing my master thesis about gaze estimation and i am using a combination of a cnn for finding feature map and transformer for the regression task.
