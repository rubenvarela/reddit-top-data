Oftentimes the advice I see here is from people without DS jobs trying to help other people without DS jobs on projects etc. It's more or less blind leading the blind.\n\nHere's an insider perspective from me. I'm a hiring manager at an F50 financial services company you've probably heard of, I've been working for \\~4 years and I'll share how entry-level roles actually get hired into.\n\nThere's a few different pathways. I've listed them in order of where the bulk of our candidate pool and current hires comes from\n\n1. We pick MS students from very specific programs that we trust. These programs have been around for a while, we have a relationship with the school and have a good idea of the curriculum. Georgia Tech, Columbia, UVa, UC Berkeley, UW Seattle, NCSU are some universities we hire from. We don't come back every year to hire, just the years that we need positions filled. Sometimes you'll look around at teams here and 40% of them went to the same program. They're stellar hires. The programs that we hire from are incredibly competitive to get into, are not diploma mills, and most importantly, their programs have been around longer than the DS hype. How does the hiring process work? We just reach out to the career counselor at the school, they put out an interest list for students who want to work for us, we flip through the resumes and pick the students we like to interview. It's very streamlined both for us as an employer and for the student. Although I didn't come from this path (I was a referred by a friend during the hiring boom and just have a PhD), I'm actively involved in the hiring efforts.\n2. We host hackathons every year for students to participate in. The winners of these hackathons typically get brought back to interview for internship positions, and if they perform well we pick them up as full time hires.\n3. Generic career fairs at universities. If you go a to a university, you've probably seen career fairs with companies that come to recruit.\n4. Referrals from our current employees. Typically they refer a candidate to us, we interview them, and if we like them, we'll punt them over to the recruiter to get the process started for hiring them. Typically the hiring manager has seen the resume before the recruiter has because the resume came straight to their inbox from one of their colleagues\n5. Internal mobility of someone who shows promise but just needs an opportunity. We've already worked with them in some capacity, know them to be bright, and are willing to give them a shot even if they don't have the skills.\n6. Far and away the worst and hardest way to get a job, our recruiter sends us their resume after screening candidates who applied online through the job portal. Our recruiters know more or less what to look for (I'm thankful ours are not trash)\n\nThis is true not just for our company but a lot of large companies broadly. I know Home Depot, Microsoft and few other large retail companies some of my network works at hire candidates this way.\n\nIs it fair to the general population? No. But as employees at a company we have limited resources to put into finding quality candidates and we typically use pathways that we know work, and work well in generating high quality hires.\n\nEDIT: Some actionable advice for those who are feeling disheartened. I'll add just a couple of points here:\n\n1. If you already have your MS in this field or a related one and are looking for a job, reach out to your network. Go to the career fairs at your university and see if you can get some data-adjacent job in finance, marketing, operations or sales where you might be working with data scientists. Then you can try to transition internally into the roles that might be interesting to you.\n2. There are also non-profit data organizations like Data Kind and others. They have working data scientists already volunteering time there, you can get involved, get some real world experience with non-profit data sets and leverage that to set yourself apart. It's a fantastic way to get some experience AND build your professional network.\n3. Work on an open-source library and making it better. You'll learn some best practices. If you make it through the online hiring screen, this will really set you apart from other candidates\n4. If you are pre MS and just figuring out where you want to go, research the program's career outcomes before picking a school. No school can guarantee you a job, but many have strong alumni and industry networks that make finding a job way easier. Do not go just because it looks like it's easy to get into. If it's easy to get into, it means that they're a new program who came in with the hype train\n\nEDIT 2: I think some people are getting the wrong idea about \"prestige\" where the companies I'm aware of only hire from Ivies or public universities that are as strong as Ivies. That's not always the case - some schools have deliberately cultivated relationships with employers to generate a talent pipeline for their students. They're not always a top 10 school, but programs with very strong industry connections.\n\nFor example, Penn State is an example of a school with very strong industry ties to companies in NJ, PA and NY for engineering students. These students can go to job fairs or sign up for company interest lists for their degree program at their schools, talk directly to working alumni and recruiters and get their resume in front of a hiring manager that way. It's about the relationship that the university has cultivated to the local industries that hire and their ability to generate candidates that can feed that talent pipeline.", "author_fullname": "t2_j65u2bg31", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Where are all the entry level jobs?

And thus,\u00a0[**Julia**](https://julialang.org/)\u00a0was born (here\u2019s a manifesto explaining\u00a0[**why**](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/)\u00a0in more detail). Its first version was launched a bit more than eleven years ago.\n\n## Our choice\n\nMany in-depth comparisons of Python and Julia on the web (such as\u00a0[**this one**](https://richardpelgrim.medium.com/julia-vs-python-for-data-science-in-2022-1f5f6f38f3ac)\u00a0or\u00a0[**this**](https://www.turing.com/kb/julia-vs-python)) cover both the objective and subjective benefits and drawbacks of choosing one over the other. And given Julia\u2019s growing popularity, we are sure more will follow. In the rest of this blog post, however, let\u2019s explore why we picked Julia for our purposes. And that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t use Python for data science. On the contrary, we\u00a0**often run analyses in both ecosystems simultaneously**\u00a0to help each other out where one is lacking or to reduce the chances of mistakes by comparing their results.\n\n## The advantages of Julia\n\nSo what makes Julia so compelling to us?\n\n## Language features\n\nJulia has:\n\n* a friendly, easy-to-read (and write) syntax;\n* \u00a0a flexible and expressive (part static, part dynamic) type system;\n* \u00a0powerful mathematical notations, such as built-in vector and matrix operations;\n* \u00a0efficient\u00a0[**multiple dispatches**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch), a form of function polymorphism working with runtime types;\n* \u00a0convenient and reliable parallel computing facilities;\n* \u00a0meta-programming with macros and generated functions.\n\n## Fast code execution\n\nJulia compiles the source code to\u00a0**native binary at runtime**\u00a0via LLVM. This approach combines the flexibility of interpreters, such as Python, with the performance of compiled languages, like C++ or Rust. The drawback is that code loading and the first run takes longer;\u00a0**the benefits start to shine when a piece of code is run multiple times**. This unique feature makes it an excellent tool for number crunching but less than ideal for scripting.\n\n## Built-in package management\n\nJulia has a pretty good (albeit not perfect) built-in package management tool, implemented as a base library; and a general registry of open-source packages. The offering of\u00a0**stable and well-designed packages**\u00a0is growing steadily along with the Julia community, especially in data science. Unit testing utilities are also part of the standard library.\n\n## Interactive tools\n\nJulia offers an\u00a0**advanced**\u00a0[**REPL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)\u00a0with all the goodies of an interpreted language environment. These include:\n\n* code and variable inspection,\n* \u00a0code completion,\n* \u00a0an interactive debugger,\n* \u00a0benchmarking and profiling tools,\n* \u00a0and a built-in help system.\n\n**With third-party libraries, it can also be extended**\u00a0with\u00a0[**syntax highlighting**](https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl),\u00a0[**source code lookup**](https://github.com/tkf/InteractiveCodeSearch.jl)\u00a0(even for base libraries), automatic\u00a0[**code reload**](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/), and many more exciting, modern features.\n\nAll these together make Julia an\u00a0**ideal environment for rapid prototyping**.\n\n## From prototyping to production code\n\nBecause of the high-level interactive tools and fast code execution,\u00a0**the transition from a rapid prototype to production-ready code can be as continuous as you\u2019d like**. More often than not, we find that most of the code that implements our business logic in the research code can also be used in the final product.\n\nThanks to its friendly syntax and built-in package management,\u00a0**the road to maintainable code is well paved**. Nothing replaces good API design, coding discipline, and rigorous testing, but Julia helps you to focus on these topics.\n\nAs a consequence, a computation pieced together in the REPL can easily become a piece of prototyping code in a POC module; then later, after some refactoring and unit testing, turn into a chunk of core code in an internal library, and finally, following more cleanup, find itself in a production package.\n\n## The disadvantages of Julia\n\nThat said, every benefit comes at a cost, and Julia is not free from issues. Here are a few stumbling blocks worthy of mentioning:\n\n* the very powerful tool of broadcasting and vectorization can be intimidating at first;\n* [**time to first plot**](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/time-to-first-plot-clarification/58534)\u00a0can be surprising, sometimes inconveniently long, although considerable effort has been put into making it shorter;\n* \u00a0many packages never reach a stable state or just become unmaintained; others are poorly designed or written;\n* [**releasing a binary package**](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl)\u00a0can be challenging, and compilation time can be unexpectedly long, not to mention obfuscation, which can also be tricky.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn conclusion, the choice between programming languages for data analysis is not always clear-cut. While Python has been the go-to language for many data scientists, Julia is rapidly gaining popularity for its unique set of features that make it an attractive option. In this blog post, we explored why we chose Julia over Python for our purposes, highlighting its language features, fast code execution, built-in package management, interactive tools, and ease of transitioning from prototyping to production code. However, we also acknowledged that Julia has challenges, including overcoming some learning curves and the occasional instability of packages. Ultimately, the choice between Julia and Python (or any other programming language) will depend on specific project requirements, personal preferences, and available resources.\n\nStill, in the past years,\u00a0**Julia has proved to be our reliable and faithful companion**. It has evolved, matured, and improved significantly, and we would be less happy and less successful without it.

This approach combines the flexibility of interpreters, such as Python, with the performance of compiled languages, like C++ or Rust. The drawback is that code loading and the first run takes longer;\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;the benefits start to shine when a piece of code is run multiple times&lt;/strong&gt;. This unique feature makes it an excellent tool for number crunching but less than ideal for scripting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Built-in package management&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julia has a pretty good (albeit not perfect) built-in package management tool, implemented as a base library; and a general registry of open-source packages. The offering of\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;stable and well-designed packages&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0is growing steadily along with the Julia community, especially in data science. Unit testing utilities are also part of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Interactive tools&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julia offers an\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;advanced&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with all the goodies of an interpreted language environment. These include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;code and variable inspection,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0code completion,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0an interactive debugger,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0benchmarking and profiling tools,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0and a built-in help system.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With third-party libraries, it can also be extended&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/tkf/InteractiveCodeSearch.jl\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;source code lookup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(even for base libraries), automatic\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;code reload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and many more exciting, modern features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All these together make Julia an\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;ideal environment for rapid prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;From prototyping to production code&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the high-level interactive tools and fast code execution,\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;the transition from a rapid prototype to production-ready code can be as continuous as you\u2019d like&lt;/strong&gt;. More often than not, we find that most of the code that implements our business logic in the research code can also be used in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its friendly syntax and built-in package management,\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;the road to maintainable code is well paved&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing replaces good API design, coding discipline, and rigorous testing, but Julia helps you to focus on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, a computation pieced together in the REPL can easily become a piece of prototyping code in a POC module; then later, after some refactoring and unit testing, turn into a chunk of core code in an internal library, and finally, following more cleanup, find itself in a production package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The disadvantages of Julia&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, every benefit comes at a cost, and Julia is not free from issues. Here are a few stumbling blocks worthy of mentioning:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the very powerful tool of broadcasting and vectorization can be intimidating at first;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/time-to-first-plot-clarification/58534\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;time to first plot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be surprising, sometimes inconveniently long, although considerable effort has been put into making it shorter;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0many packages never reach a stable state or just become unmaintained; others are poorly designed or written;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;releasing a binary package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be challenging, and compilation time can be unexpectedly long, not to mention obfuscation, which can also be tricky.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the choice between programming languages for data analysis is not always clear-cut. While Python has been the go-to language for many data scientists, Julia is rapidly gaining popularity for its unique set of features that make it an attractive option. In this blog post, we explored why we chose Julia over Python for our purposes, highlighting its language features, fast code execution, built-in package management, interactive tools, and ease of transitioning from prototyping to production code. However, we also acknowledged that Julia has challenges, including overcoming some learning curves and the occasional instability of packages. Ultimately, the choice between Julia and Python (or any other programming language) will depend on specific project requirements, personal preferences, and available resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, in the past years,\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;Julia has proved to be our reliable and faithful companion&lt;/strong&gt;. It has evolved, matured, and improved significantly, and we would be less happy and less successful without it. So cheers, Julia; we are excited to see what your future brings!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,

in college studying economics &amp; data science at USC and have been lucky enough to have space in my schedule so that I\u2019ll also be graduating with an MS in Applied Data Science. So far I\u2019m a bit fearful with regards to my level of preparation for the workforce and I\u2019m not entirely sold on the quality of the data science degree programs and classes. All of this is to say that I have to choose one of the following courses as an undergraduate elective next year and would appreciate any advisement:\n\nCalc 3 \u2014 Feels like a course that\u2019s pretty essential to understanding higher level statistics and a lot of the things happening behind the scenes in models. Medium degree of difficulty at my university.\n\nAdvanced Econometrics \u2014 Definitely the hardest course of the bunch. Seems like having a more in-depth knowledge of time series is pretty useful, though.\n\nData Visualization \u2014 I really don\u2019t have much experience in this domain.
