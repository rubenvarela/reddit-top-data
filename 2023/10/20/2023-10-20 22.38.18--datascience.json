Hired me, and instead letting me get oriented into my role, decided to do what she called \"trial by fire\", just throw me into the deep and and see if I sink or swim.

Completely incompetent, never actually did any of the subject that they were managing a team for. Ended up being fired for sexual harassment against many women on our team \n\n\n\n5. Came from another team to replace previous manager, gave me mountains of work and impossible goals and expectations to achieve, and even when achieving them, made up a bunch of excuses as to why I can't be promoted that made no sense.

For the first year, great to work under them, they let me get situated in the role, let me get exposure to many different teams and departments, let me explore and provided coaching. However, after the first year, became very lazy as a manager. Never at their desk, always driving somewhere, scheduling meetings and then being 15 plus minutes late to them because again, they are driving somewhere, or not doing their job.

However, the problem is that almost every data distribution involving human interactions will tend to shift over time and contain some dependency.\n\nLet me give you one example: Let's say we have a web app that lets users submit a picture of an animal and we predict whether it's a dog or not. This seems like a simple problem where you could split by iid because there can't be any data leakage, right?\n\nBut if you think about it, the distribution of photos that get submitted is likely to change over time. It could be from new dog breeds becoming more popular, or from a shift in the types of users that use the platform and the dogs they submit. It could even be due to new phones/cameras being used, or people start posing their photos slightly differently or maybe covid hits and now your service is only getting indoor photos with different lighting whereas previously you got mostly outdoor shots.\n\nThese are all hypothetical examples and you could come up with a million different ones. The point being that the distribution of data for many many (most?) problems will change over time and our goal is almost always to train on historical data and predict on future unseen data.\n\nSo with that context, I think it often makes sense to at least test a time-split approach and observe whether there's a difference with simple iid CV approach.

However, the problem is that almost every data distribution involving human interactions will tend to shift over time and contain some dependency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me give you one example: Let&amp;#39;s say we have a web app that lets users submit a picture of an animal and we predict whether it&amp;#39;s a dog or not. This seems like a simple problem where you could split by iid because there can&amp;#39;t be any data leakage, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you think about it, the distribution of photos that get submitted is likely to change over time. It could be from new dog breeds becoming more popular, or from a shift in the types of users that use the platform and the dogs they submit. It could even be due to new phones/cameras being used, or people start posing their photos slightly differently or maybe covid hits and now your service is only getting indoor photos with different lighting whereas previously you got mostly outdoor shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all hypothetical examples and you could come up with a million different ones.

So I interviewed and got an offer with PwC for their AI Innovation Labs as a DS. The pay is better too. When I told my ACN manager I was planning to leave, he is trying to get me to stay by saying that we will be getting involved with the a Data Science team at the FAANG as our client and that I would be involved it in as a DE working alongside a DS. He said if I really want to leave, I should leave for a product company/leave and work for the FAANG client team once I have more experience on their DS team.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am wondering -- If my career goal is to be a Data Scientist at a large tech/product company, should I leave Accenture and be a Data Scientist at PWC to gain more experience for a few years, then leave for product company, or should I take the risk of staying at Accenture and hope I get exposure to the FAANG Client data science team and can eventually get a job with the client team in data science?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17cji27", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ok_Sprinkles8216", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17cji27/stay_at_current_job_or_take_data_science_role_at/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17cji27/stay_at_current_job_or_take_data_science_role_at/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1092670, "created_utc": 1697830620.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I'm building a product that integrates with your codebases and takes your database metadata to create dynamic documentation of your data.
