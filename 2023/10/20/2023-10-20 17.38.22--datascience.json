Most positions at analyst level are designed so that no one can proceed into other positions because they want you to stay exactly where you are currently and not move up, they try to make it as difficult as possible for you to move up into other roles in the company.

Completely worthless leader who came aboard to replace another director, and their first mission was to interrogate everyone on the team, and determine if their career goals were to stay in their current position. Anyone who desired career growth, or wanted to move up into management, or had career aspirations was immediately let go because they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;Not a fit for our organizational goals&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most common thing I have seen is that it is impossible to get promoted. Most positions at analyst level are designed so that no one can proceed into other positions because they want you to stay exactly where you are currently and not move up, they try to make it as difficult as possible for you to move up into other roles in the company. If you don&amp;#39;t want to sit exactly where you are for at least 5 to 10 years, you&amp;#39;re a bad employee, and there is no way to be promoted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17cfb97", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "InevitableTraining69", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17cfb97/i_have_never_had_a_manager_in_my_entire_career/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17cfb97/i_have_never_had_a_manager_in_my_entire_career/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1092396, "created_utc": 1697819256.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_53lxlqwu", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What's one file or other digital resource which if deleted would most affect the world?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "fun", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_17ccv2x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Fun/Trivia", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1697812844.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b026063c-d780-11e7-aba9-0e030591a4b4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "17ccv2x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SHJPEM", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/17ccv2x/whats_one_file_or_other_digital_resource_which_if/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17ccv2x/whats_one_file_or_other_digital_resource_which_if/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1092396, "created_utc": 1697812844.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "In my about 5 years of experience working for a medium sized organization, I have seen a lot of value in building and maintaining CRUD or CRUD like apps that allows business users input, interact, and distribute data and models.
