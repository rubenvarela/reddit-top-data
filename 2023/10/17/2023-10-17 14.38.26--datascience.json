You then need to build a full pipeline that pulls the data from 10 different data sources that don't link to each other naturally, do regression tests because they don't update consistently, transform it, do feature engineering, feed it to a model, monitor the model for drift, redo everything after you find out a feature is completely different from what you were told, and the list goes on.

The answer lies in the fascinating world of human motion analysis!\n\nIn this discussion, we delve into the concept of \"features\" in the context of human motion. Features are scalar values obtained from motion segments, offering insights into movement patterns. We explore how these features are essential in addressing diverse challenges and share insights into the basic features of movements.\n\n# \ud83d\udca1 What's a Feature?  \n\nIn this context, a feature refers to a scalar value obtained from a motion segment. For example, the average acceleration of a cursor. As depicted in the diagram below, users cannot be distinguished solely based on their average acceleration, but there are discernible individual tendencies.\n\n The next step involves constructing our feature space by identifying features that contain relevant information about movement patterns. \n\n# \ud83d\udcca Analyzing the appropriate time series\n\nThe majority of the data we work with consists of x and y coordinates that change over time, such as the position of a cursor or a pen on a screen. Therefore, we already have two time series. Additionally, we calculate directional speeds, accelerations, jerks, as well as direction-independent speed, acceleration, and jerk. \n\n**Unmasking forgery through speed analysis**\n\nLet\u2019s explain the use of derivatives through an example of **signature forgery**. Suppose someone attempts to replicate a signature they have seen before, familiar with its form. How would you approach this situation? Initially, one might **meticulously trace the line to be replicated, proceeding slowly and accurately**, inch by inch. The result would be a slow, nearly constant-speed movement. **The speed time series would exhibit an approximately constant value.**\n\nNow, imagine **someone writing their own signature**. **The speed can vary significantly**, but it won\u2019t remain constant. They would draw longer, straight lines more quickly and slow down at tight turns. When moving right and upwards, the arcs would be faster and more dynamic than when turning left. Even if the forged signature\u2019s image is an exact copy of the genuine one in terms of x-y coordinates, **the speed profiles would look entirely different.**\n\nOf course, this was a rather clumsy attempt at forgery; there are far more skilled individuals in this field. The speed of a signature can be estimated based on the signature image alone, either by assuming faster movement on straight lines and slower movement on curves or by considering the line quality.\n\nDelving into the details is beyond the scope of this discussion, but the key point is that estimating and replicating the speed of motion requires practice and talent. It is more challenging than simply replicating the x-y coordinates of the signature image. Moreover, forging the acceleration and other factors becomes even more difficult.\n\nIn theory, we could **take derivatives of our time series as many times as desired**. However, there is a practical limit as, **after a certain point, the derivative becomes more noise than meaningful information.**\n\nFrom this example, it becomes apparent why we thought utilizing derivatives (speed, acceleration, jerk) was a valuable approach for motion analysis. **When we began using this method, the results demonstrated exceptional accuracy**.\n\n# \ud83d\udd0d Describing Time Series with Scalar Values \n\n We have extracted various time series from our motion sample. To condense the valuable information of a lengthy time series into scalar values, **we employ a straightforward approach: calculating a few statistical characteristics**. Our selection criteria ensure that these characteristics effectively represent the distribution of the time series.\n\nSome of these characteristics are expected, such as the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation.\n\nTo understand how the values progress from the minimum to the maximum, we utilize percentiles, including the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles. The minimum and maximum values are also considered as percentiles, specifically the 0th and 100th percentiles.\n\nTwo lesser-known statistical values are skewness and kurtosis. **Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution**. For instance, if the speed values below and above the average speed are evenly spaced, the skewness will be around zero. However, if there are numerous values below the mean but close to it, with only a few exceptionally high values above, the skewness will be positive.\n\nIn the context of cursor movement, this suggests that an individual typically uses the cursor at a relatively constant speed, but occasionally makes sudden moves. This could be a personal habit or characteristic.\n\nOn the other hand, **kurtosis indicates whether the values are concentrated around the mean or spread out across a broader range**.\n\nThese are the basic features we utilize for analysis.\n\nFeel free to join the discussion and share your thoughts on this fascinating intersection of technology and human motion analysis! \ud83d\udcac\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udcbb", "author_fullname": "t2_gbypvyyx9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cracking the Code of Human Motion: Describing Movement Patterns with Scalar Values", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/datascience", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_179u12d", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1697533471.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.datascience", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey fellow Redditors!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how technology can tackle a range of challenges like signature authentication, detecting cheaters in games, assessing neurological conditions, or dealing with pesky bots?
