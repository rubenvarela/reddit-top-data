I am unsure if taking this offer is the right move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy current role: Data scientist at a small (\\~10 ppl) asset management firm. They are setting up a new quant trading (stat arb) strategy and hired me as part of a new team. I took this offer because I am interested in a quant researcher role but couldn't get in one of those big quant trading firms, so I am trying to use this position as a stepping stone to better places. The problems are:\n\n* The actual job is nothing like what I was told during interview. 75% of the job are ad-hoc admin tasks, like preparing monthly fund performance reports, booking trades done by their manual trader (for their other non-quant funds), fixing the trader's Excel formulas, and helping non-tech staff run some Python scripts. I am even officially in their \"operation\" team now. This frankly is not what I expected.\n* This firm has a weak tech foundation. They are just starting to do quant trading, so I understand that they don't have any existing infrastructure. What worries me more however is that they have no experienced developer neither; the only developer here has less than 1 YoE. I am afraid the project will quickly become a hell of technical debt.\n* This firm is not very quantitative neither. The only real quant here has a straightly business background and received no formal math training beyond first year calculus (and no PhD ofc). He does have solid &gt;5 year YoE as a quant trader, which is what really matters.\n* The quant work I got to do is alright. The strategy they are developing sounds promising to me as a layman. If nothing else, at least I learned something about finance. I am unsure how this experience in a small fund will be valued when I enter the job market again.\n* Overall, I think it all comes down to me not feeling enough growth opportunity. Quant research is one exciting opportunity that aligns with my technical interest, but I don't want to overly confine myself in that narrow space -- the quant industry is so competitive that I don't even know if I can get a next job. If I cannot stay in quant, the other option for me is a data scientist role in other sectors. But then, I am now spending 75% of my day doing work that adds zero transferable data skill to my profile.\n* I am however aware that my worldview has become too academic after spending the extra years in school for my Master, so maybe all this is normal in the workspace and I am just being unrealistic.\n\nThe other role: Data scientist at a large tech company (\\~3000 employees).\n\n* The team lead there promised a salary higher than my current role (which is alright but not yet &gt;100k), although I think it will be at best a 10% raise. If I take into account of bonus, probably I will get paid more overall if I can stay where I am for a full year.\n* From what I heard, this company is building a new team to make use of the TB's of service usage data they have collected, mainly for marketing optimization. This team is more mature, with a functional tech stack and experienced data scientists and engineers. The team lead said this will be an opportunity for me to gain experience in being a \"full stack\" data scientist.\n* I have a friend currently working in this company, and he said the job is just like what was on paper; I won't be wasting 75% of my time doing admin work like where I am.\n* My main concern here is essentially the opposite of if I stay in my current role: I am afraid that taking this offer would mean the door to quant research is completely closed for me. Honestly, I think as a data scientist, going for quant related roles is the fastest way to reach my financial goals.

But that is not the point.. the point is I wanna know how do I make sure me and team learn to analyse, solve and measure analytical problems and ther outcomes.\nI thought going through few case studies, of other organisations, which covers issues of analytics/ data science team and how they solved them would give a good picture of how analytics problem solving should go .\nI looked up online to find such stories but couldn't come with anything really usefull.\nI would like to get few resources that's i can share with my team, or have a understanding of how do I go on about starting to solve our organisation's small analytics tasks.\nEngineering part is not a issue for us. We have a great and very supportive engineering team.
