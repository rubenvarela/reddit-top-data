There are a few reasons for this:\n\n* I don't have a team. It was pretty fun at first to come in and take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit and answer people's data questions that they'd been stuck with for a long time. But I don't feel like I'm learning anything new anymore, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out how I can make myself progress. My manager is great but does not have a background in data science, and I don't have peers I can discuss my work with.\n* Our leadership doesn't really understand data analysis. The CEO is always asking for \"insights\" as if I can just comb through our database and magically come up with recommendations for how to improve the business. In short, because I'm the only person doing any sort of analysis, and our engineering team is pretty lean and doesn't particularly focus on data collection/integrity/etc., it can be hard to even get an analysis started (and I always have to push really hard to e.g. get engineering to set up the data tracking I need). When I have presented data analyses that I've done, I've noticed that the CEO only cares about findings that affirm what he already believes, which is really annoying because at that point, why should I even put in any effort?\n* I have to do a lot of stuff that isn't really relevant to my role because I'm the only one who can do it. For example, our finance team relies on me for a lot of important reporting (e.g. when we are talking to investors), and I end up being the person who has to put together long financial reports (which isn't so bad) and audit/reconcile different metrics when they don't look right or don't match between sources (which is really quite terribly boring). To be fair, my job description does include making dashboards and reports, but it's gotten to the point where my day-to-day is often answering questions like \"why doesn't this number \\[pulled from our prod database\\] not match this other number \\[displayed on some dashboard I know nothing about that was made by some random engineer\\]\" or \"do we track \\[x metric\\] somewhere and where can I find it\" (the answer is no, we don't, so I need to go meet with engineering to set it up).\n* Finally, our leadership has constantly pivoted business models during the time I've been here. I get that we're in tough times and startups need to be flexible, but at this point, the product is pretty different from what it was when I came in, and I'm not that excited about it anymore. So there isn't even motivation from believing in the product anymore.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and feel like I should probably quit my job and find a new one where I am a bit better supported and can have some more mentorship. This is only my second job out of college, and while I've learned a lot from being the only person in this role, I think I want to be in an environment where I can get some more direct guidance - often, I'm not sure if what I'm doing is anywhere near what's considered \"best practice\". But I'd feel bad about just completely ditching the company. My coworkers are so nice, and I'm the only person who knows both our database and our BI platform well enough to generate reports/dashboards efficiently, so I think it would be very bad if I just quit one day, even with a two-week notice.\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this situation?

Even the subfield of physics matches. \n\nReading through the job offer I got pretty confident that I was a really good match, fitting almost everything they needed plus some more of my own strengths, etc. So obviously I applied. There's the usual upload your resume, basic information, etc.\n\nThen the website brings me to a new page where they ask a few basic questions which I answer truthfully and in a positive way. Until I reach: \"Do you have any experience with Federated Learning?\"  The real answer is No, I don't. And that's what I clicked, being honest and all. But I realise that clicking No means _being automatically rejected / filtered away without a chance of defending myself!_ In front of a human recruiter, I would say no but that the concept does not sound so daunting and that I have proven track at fast adaptation and learning, which means I'm likely to very quickly pick it up. But there is no human recruiter in front of me. And in that way, I cannot emphasise on all the technical and non-technical aspects that would be my strengths for that job. Which leads to: a mediocre candidate with some experience at that specific skill has a higher chance that an almost perfect match which is only lacking in that area. \n\nMeaning: I'm getting rejected from a dream job without a chance to even defend that I'm a very good match.\n\nSo of course, I'm thinking of simply lying the next time.

This saves me a great amount of time and I would like to share this improvement with other users. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, myself and the user group is not working in the data science realm and would find my solution difficult to work with. (Understandable) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to make my automated approach more user friendly? How can I share this with my user group without necessarily directly providing them the code? Is this possible, or do they need to learn? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Appreciate your insight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "10w9aak", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jazzlike_Sound4257", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/10w9aak/selling_and_implementing_data_science_solutions/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10w9aak/selling_and_implementing_data_science_solutions/", "subreddit_subscribers": 845746, "created_utc": 1675794823.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
