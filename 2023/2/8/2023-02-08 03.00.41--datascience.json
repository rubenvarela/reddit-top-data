I'm in my second year in the role, and although I enjoyed my first year very much, I've noticed that I've really been not having a good time lately. There are a few reasons for this:\n\n* I don't have a team. It was pretty fun at first to come in and take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit and answer people's data questions that they'd been stuck with for a long time. But I don't feel like I'm learning anything new anymore, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out how I can make myself progress. My manager is great but does not have a background in data science, and I don't have peers I can discuss my work with.\n* Our leadership doesn't really understand data analysis. The CEO is always asking for \"insights\" as if I can just comb through our database and magically come up with recommendations for how to improve the business. In short, because I'm the only person doing any sort of analysis, and our engineering team is pretty lean and doesn't particularly focus on data collection/integrity/etc., it can be hard to even get an analysis started (and I always have to push really hard to e.g. get engineering to set up the data tracking I need). When I have presented data analyses that I've done, I've noticed that the CEO only cares about findings that affirm what he already believes, which is really annoying because at that point, why should I even put in any effort?\n* I have to do a lot of stuff that isn't really relevant to my role because I'm the only one who can do it. For example, our finance team relies on me for a lot of important reporting (e.g. when we are talking to investors), and I end up being the person who has to put together long financial reports (which isn't so bad) and audit/reconcile different metrics when they don't look right or don't match between sources (which is really quite terribly boring). To be fair, my job description does include making dashboards and reports, but it's gotten to the point where my day-to-day is often answering questions like \"why doesn't this number \\[pulled from our prod database\\] not match this other number \\[displayed on some dashboard I know nothing about that was made by some random engineer\\]\" or \"do we track \\[x metric\\] somewhere and where can I find it\" (the answer is no, we don't, so I need to go meet with engineering to set it up).\n* Finally, our leadership has constantly pivoted business models during the time I've been here. I get that we're in tough times and startups need to be flexible, but at this point, the product is pretty different from what it was when I came in, and I'm not that excited about it anymore. So there isn't even motivation from believing in the product anymore.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and feel like I should probably quit my job and find a new one where I am a bit better supported and can have some more mentorship. This is only my second job out of college, and while I've learned a lot from being the only person in this role, I think I want to be in an environment where I can get some more direct guidance - often, I'm not sure if what I'm doing is anywhere near what's considered \"best practice\". But I'd feel bad about just completely ditching the company. My coworkers are so nice, and I'm the only person who knows both our database and our BI platform well enough to generate reports/dashboards efficiently, so I think it would be very bad if I just quit one day, even with a two-week notice.\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this situation?
