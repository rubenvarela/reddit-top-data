I am looking to have a discussion with you guys about designing data-marts for business reporting where the data for the marts are extracted and transformed from a centralized Data Lake.\n\nWe have an Extract and Load process from our sources into an Azure Data Lake. Data in the lake is currently only used in ML or data-driven applications, not really for traditional BI uses. However, as we are advancing our platform to increase our value to the business, we are needing to enable these types of traditional BI reporting capabilities on top of the data we ingest into our data lake. Everything we develop is project-specific and must be approved by a portfolio board. So, the plan is to develop project-based data-marts in an Azure dedicated SQL pool (Azure Data warehouse).\n\n[Extract and Load into the Data Store\\/Central Repository. Parquets stored in Azure Data Lake Storage](https://preview.redd.it/muy6ytyxhkka1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8d835743a515c4c89058bf970c5eaa403770350a)\n\n&gt;*I will preface that I am in an awkward position, because I come from BI and analytics, not architecture or engineering. Nonetheless, I transitioned into an IT role last year, where we do not have a senior data engineer, or any dedicated engineer at all that can help with this advancement. I am looking to fill that piece of the team, but am basically a junior DE with no senior DE to learn from... I have been running the POC's and want to make sure the way I plan the data-marts at least make sense. I know I won't create the perfect solution the first-time around, but I want to at least start in the right direction. I don't love having to go to reddit to have these discussions, but it is really my only option at this point...*\n\nThe Data Lake will serve as the central repository/data store for all downstream use-cases. The transformation process will be Dockerized python-based data pipelines running on a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline will extract data from the lake, perform the data transformations needed for the business use-case (business rules, joins, conditions, filters, etc...), and load the transformed data into a data-mart in the warehouse.\n\n**I am just really confused as to how these data-marts should be modeled in the warehouse. Some options I can think of are:**\n\n1. The transformation results in a denormalized OBT structure that is stored in a specific schema. In this option, 1 database schema = 1 data mart, and the data mart is just a single OBT. New data are loaded into the lake, transformed with python (Docker + Kubernetes), and records are then inserted into the OBT/mart in the warehouse. Although this makes sense to me, I feel like it isn't best, as every mart would just a single table in a specific database schema. If the business needs lots of potential dimensions at their immediate disposal in the semantic model, this method doesn't seem to be practical.\n\n[1 data warehouse schema = 1 data mart, where each mart is just a denormalized OBT](https://preview.redd.it/v8wkifdnhkka1.jpg?width=1362&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bbcbb646a00bd8a24e4787f550fa320049576907)\n\n2. The transformation results in a star-schema structure that is stored in a specific database schema. With this option, 1 data mart = 1 database schema, and the table schema resembles a star-schema. The issue with this is I think I would just be duplicating dimensions in different database schemas. Maybe this is okay? If I create a mart to track delivery performance for logistics, I would need to source the customers table from the lake. If later I create another mart to track sales, I would also need to source the customer table from the lake. Now I have two customer tables in different schemas of the warehouse. This honestly might not be a big deal since the dimensions are sourced from the sample data in the data lake.\n\n[1 data warehouse schema = 1 data mart, where each mart is a single fact table with multiple dimensions](https://preview.redd.it/bgusekfphkka1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=abd7ac824d2ba3844ac27856b17bc8ab835fafcb)\n\n3. A combination of 1 and 2. I can imagine some marts are better off as a OBT structure, while others would benefit from a star schema. Could also create a constellation structure if multiple facts are required.\n\n4. I am way off all together, and I am not thinking about this correctly (which honestly may be the case and explains why I am so confused). Like what if I need to have a combination of non-aggregated fact tables alongside aggregated tables for easier analysis? Would I just throw all of these inside the same data warehouse schema?", "author_fullname": "t2_9uqlze0a", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title":

I am looking to have a discussion with you guys about designing data-marts for business reporting where the data for the marts are extracted and transformed from a centralized Data Lake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have an Extract and Load process from our sources into an Azure Data Lake. Data in the lake is currently only used in ML or data-driven applications, not really for traditional BI uses. However, as we are advancing our platform to increase our value to the business, we are needing to enable these types of traditional BI reporting capabilities on top of the data we ingest into our data lake. Everything we develop is project-specific and must be approved by a portfolio board. So, the plan is to develop project-based data-marts in an Azure dedicated SQL pool (Azure Data warehouse).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/muy6ytyxhkka1.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=8d835743a515c4c89058bf970c5eaa403770350a\"&gt;Extract and Load into the Data Store/Central Repository. Parquets stored in Azure Data Lake Storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will preface that I am in an awkward position, because I come from BI and analytics, not architecture or engineering. Nonetheless, I transitioned into an IT role last year, where we do not have a senior data engineer, or any dedicated engineer at all that can help with this advancement. I am looking to fill that piece of the team, but am basically a junior DE with no senior DE to learn from... I have been running the POC&amp;#39;s and want to make sure the way I plan the data-marts at least make sense. I know I won&amp;#39;t create the perfect solution the first-time around, but I want to at least start in the right direction. I don&amp;#39;t love having to go to reddit to have these discussions, but it is really my only option at this point...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Data Lake will serve as the central repository/data store for all downstream use-cases. The transformation process will be Dockerized python-based data pipelines running on a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline will extract data from the lake, perform the data transformations needed for the business use-case (business rules, joins, conditions, filters, etc...), and load the transformed data into a data-mart in the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am just really confused as to how these data-marts should be modeled in the warehouse. Some options I can think of are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The transformation results in a denormalized OBT structure that is stored in a specific schema. In this option, 1 database schema = 1 data mart, and the data mart is just a single OBT. New data are loaded into the lake, transformed with python (Docker + Kubernetes), and records are then inserted into the OBT/mart in the warehouse. Although this makes sense to me, I feel like it isn&amp;#39;t best, as every mart would just a single table in a specific database schema. If the business needs lots of potential dimensions at their immediate disposal in the semantic model, this method doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be practical.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v8wkifdnhkka1.jpg?width=1362&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=bbcbb646a00bd8a24e4787f550fa320049576907\"&gt;1 data warehouse schema = 1 data mart, where each mart is just a denormalized OBT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The transformation results in a star-schema structure that is stored in a specific database schema. With this option, 1 data mart = 1 database schema, and the table schema resembles a star-schema. The issue with this is I think I would just be duplicating dimensions in different database schemas. Maybe this is okay? If I create a mart to track delivery performance for logistics, I would need to source the customers table from the lake. If later I create another mart to track sales, I would also need to source the customer table from the lake. Now I have two customer tables in different schemas of the warehouse. This honestly might not be a big deal since the dimensions are sourced from the sample data in the data lake.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bgusekfphkka1.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=abd7ac824d2ba3844ac27856b17bc8ab835fafcb\"&gt;1 data warehouse schema = 1 data mart, where each mart is a single fact table with multiple dimensions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of 1 and 2. I can imagine some marts are better off as a OBT structure, while others would benefit from a star schema. Could also create a constellation structure if multiple facts are required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am way off all together, and I am not thinking about this correctly (which honestly may be the case and explains why I am so confused). Like what if I need to have a combination of non-aggregated fact tables alongside aggregated tables for easier analysis? Would I just throw all of these inside the same data warehouse schema?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "92b74b58-aaca-11eb-b160-0e6181e3773f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_36en4", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "id": "11cneq2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EarthEmbarrassed4301", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/11cneq2/structuring_data_marts_from_a_data_lake/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/11cneq2/structuring_data_marts_from_a_data_lake/", "subreddit_subscribers": 91270, "created_utc": 1677433180.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "dataengineering", "selftext": "For example, go on Indeed, and look at data engineering jobs posted recently in big tech cities like San Francisco.
