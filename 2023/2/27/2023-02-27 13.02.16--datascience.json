I got my masters in statistics and wanted to get into the data analyst field since my bachelors so I was really excited when I got my job. Since the last year my boss has been shooting down basically most of my ideas. They gave me complex survey design data to work with and at first I suggested doing some models but I was told that was too advance for public health stakeholders and just should stick to descriptive statistics. Well when we presented to stake holders they ended up asking for more advanced statistics so after that I was allowed to do a manuscript. As I was writing it, I went based of their goals from their survey. I wasn\u2019t part of the development of the survey and was just responsible for finding something interesting based on their goals. But when my boss saw it she just asked me why I did it that way, then I explained to her my rationale for using a logistic regression but then she started questioning why I even chose those questions as part of the goals which i responded as those were the questions defined in their documentation(she was part of the survey development) as part of the goals.  She said I still hadn\u2019t explained why I did it so she  asked me if I had a comprehensive report of all the survey questions which I  didn\u2019t. Because my first task had been to do descriptive statistics.  But now I was now being tasked to do some modeling not to do a bunch of cross tabulations.  I had already written over 40 pages of a manuscript and she basically asked me to start over and so then I asked for clarification if they wanted to do every possible combination of 50 questions or a summary of what I found interesting? I thought I was going base off their goals and wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted from me. Which then I was told to do a comprehensive report of demographics against the 50 survey questions. So I did it in a dashboard and which was the first time this department had even used a dashboard. I was pretty happy and excited to learn how to do a dashboard.  When I presented it to her she praised it but then started having so many edits and changes. I didn\u2019t feel like she was satisfied with my work. Some of her feedback was that she didn\u2019t like that I had used the questions as titles and wanted them now as statements, and she said it was personal preference but yet she continued going through a list of these things I need to change in the graphs. This has been going for 5 months and I can\u2019t move forward with anything in this project . Everytime I try to do what she wants and present it to her she asks me if I have done something else and now I have to do that something else and it just keeps on repeating. I\u2019ve asked her to give me a template of what she wants but she doesn\u2019t have an answer. She just tells me to ask myself what is this telling people. In the comprehensive report/dashboard she asked me to remove questions because she said \u201cyou have to ask yourself, does this question have any meaning?\u201d I was told to do a comprehensive report so I didn\u2019t remove any questions and I didn\u2019t write the questions myself she and the team wrote the questions so I\u2019m confused why they wrote questions they don\u2019t think are meaningful to begin with? I guess the team has noticed I\u2019ve been \u201carguing\u201d with her but all I think I\u2019ve done is ask for clarification so I can have some progress and be able to satisfy their needs. Ever since then she\u2019s been asking me to email her everyday what I\u2019m going to do and when I\u2019m clocking in and when I\u2019m clocking out. This started about 4 months ago. Even on her days off/ vacation she\u2019ll ask me to send her an email CCing her and my other supervisor. I understand CCing my present supervisor but I\u2019m not sure why her as well since she\u2019s on her days off. I\u2019m looking for another job rn and feel so disillusioned in this job.

I started wondering if maybe I\u2019m an idiot and couldn\u2019t understand what they wanted or if they were not being clear.

She doesn\u2019t like working with our boss because she constantly interrupts and has also shot down all of her potential publications. My only fear with this is that I know I only have a little over a year of experience and I\u2019m missing something and go to another job not learning how I can be a better data analyst.

My initial thought was to store the data in a database, and pull budgets into Excel using SQL, allow users to input changes to project specifications, then push back to the SQL server, and do transformations based on users updated specs there.  I have little to no knowledge about SQL.  I am confident I could learn it well enough to implement a solution if this is the best use for this case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that someone with a greater data science understanding than I do can point me in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "937a6f50-d780-11e7-826d-0ed1beddcc82", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "11czf1z", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TouchToLose", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/11czf1z/looking_for_direction/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11czf1z/looking_for_direction/", "subreddit_subscribers": 852278, "created_utc": 1677462434.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I saw post in this sub earlier someone asked what is the difference between Data Analyst and Data Scientist.
