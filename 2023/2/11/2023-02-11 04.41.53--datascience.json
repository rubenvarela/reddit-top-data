My major is in Economics and I made the decision to transition into this field pretty late (in my junior year), so I spent the holidays studying math and stats when everyone else was chasing internships (most of them failed due to covid19 though, so I guess I made a good choice).\n\nI didn't have high expectations when I applied to masters programs in both countries (since my major wasn't that quantitative imo), but surprisingly I was given an offer by two universities - one for each country. For the UK, I was contacted by the University of Oxford to study MSc (Master of Science) Social Data Science, and for the US I was given an offer by Harvard university to study MS Data Science in their engineering department. Now I need to choose one between the two programs.\n\nI did a lot of research, and currently here are what I believe to be the pros and cons of each program based on its curriculum and location:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOxford\n\n[OII | MSc in Social Data Science (ox.ac.uk)](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/)\n\nOxford's program is not as rigorous as standard MS Data Science programs (see the 'Social' part) because their curriculum focuses on applying data science in social science contexts, and the program lasts for 1 year. But it provides a lot of training on how to extract insight from data with a social science lens and I believe this will be useful if I wish to become a data analyst.\n\nThe best thing about Oxford is that it is based in the UK, where you can apply for a 2-year graduate visa after graduation. This visa allows students to stay in the UK for 2 years to get some experience (such as internships and jobs) without needing to be sponsored. This option is very attractive for me because I literally have zero industry experience (no internships) due to having spent my time studying quantitative stuff in the later years of my undergraduate. Therefore, if I choose Oxford, I will apply for this visa and try to get some data analyst internships in the UK after graduation. In addition, Oxford's tuition is much cheaper than Harvard's (expected total cost is approximately $63K)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHarvard\n\n[Master's in Data Science | Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-data-science)\n\nHarvard's program is pretty rigorous. It is part of the engineering department and lasts for 1.5 years. The curriculum is certainly more appealing than that of Oxford because I believe I can definitely learn all the quantitative things needed to become an entry-leve data scientist. However, there are some serious problems.\n\nFirst, Harvard' program is extremely expensive. It is approximately twice more expensive than the total cost of attending Oxford. Very sad that there aren't funding opportunities, but I guess that's to be expected from masters programs in the US. Although my parents will be funding my studies (eternally grateful to them and I know many around the world aren't able to receive funding from their parents) it doesn't change the fact that it's a lot of financial burden.\n\nSecond, it will be almost impossible for me to get industry experience. I know that many international people use masters programs to get a job in the US and stay there, but for an international student who has no prior work experience and no undergraduate STEM degree, I know that for such a competitive field it will be very difficult to even acquire an internship in the US, much less a full time job. And visa rules in the US require you to get a job in 3 months after graduating in a related field (for me it would be data science/analytics) or else you need to go back to your home country. Therefore, it is very likely that I will be returning to my home country with just the masters degree and no internship. I don't know if this will help me get a job even back in my country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome things to note:\n\nI am not desperate to stay in a particular country to work there - I am perfectly fine with going back to my own country after graduation. However, I really wish to get some work experience (internships) before going back, so that I can maximize my chances of getting a lucrative job in my country. Also, I am aware that entry level data scientist positions are almost non-existent these days and everybody seems to start out as a data analyst. I'm fine with this, because in my country a masters degree in a quantitative subject is required to become even a data analyst, much less a data scientist. My current career goal is to be hired as a data analyst in a large company for my first job. Currently, Oxford's program is more appealing in that regard due to its lower costs and the opportunity to get some internships in the UK after graduation.\n\nHowever, my family and friends are are telling me to go to Harvard, because apparently the 'brand value' of Harvard exceeds that of Oxford's in our country, on top of the fact that it is more rigorous. Also they are making it sound like I can just go for a phd if you can't get internships in the US after graduation (which I think is a bit ridiculous because I'm not even thinking of a phd right now, and phds are not things you can get just because you want to). Yeah the sentiment here is a bit America-centric and they all prefer masters degrees from the US (I personally do not think Oxford's brand value is worse than that of Harvard's).\n\nBased on this, I am stuck in a dilemma. I really don't know which university to choose and both sound seriously appealing to me.

I joined as an intern earning peanuts after my MS and just got made full time last month. Current package is more livable but well below market average. \n\nA couple days ago a recruiter from a company I was targeting post grad (e-commerce/retail) reached out to me. we had a call about an Analyst role opening up and they were interested in my profile. In a nut shell I got the impression that the job was primarily dashboarding. I mentioned I\u2019m currently learning and working on ML problems and that\u2019s what I want to continue doing. So the consensus was that there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s I\u2019d be interested in now but as they build out their BI dept something will eventually pop up. \n\nAnyway, my heads been turned. The package they would offer is at least 2x what I\u2019m making now. I saw the job posting in linked in yesterday and to my surprise one of the requirements is experience with ML! \n\nI\u2019ve been with my current company for 7 months and it\u2019s not bad but not great either.
