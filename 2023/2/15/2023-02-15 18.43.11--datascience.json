This post is mainly just to ask whether what I'm experiencing is common within professional data science. \n\nThe main crux of my role is deriving datasets from raw data. It might be as simple as creating flags based on the value within a column or it could be a little more involved with summarising and cross-tabbing. The thing is, once I've created the dataset and it's been QA'ed and sent off, I don't actually do any analysis to it. I don't look for insights or interesting features or make predictions, perhaps the only EDA I do is to look for anomalies to make sure something hasn't gone wrong in the processing. \n\nMy first proper project in the first few months was to create one such dataset, once that was finished I was then put onto recreating an existing dataset using different and more reusable data sources. Our department has a data engineering and data modelling team which also derive some datasets but I've never had to use them as I never seem to do any actual analysis. \n\nBasically, is this normal? I anticipated that lots of the job would be data cleaning and manipulation, but I seem to be doing the bulk of the actual coding and putting together of the data without then getting to do anything with it. I don't think I've even made a histogram yet. \n\nWhat is frustrating is that there's a fairly sizeable bonus to salary offered if you can demonstrate that you're using advanced data science or analytical techniques, however I rarely (if ever) get the opportunity to actually use them therefore I doubt I'll be able to get the bonus.\n\nI'm weighing up my options. I'd like to stick around for at least a year and there's the potential to go up to senior data scientist. What I'm missing currently to go up to senior are the usual soft skills like interdepartmental communication, managing projects, time management and decision making. All things which I would build up if I stick at this job, what I'm concerned about is how my actual data science projects would translate to applying to other companies in the future.

This post is mainly just to ask whether what I&amp;#39;m experiencing is common within professional data science. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main crux of my role is deriving datasets from raw data. It might be as simple as creating flags based on the value within a column or it could be a little more involved with summarising and cross-tabbing. The thing is, once I&amp;#39;ve created the dataset and it&amp;#39;s been QA&amp;#39;ed and sent off, I don&amp;#39;t actually do any analysis to it. I don&amp;#39;t look for insights or interesting features or make predictions, perhaps the only EDA I do is to look for anomalies to make sure something hasn&amp;#39;t gone wrong in the processing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first proper project in the first few months was to create one such dataset, once that was finished I was then put onto recreating an existing dataset using different and more reusable data sources. Our department has a data engineering and data modelling team which also derive some datasets but I&amp;#39;ve never had to use them as I never seem to do any actual analysis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, is this normal? I anticipated that lots of the job would be data cleaning and manipulation, but I seem to be doing the bulk of the actual coding and putting together of the data without then getting to do anything with it. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve even made a histogram yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is frustrating is that there&amp;#39;s a fairly sizeable bonus to salary offered if you can demonstrate that you&amp;#39;re using advanced data science or analytical techniques, however I rarely (if ever) get the opportunity to actually use them therefore I doubt I&amp;#39;ll be able to get the bonus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m weighing up my options. I&amp;#39;d like to stick around for at least a year and there&amp;#39;s the potential to go up to senior data scientist. What I&amp;#39;m missing currently to go up to senior are the usual soft skills like interdepartmental communication, managing projects, time management and decision making. All things which I would build up if I stick at this job, what I&amp;#39;m concerned about is how my actual data science projects would translate to applying to other companies in the future.

At my job (consulting) my team was asked to improve the monitoring of project advancement at the client's firm. In particular, they struggle with defining a milestone baseline at T0 and sticking to it without rescheduling. They would also like a theoretical economic advancement of the project to compare against the actual technical progress (mainly SW development projects). \n\nThe manager proposed a \"per-case\" approach, which means defining with the client's Project Manager at T0 the most probable date of each milestone and the project duration, while estimating a corresponding economical effort for each milestone, to be divided for each milestone duration.\n\nSince we actually have last year's reporting data on this process, I thought about proposing a more statistic-based approach. \n\nI would like to create a model where for each Project Manager/Project we create a \"standard baseline\" based on the historical data, and a \"deviation model\" based on the project/task rescheduling pattern of the past year. In my mind, this would allow the generation of all the project baselines in a more structured way than discussing every single milestone relying only on the Project Manager's gut feeling. This would also allow some \"rolling\" adjustments to the deviation model while every monthly monitoring cycle is closed.\n\nNow, I am just starting to look into linear regression algorithms, could this be the right approach for this project? I kinda cannot figure out how to build the database for this. I do not have a data scientist in my team to brainstorm together, unfortunately. My main concerns are:\n\n1- Not all of last year's projects did not start at T0, and they do not have the same duration. I take that to properly analyze the data I would need to fill those NaN with something, but I can't really stretch the time series or put the average value, since it's a % progression from 0 to 100%. Would it be of any help if I, for a start, reset all the projects as they were starting at T0?\n\n2- Some projects from the past year are still rolling, so I do not have all the data points up to 100%, can I still make a somewhat accurate estimation?\n\n3- I imagine the dataset defined by a column for each project, with on each row below the % of advancement for each monitoring cycle (1 month). I guess this is correct, but how do I fit in the same structure also the \"deviation\" for each project?\n\n4- I take that once the problem has been framed, it would still be needed a lot of coding and testing all the hypotheses, but I can put a small team with some python knowledge to work on that. What are the steps I cannot miss in order to deliver a sound baseline/deviation forecasting model?\n\n5- I looked for some literature examples exactly on this use case, but I couldn't find much.
