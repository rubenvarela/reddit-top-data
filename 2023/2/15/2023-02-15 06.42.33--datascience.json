I\u2019m afraid that the advanced skills I acquired are slowly fading away and I\u2019m learning a lot of bad habits from my manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would you recommend in my situation to stay on the right track? I usually work through my lunch breaks too (I know, I know), but I had an idea of maybe using that time to read a stats book or something DS-related - any suggestions? Any advice is appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: the reason I put &amp;quot;Ivy League School&amp;quot; is because, a couple of months ago, my manager gave me an impossible task; I asked for a suggestion on how to better approach this task, and she responded with &amp;quot;well, I&amp;#39;m not the one with the Master&amp;#39;s Degree from the Ivy Leagues.&amp;quot; I got so butthurt from this because I haven&amp;#39;t brought it up once since joining the company lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: want to break into DS through low-maturity analytics job but feeling like it has a negative effect on my career potential - tips?\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "111wcmt", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "busy_bee_movie", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/111wcmt/is_it_a_mistake_to_enter_ds_through_lowmaturity/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/111wcmt/is_it_a_mistake_to_enter_ds_through_lowmaturity/", "subreddit_subscribers": 847946, "created_utc": 1676357925.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "hey, im currently a 3rd year data science student looking to improve my DSA skills.

I was trying to web scrape the data from companies&amp;#39; websites and faced a few issues:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Every company website is different and they do not all have the &amp;quot;Investor relations&amp;quot; page in the same place. How can I write one program to get the data of all the listed stocks? which are around&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All the websites I checked had the data in pdf documents that you download. This was a problem since I was trying to get the data right off the website HTML  and javascript code. The documents are also full of useless pages I do not need. I only need the tables.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say I download the documents and want to visualize the data and put it into dashboards. how would I extract information from documents in that scanned format?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find specific information on this because the entire modern world can just use &lt;strong&gt;APIs&lt;/strong&gt; to get this kind of data. I am absolutely certain that does not exist for the Egyptian exchange. At least at a price below thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can I start doing in order to collect this kind of data? It must be possible. I know organizations are capable of scraping the web for incredible amounts of data and useful information. How do they do it and how are these &lt;strong&gt;APIs&lt;/strong&gt; made?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is an example IR page for a company I&amp;#39;m interested in :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

So you cannot really do  question answering on a huge knowledge base with these models.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  can try to fine-tune your own text generation model for that (like  GPT-3, GPT-J, etc.) but results are sometimes disappointing as the  fine-tuned models tends to forget some of the facts mentioned in the  dataset...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At NLP Cloud, the  strategy we prefer is about mixing semantic search and question  answering. Here is a quick article about how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://nlpcloud.com/question-answering-on-domain-knowledge-with-semantic-search-and-text-generation.html?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_campaign=h5d7a9cc-3816-11ed-a261-0242ac140006\"&gt;https://nlpcloud.com/question-answering-on-domain-knowledge-with-semantic-search-and-text-generation.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, this is the best way to get both a fluent and user friendly answer while being very accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Can you think of a better strategy for question answering on very large documents?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julien&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/mHYCtcmhwvyno0-uAta4G_T1My3-otrPscUd2OjvMes.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d3760fef3f1ab6bf1d1dbe5461b5e2df024b7dd7", "width": 1024, "height": 683}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/mHYCtcmhwvyno0-uAta4G_T1My3-otrPscUd2OjvMes.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2f32d166764978c9cd7cea214169c858b7f31626", "width": 108, "height": 72}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/mHYCtcmhwvyno0-uAta4G_T1My3-otrPscUd2OjvMes.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=330e05b09bb97fe6ac21be1ffc757f8fa7cf101a", "width": 216, "height": 144}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/mHYCtcmhwvyno0-uAta4G_T1My3-otrPscUd2OjvMes.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb05b30bd6775eca0fdf8ab431ffd783c78a3c3d", "width": 320, "height": 213}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/mHYCtcmhwvyno0-uAta4G_T1My3-otrPscUd2OjvMes.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9d3e65e7ececfa70c71c17229f1689ccf7e4e577", "width": 640, "height": 426}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/mHYCtcmhwvyno0-uAta4G_T1My3-otrPscUd2OjvMes.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=49bce8862474499c1b35d696de560211bd6ba757", "width": 960, "height": 640}], "variants": {}, "id": "jQb1GRiS1-tsk2CyjgZgae0Y0DSRywZFiupWPpk_E6M"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "4fad7108-d77d-11e7-b0c6-0ee69f155af2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1120br9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "juliensalinas", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/1120br9/question_answering_on_domain_knowledge_with/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1120br9/question_answering_on_domain_knowledge_with/", "subreddit_subscribers": 847946, "created_utc": 1676368470.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
