I'm not the most experienced Data Scientist out there but I would consider myself a little more experienced than your average new grad having done a lot of analysis, modeling, and data engineering work with some very experienced data scientists across different subject areas.  \n\nAs I was interviewing I decided that I wanted to stick in a specific space in sustainability so I found a local company (150 employees) that does very software-heavy consulting in the space for a lot of F50 companies. I was very excited as these guys seemed to be experts in this space so I would learn a lot of modeling and subject matter expertise. I started this last week and after the first day I got home and I wanted to sob my eyes out because this org was worse than I could've imagined. I told myself I'd spend at least a few weeks learning and observing before making a judgment but what I've seen this week has me scared. \n\nAs far as I can tell, this is a very top-down org, with way too many middle managers. The CTO helped found the company many years ago and has a forestry background and acts more like head of IT instead of CTO. They religiously use enterprise software from Microsoft (ok preference whatever). They require you to install monitoring software on your personal cell phone that can access everything so you can use teams (I said fuck it and didn't get teams on my phone). These were surprising but I said okay fine. At the end of the day they are a consulting org that is trying to turn into a technology company. There are a lot of signs that they are trying to work towards change but they just don't know what they don't know. \n\nOn the actual tech side, things are a nightmare. Out of 20 or so IC developers, there is only one that is a senior and he had a year of experience there and was straight out of a PhD in a natural science field. They split folks up into developers and analysts, developers work in Javascript and python while analysts work in excel. Very few of the developers actually have CS experience, they are mostly econ backgrounds. My official title is Data Scientist after I refused the Developer/Analyst title they initially offered me. Come to find out my first week all of the ICs are fresh out of school with no real production experience and it shows: secrets committed in git, stuff being hardcoded in not used in env variables, not following any paradigms at all (no oop, no functional, no procedural programming just spaghetti), no real code reviews or quality control, doing Reinforcement Learning models in excel (more impressive than anything), Data isn't versioned, experiments aren't logged, almost no documentation anywhere for technical architecture or decisions. All of the heads of 'development' or managers of the developers are subject matter experts (albeit very very good at this subject matter) and they are the ones that do code reviews hence the messes.

I&amp;#39;m not the most experienced Data Scientist out there but I would consider myself a little more experienced than your average new grad having done a lot of analysis, modeling, and data engineering work with some very experienced data scientists across different subject areas.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was interviewing I decided that I wanted to stick in a specific space in sustainability so I found a local company (150 employees) that does very software-heavy consulting in the space for a lot of F50 companies. I was very excited as these guys seemed to be experts in this space so I would learn a lot of modeling and subject matter expertise. I started this last week and after the first day I got home and I wanted to sob my eyes out because this org was worse than I could&amp;#39;ve imagined. I told myself I&amp;#39;d spend at least a few weeks learning and observing before making a judgment but what I&amp;#39;ve seen this week has me scared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, this is a very top-down org, with way too many middle managers. The CTO helped found the company many years ago and has a forestry background and acts more like head of IT instead of CTO. They religiously use enterprise software from Microsoft (ok preference whatever). They require you to install monitoring software on your personal cell phone that can access everything so you can use teams (I said fuck it and didn&amp;#39;t get teams on my phone). These were surprising but I said okay fine. At the end of the day they are a consulting org that is trying to turn into a technology company. There are a lot of signs that they are trying to work towards change but they just don&amp;#39;t know what they don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the actual tech side, things are a nightmare. Out of 20 or so IC developers, there is only one that is a senior and he had a year of experience there and was straight out of a PhD in a natural science field. They split folks up into developers and analysts, developers work in Javascript and python while analysts work in excel. Very few of the developers actually have CS experience, they are mostly econ backgrounds. My official title is Data Scientist after I refused the Developer/Analyst title they initially offered me. Come to find out my first week all of the ICs are fresh out of school with no real production experience and it shows: secrets committed in git, stuff being hardcoded in not used in env variables, not following any paradigms at all (no oop, no functional, no procedural programming just spaghetti), no real code reviews or quality control, doing Reinforcement Learning models in excel (more impressive than anything), Data isn&amp;#39;t versioned, experiments aren&amp;#39;t logged, almost no documentation anywhere for technical architecture or decisions. All of the heads of &amp;#39;development&amp;#39; or managers of the developers are subject matter experts (albeit very very good at this subject matter) and they are the ones that do code reviews hence the messes. Again there are signs they are trying to do better but they don&amp;#39;t know what they don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was talking to the PM that was onboarding me and he said something along the lines of: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m very happy that we have you so we can finally start doing things the right way&amp;quot;.

And people with much more mediocre profiles than mine get in easily. So I could maybe remove lower ranked DS programs and replace with UCSD / UCD / UCLA MS BA. They have deadlines remaining (round 3 or 4). I was originally thinking to apply to BA next year if I don&amp;#39;t get any DS programs this cycle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My gpa is 7.03 / 10 (BE Mech + MS Physics degrees) from a ~top 5 institute in my country. I have 2+ YoE as a Data Scientist (applied deep learning, many projects in CV, NLP, RL). I have 1 IEEE published paper, 1 Thesis in AI (RL). GRE 326 (168Q). Although the low gpa is a concern, my profile fits much better for Data Science but isn&amp;#39;t bad for top BA programs that do have DS courses in curriculum as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m concerned with the outcomes of a BA degree - primarily high-paying opportunities (in any domain or role, matching the fairly common ~$200K Data Scientist salaries in bay area/ NYC), and prevalence of a switch back to DS / MLE / Applied research roles after the BA degree if previous work demonstrates proficiency in ML/DL. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is the high-end employability after MSBA, which sort of roles and responsibilities are more common ? How do you compare it to MS DS outcomes? What may I dislike/ be surprised by, in a BA degree or role? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I already don&amp;#39;t love the curriculum. It&amp;#39;s all hand-wavy business-oriented courses barely teaching any hard skills. More stats, very less ML if any. Marketing, Finance etc is not something I&amp;#39;ve ever been exposed to, so I may learn something new that I couldn&amp;#39;t have using free UC Berkeley lecture series. But I&amp;#39;m mainly looking for high paying outcomes and growth opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "110e2ak", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anotheraccount97", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/110e2ak/low_ranked_data_science_ms_vs_high_ranked_uc/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/110e2ak/low_ranked_data_science_ms_vs_high_ranked_uc/", "subreddit_subscribers": 847197, "created_utc": 1676202967.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am interested in a data engineering role.
