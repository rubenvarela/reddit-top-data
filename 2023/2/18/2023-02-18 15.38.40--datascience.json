I am doing Courses from Coursera and going through books to learn important concepts of Statistics, Probability, etc. But I lack practical experience in main python programming. I can create the codes I want using google or reading the documentation, but I don&amp;#39;t know the syntax in my head. Like I know they exist but I have to them up(For JAVA this is not a major issue).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  had only basic knowledge of python, but for my job, I created an Automation  Testing framework using SeleniumBase and python without any prior knowledge of the Subject. I could do this as I have experience building mobile applications and web development, going through the documentation and finding solutions on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the issue is I feel like it would be awkward to google search things during any interview that I will have since I don&amp;#39;t know the basic syntax of python(Even though I can create most of the programs that will be requested of me). I know the basics but I struggle with the Lambda function, apply function, the advanced syntax of for loop etc. How do I get good at this? where can I get practice for high-level python without learning what variables or loops are from the beginning?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "a6ee6fa0-d780-11e7-b6d0-0e0bd8823a7e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "114nrkc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Intelligent_Put8678", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/114nrkc/guidance_regarding_python_practice_for_data/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/114nrkc/guidance_regarding_python_practice_for_data/", "subreddit_subscribers": 849006, "created_utc": 1676646737.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "datascience", "selftext": "I (23) am a part of my mid sized organisation's ( new )  analytics team ( freshers ) of about 5-7.

As a person whose only notions of basketball come from Space Jam, this surprised me. Wasn't the guy the best out there? How could someone who's best in his field ruin it? After hearing the argument out though, I began to understand what the video was really getting at: to them, Michael Jordan had ruined the field BECAUSE he was so good. A sport that was once full of diverse personalities and strategies then turned into multiple teams trying to produce their own Michael Jordan copycat with copycat moves and copycat strategies.\n\nI'm not well versed enough in basketball to know how right or wrong that guy was. But this concept that something could ruin an entire field simply by being too good stuck with me. And all these years later, I consistently think about it while doing my job as a Data Scientist. And the more GPT-X and ChatGPT advance, the more this concept haunts me.\n\nI've been working in this field for 5 years. During the first 4 years, the job was exciting. Every new problem required extensive research on my part: looking for papers, datasets, implementations, implementing my own stuff, experimenting, comparing the results... That was the biggest part of my job. Yeah I still had to do some software engineering stuff here and there, but I felt like I had a well defined and specialized role at my company. Even in the NLP field, the variety of technologies I had to work with was a lot of fun: sometimes I used RNNs, sometimes embedding based similarity functions, sometimes more classic approaches, and then towards the end it was transformer after transformer, but at least I still had to finetune them myself.\n\nOver the past few months and years, this has started to change, however. GPT-1 and 2 were promising, but were more of a proof of concept than anything realistically usable. But with GPT3's and ChatGPT's latest performance, it feels like NLP is becoming more and more standardized. I wouldn't call it a solved field, far from it. But, sadly, unless you work for a big tech company,  I think the days of exploratory research-type work in the NLP field are over.\n\nEven in academia, the latest NLP papers I've seen come out of prestigious universities went from actual engineering/mathematical advances to \"Look, if you \"engineer\" the prompt like this, it works better sometimes!\"\n\nAnd now, with the exploding popularity of ChatGPT, any random lambda would come to the conclusion that if you need to use AI, ChatGPT is the answer.\n\nNow, some of you may already be thinking \"but hold on, with my finetuned transformer I get a 1% increase in accuracy over out-of-the-box GPT-3!\". The thing is: even if you can, it doesn't really matter. I really doubt the sales team of your company is gonna pay much attention to your pleas to give you 6 months to work on a product rather than 6 minutes. Because yes, that's the increase in productivity we're dealing with: What took me months a few years ago only takes minutes now. The range of problems I can apply NLP too has also increased, as out-of-the-box GPT-3 works well enough not to require a dataset for more \"general\" tasks. And the results are either comparable or even better.\n\nIn the span of a year, NLP went from my favorite ML field to one I never see myself working in again if given the choice. And while a lot of non NLP fields are, for now, untouched by the exploding popularity of the GPT family, I'm afraid that what happened to the NLP field will be replicated in other fields, and that in a few years, only super specialized issues won't have a solution somewhere in the form of a ridiculously big model accessible via an API key provided by a big tech company. And even if GPT3 was open source, the sheer size of it makes it close to impossible to realistically train for anything less than the biggest of tech companies out there. Even finetuning it would be a challenge.\n\nI'm not saying the job of data scientist will disappear, in fact, I'd say it will be asked more than ever since boomers who don't understand what the title actually implies will want some in their company.

Instead we'll have to become even bigger software engineer/data analyst/DevOps/project manager hybrids than we already were.
