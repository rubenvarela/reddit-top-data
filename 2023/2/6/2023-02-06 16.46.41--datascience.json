I've been searching for a summer internship in Data Science/Data Analytics since September and have had no luck. I've reached out to people in my network and those of my family and professors wherever possible, and I've visited my university's career center several times for resume revisions and have adopted the various strategies they have suggested. I've submitted somewhere in the ballpark of 200 applications in the last 6 months, and I've been ghosted by most recruiters. Of the 200 applications, I received 4 callbacks for interviews, and of those 4, only 1 resulted in a follow-up interview. For this last position, I was well-prepared and felt that I performed well in both interviews, but alas, I finally received yet another rejection letter last week.\n\nI'm frustrated and disappointed, to say the least. I understand that these numbers are pretty typical in the current tech job market, and other Redditors frequently call it a \"numbers game.\" While merely continuing a barrage of new applications may work for new graduates and recently laid-off junior positions, I'm fighting against time since I'm looking for a summer internship that ends before I resume classes in the fall. At this current rate, I'd have to submit another 50 applications to get a chance of even one more interview, which is incredibly time-consuming. The job search process wore me out months ago - I'm discouraged and exhausted - and it takes valuable time away from actually practicing my skills and learning new topics. On top of that, it already feels too late. My academic advisor told me in October to try to have something figured out by the end of December since many internship positions would already be filled beyond that point. It's now February. If my odds were bad 6 months ago, it's only going to get worse.\n\nI'm kind of at my wits' end. I also am approaching the point where I need to have some concrete summer plans so I can coordinate schedules with family and friends, not just \"I'm looking for an internship\" because that doesn't seem to be panning out. Here are a few of my options:\n\n1. Go back to the summer camp where I worked for the last two years.\n   1. Pros: I already have friends there and I'm 99% guaranteed a job if I apply. I'll also be on the West Coast, which is where I want to be.\n   2. Cons: The pay is little more than a volunteer stipend. I won't have much opportunity to develop tech skills or otherwise advance my career.\n2. Stay at home for the summer. I could split my time between learning through online MOOCs and potentially look for a low-skill job such as administrative assistant or data entry. Or a gig like Doordash. \n   1. Pros: I can live with my family for free. I'll also be on the West Coast and will have the flexibility to pursue my outdoor hobbies while working on tech skills. The wage floor is also pretty high in my state.\n   2. Cons: There's no guarantee that I can find a job, especially for something that only lasts the summer when employers may be wanting something more permanent. It also feels kind of humiliating that I failed to find a job in my industry?\n3. Look for internships in adjacent fields that involve data. I've seen this suggested to people looking to make a career switch but I'm not sure if these exist or if they will work for me. I also won't have the mentorship in DS/DA that I'm specifically looking for. \n\nWhat factors should I take into consideration when I look at my options for this summer? Is there anything else as far as career development that I should also think about? \n\nI'm also wondering if the current scarcity of tech positions is homogeneous across the industry. DS doesn't seem as attractive as it was a few years ago, and now I feel unsure about all of my career/academic choices to date.\n\nFirst, I feel like DS was hyped up to more than it was when I first started college as a freshman, and now it seems that a lot of people on the internet also think that it's now on the decline. It also seems to be the consensus that the best path into DS is through a more established undergrad program in CS, Math, or Stats, rather than a DS degree because they tend to be so broad in nature that you learn a little bit about many topics but nothing sufficiently in-depth to be useful. Unfortunately, that seems to be my experience - I don't feel like I'm learning anything in classes so I'm taking time outside of class to work on Kaggle Learn courses and the Andrew Ng Coursera ML course. If I could go back in time, I would have gone into CS and started at a different university. I'm not particularly fond of my university or the Midwest (I long to be back on the West Coast) and it's a long story of how I ended up here, but suffice it to say that the reason I'm still here is because I'm on a full-tuition scholarship which I'd lose if I transferred elsewhere. But I can't go back in time. I'm a junior and should be graduating in two more semesters after this semester, so I had been OK with sticking it out under the assumption that I could get a decent job when I graduate and move back to the West Coast. But I'm at the point where I question if any of that is true. \n\nSecond, I'm not even sure anymore if this is really what I want to do. In my senior year of high school I became really interested in finance, and DS seemed like the perfect way to join my long standing interest in tech with what a growing interest in math (which, sidenote, may have died after I took Intro to Linear Algebra. I like to think it was just a bad professor) and my new interest in business topics. In the last semester or so, I've clarified my long-term goals and want to break into the ML field and eventually become an MLE. However, in working with scikit-learn and other ML frameworks in Kaggle Learn courses, it feels dull and I'm just doing it because I have gaps in my knowledge. I don't really find myself loving it. Is this normal? I know it's preferable to work on my own projects rather than repetitive activities, but I still don't feel that I know enough skills to work on my own projects.

I&amp;#39;ve been searching for a summer internship in Data Science/Data Analytics since September and have had no luck. I&amp;#39;ve reached out to people in my network and those of my family and professors wherever possible, and I&amp;#39;ve visited my university&amp;#39;s career center several times for resume revisions and have adopted the various strategies they have suggested. I&amp;#39;ve submitted somewhere in the ballpark of 200 applications in the last 6 months, and I&amp;#39;ve been ghosted by most recruiters. Of the 200 applications, I received 4 callbacks for interviews, and of those 4, only 1 resulted in a follow-up interview. For this last position, I was well-prepared and felt that I performed well in both interviews, but alas, I finally received yet another rejection letter last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m frustrated and disappointed, to say the least. I understand that these numbers are pretty typical in the current tech job market, and other Redditors frequently call it a &amp;quot;numbers game.&amp;quot; While merely continuing a barrage of new applications may work for new graduates and recently laid-off junior positions, I&amp;#39;m fighting against time since I&amp;#39;m looking for a summer internship that ends before I resume classes in the fall. At this current rate, I&amp;#39;d have to submit another 50 applications to get a chance of even one more interview, which is incredibly time-consuming. The job search process wore me out months ago - I&amp;#39;m discouraged and exhausted - and it takes valuable time away from actually practicing my skills and learning new topics. On top of that, it already feels too late. My academic advisor told me in October to try to have something figured out by the end of December since many internship positions would already be filled beyond that point. It&amp;#39;s now February. If my odds were bad 6 months ago, it&amp;#39;s only going to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m kind of at my wits&amp;#39; end. I also am approaching the point where I need to have some concrete summer plans so I can coordinate schedules with family and friends, not just &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m looking for an internship&amp;quot; because that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be panning out. Here are a few of my options:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go back to the summer camp where I worked for the last two years.\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pros: I already have friends there and I&amp;#39;m 99% guaranteed a job if I apply. I&amp;#39;ll also be on the West Coast, which is where I want to be.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cons: The pay is little more than a volunteer stipend. I won&amp;#39;t have much opportunity to develop tech skills or otherwise advance my career.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stay at home for the summer. I could split my time between learning through online MOOCs and potentially look for a low-skill job such as administrative assistant or data entry. Or a gig like Doordash. \n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pros: I can live with my family for free. I&amp;#39;ll also be on the West Coast and will have the flexibility to pursue my outdoor hobbies while working on tech skills. The wage floor is also pretty high in my state.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cons: There&amp;#39;s no guarantee that I can find a job, especially for something that only lasts the summer when employers may be wanting something more permanent. It also feels kind of humiliating that I failed to find a job in my industry?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Look for internships in adjacent fields that involve data. I&amp;#39;ve seen this suggested to people looking to make a career switch but I&amp;#39;m not sure if these exist or if they will work for me. I also won&amp;#39;t have the mentorship in DS/DA that I&amp;#39;m specifically looking for. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What factors should I take into consideration when I look at my options for this summer? Is there anything else as far as career development that I should also think about? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also wondering if the current scarcity of tech positions is homogeneous across the industry. DS doesn&amp;#39;t seem as attractive as it was a few years ago, and now I feel unsure about all of my career/academic choices to date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I feel like DS was hyped up to more than it was when I first started college as a freshman, and now it seems that a lot of people on the internet also think that it&amp;#39;s now on the decline. It also seems to be the consensus that the best path into DS is through a more established undergrad program in CS, Math, or Stats, rather than a DS degree because they tend to be so broad in nature that you learn a little bit about many topics but nothing sufficiently in-depth to be useful. Unfortunately, that seems to be my experience - I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;m learning anything in classes so I&amp;#39;m taking time outside of class to work on Kaggle Learn courses and the Andrew Ng Coursera ML course. If I could go back in time, I would have gone into CS and started at a different university. I&amp;#39;m not particularly fond of my university or the Midwest (I long to be back on the West Coast) and it&amp;#39;s a long story of how I ended up here, but suffice it to say that the reason I&amp;#39;m still here is because I&amp;#39;m on a full-tuition scholarship which I&amp;#39;d lose if I transferred elsewhere. But I can&amp;#39;t go back in time. I&amp;#39;m a junior and should be graduating in two more semesters after this semester, so I had been OK with sticking it out under the assumption that I could get a decent job when I graduate and move back to the West Coast. But I&amp;#39;m at the point where I question if any of that is true. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, I&amp;#39;m not even sure anymore if this is really what I want to do. In my senior year of high school I became really interested in finance, and DS seemed like the perfect way to join my long standing interest in tech with what a growing interest in math (which, sidenote, may have died after I took Intro to Linear Algebra. I like to think it was just a bad professor) and my new interest in business topics. In the last semester or so, I&amp;#39;ve clarified my long-term goals and want to break into the ML field and eventually become an MLE. However, in working with scikit-learn and other ML frameworks in Kaggle Learn courses, it feels dull and I&amp;#39;m just doing it because I have gaps in my knowledge. I don&amp;#39;t really find myself loving it. Is this normal? I know it&amp;#39;s preferable to work on my own projects rather than repetitive activities, but I still don&amp;#39;t feel that I know enough skills to work on my own projects. I often wonder if I&amp;#39;d be better off in a more standard CS track towards become an SWE or backend web dev. But there&amp;#39;s huge gaps in my knowledge there as well. And if I switch majors, I&amp;#39;ll probably have to take an extra semester or two because my current DS requirements don&amp;#39;t include any of the dev, networking, or security classes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess to summarize, I went into this degree track with certain expectations and everything has turned out to be a disappointment. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do anymore because although I&amp;#39;m willing to work hard, it&amp;#39;s difficult to maintain the motivation to do so when I&amp;#39;m not sure if everything I&amp;#39;m doing is mere futility.
