I just want a place to vent and get feedback - I feel discouraged and frustrated. About three weeks ago, I had an initial screening with a recruiter from a tech start-up based in Europe. It led to a technical interview for a remote data engineering role (US) with them. The first technical interview went well, and I was informed that the next step would be a take-home assignment. The assignment asked me to do pretty much what I would be doing if I received the position:\n\n1. Write an API that connects to one of their datasets\n2. include multiple parameters for aggregation, querying, and filtering\n3. put it on the cloud\n4. write documentation for it\n5. Write a report of why you chose the tools you did and what you would do differently.\n\nThe time limit on the assignment was approximately three hours. This struck me as a red flag because I felt like this was a lot of work to accomplish in less than half a work day (I would love your thoughts on that, actually. Maybe I'm just slow.)? The assignment was also very open-ended. There was no mention of which dataset to connect to, how to connect to it, which tools to use, or really any expectations on their end.\n\nI'm not a fan of take-home assignments because I've heard horror stories of people getting used for their free work. Since it was so open-ended, only three hours long, and the interviewer was super chill when talking about the assignment (\"We just need something to get a feel for your Python skills\") I assumed it was ok to build a small application showcasing the fundamentals of API development.\n\nI used one of their smaller datasets, coded my API in Python using Django and Pandas, hosted it on an EC2 instance, and wrote markdown documentation. In my report, I mention how I would use Spark, tokenization (I was working with text data), and a proper database if I were to make this app production grade. I included all the drawbacks of my current application and how I would fix them - because of course - the assignment was only supposed to be three hours long, and there was only so much I was willing to do for a take-home assignment. I felt like this was a lot of work as it is, and it took me roughly 6.5 hours to complete.\n\nAfter submitting my assignment, I got an email the next day telling me I did a great job and they would like to proceed with the second technical interview. The second interview ended well, with the interviewer telling me they would schedule a final interview with the CTO. Instead, I received another email three days later stating that the company decided to terminate my interview process. They said it was because my app was not using a large enough dataset, my code wasn't efficient enough, pretty much telling me that it wasn't applicable for a large-scale system. ????????. Of course not? This is a take-home assignment that was supposed to take 3 hours to finish. I am honestly baffled. Is this normal? I understand there are people out there who probably can write an enterprise-level API in 3 hours, but even so, why do it for free during the interview process? At this point, I feel a bit sketched out and like I dodged a bullet.

implementing a data lakehouse using Databricks and Unity Catalog. \n\nMy coworkers were telling me about the design of the landing container. We have several source systems and they will transfer their data to the ADLS bucket on an hourly basis to folders like source_system/domain/item/YYYY/MM/DD/HH. The data are CDC logs in JSON format. \n\nThis part is straightforward and I can understand it.\n\nThe next part is the part I have questions about: we have jobs that will read the raw files from the landing container and basically turn them into delta format. We have a design that involves 3 folders \u201clanding\u201d, \u201cworking\u201d, \u201carchived\u201d. Whenever you start a job that involves that file, you would move that file on the landing container from a \u201clanding\u201d folder to a \u201cworking\u201d folder. Then once the job is completed, we are supposed to move the file from the \u201cworking\u201d folder to an \u201carchived\u201d folder.\n\nA problem arises when we have several jobs that involves the same file. Let\u2019s say both job A and job B uses that raw file, and they\u2019re sequential. When job A is done with the file, it moves it to an \u201carchived\u201d folder. Now job B, which expects the file to be in the \u201clanding\u201d folder, can no longer locate the file, because it\u2019s been moved to the \u201carchived\u201d folder. It is even a bigger problem when both job A and job B are happening at the same time. \n\nMy coworkers tell me that this is intentional and what should actually happen is that we are supposed to create 2 copies of the raw file, or in the case of 3 jobs being dependent on the file, then 3 copies. We would have to rename the item to something like item_copy1, item_copy2. \n\nThe reason is that this is a best practice because now the state of where the file is will reflect the status of the job. Upon a job success, files are always moved to the \u201carchived\u201d folder. The \u201clanding\u201d and \u201cworking\u201d folders should always be empty after a job. If they are not empty, it will help indicate to us that some error happened to the job.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a design like this before and I\u2019m used to the design where once a file is in the landing container, we don\u2019t move it and we only read from it. We use Airflow to track the success of individual jobs instead of the file location. But my coworkers told me this would be brittle design as now I am too reliant of Airflow for information on the status of the job. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could educate me or point me to resources that explain this type of design to me more. Or correct me if this is some well-known best practice that I\u2019m misunderstanding and butchering. I want to understand the rationale behind creating copies and moving files to an \u201carchived\u201d folder and its benefits.", "author_fullname": "t2_13lfsb", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Data lakehouse architecture - design of landing container", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataengineering", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_10qzlma", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1675270728.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1675270547.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dataengineering", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m currently a new DE at my company and we\u2019re designing and implementing a data lakehouse using Databricks and Unity Catalog. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My coworkers were telling me about the design of the landing container.

I don't have any job experience, because I did my master's straight after my undergrad (biochemistry).\n\nAfter researching this subreddit, I have a clear idea of what skills to pick up and how to do it. However, I'm not sure which approach in terms of job hunting to take in order to make it more realistic.\n\nShould I:\n\n1. Focus on learning and simultaneously applying for junior DE positions until I land a role?\n2. Start by finding a data analyst or similar data-related job to gain experience?\n3. Target a specific role that will help me make the transition to data engineering more easily?\n\nI would appreciate your thoughts and suggestions.
