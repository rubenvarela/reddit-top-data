But about 70-80 per cent of my time is spent on just cleaning the data to have it look exactly how I want it to look. \n\nFor example, those date columns with values like \"Sat April 3rd\", I will have to break into two columns one for day and one for the date. Then lots of pivot tables, group by's with functions that feed into a dictionary of aggregate functions because I have many columns that work completely differently, etc. \n\nI usually do all of this using Python. It's not easy, but it gets the job done for the most part. Some parts of this task/process is easier in Excel: replacing nonsensical values with average (I do ctrl + shift + L, select everything but the nonsense, then find the average of the useful information, unselect, then do a replace all for the nonsense). \n\nI find this a tad bit tedious. Especially if the dataset is too large (say 2000 columns, a couple hundred thousand rows) Excel gets laggy, I have to do the same thing for 2000 columns, etc. Even python sometimes fails to do what I need it to do. \n\nSay for example I have a dataset that has 30 columns for days of a month. I want those column names (Apr 1st, Apr 2nd, ...) to go into just one column as values of \"date\" and aggregate the information by those days somehow. \n\nTo do this in python, I have to take so many steps to get there.

I'm comfortable with SQL as I used it during an internship 4 years ago. I just need to refresh my mind. I don't like R, but will learn if I need to. I'm most comfortable with Python.

If SQL does this better, then I'll get started on that. If it's python, then I'd appreciate some resources on this. Also, what exactly is this process? Is it just pre-processing and data cleaning?
